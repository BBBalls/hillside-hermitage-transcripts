**Ajahn Nyanamoli**: A simple question. Why is pain a problem?

**Thaniyo Thero**: I don't want it.

**AN**: Which is first, you don't want it, thus it's a problem, or it's a problem, thus you don't want it?

**TT**: What is first?
Pain.

**AN**: Yeah, pain is not wanted, pain is a problem.
Why is a pain a problem that's not wanted?

**TT**: I don't want it.

**AN**: You make it a problem, because you don't want it.
If you stop resisting pain---as in stop trying to get rid of the pain---pain ceases to be a problem.

**TT**: But what if it gets too much pain?
What is too much?
Can you get too much pain?

**AN**: It depends what you mean by that. If you mean too much of painfulness of the pain, as long as you're still alive, it's not too much.
Or if you mean, this is too much of a problem for me, so I don't want it.

**TT**: So, if you don't have a problem with pain?

**AN**: Then there cannot be too much of a pain.
That's why the Buddha gave that example of highway robbers sawing your limbs off one by one.
If the mind has ill will towards them, it means it hasn't fulfilled the teaching.
Because, by fulfilling the dhamma, it's inconceivable to have ill will towards pain, or those who cause it.
It is just inconceivable, because it was not conceivable to begin with, but it was your ignorance of it that was conceiving it.

Back to the same simple question, which is a reflection anybody can do.
Why is painful feeling a problem?

**TT**: Because I prefer pleasure.

**AN**: Yeah, so why would I prefer pleasure?

**TT**: It's not pain.

**AN**: Why is it better then?
You realize you won't find an objective answer to it.
You have an attitude of no wanting pain, and you have an attitude of wanting pleasure, and your whole life is dictated by that.
But if you look at that attitude as to why is that attitude there, you won't find an answer.
It's a gratuitous attitude.
That's the only thing, the one and only reason, for human suffering of any kind.
That's what the Buddha meant by craving means suffering.
Absence of craving means absence of suffering.
Craving is that attitude.
I want this, I don't want this.

If a person just starts reflecting---not jumping into answering right away---why is pain, physical, emotion, or any pain---any disagreeable feeling that I'm experiencing---not wanted by default?
Why is that my default attitude?
By putting to yourself such a question---without providing a rational answer---you're becoming aware of that problem; the problem of your attitude.
Sometimes you have to keep that question for days as a way of contemplation.
You have to keep repeating it.
Just don't answer it.
Keep asking yourself.
Look for an answer, but don't answer it.
You're looking, but you are not allowing yourself to formulate it in the rational---psychologizing---manner.
You really want to become aware---on that emotional level---of your resistance to the unpleasant emotion.
You can give this answer or that answer, but emotionally, you'll still be resisting it, or you would still want to prolong it---if it's pleasure.
But, there is absolutely no justifiable reason for not wanting pain.
If your attitude towards your feelings matters, you would feel only what you want to feel.
In other words, feelings would be obeying the attitude.
But the fact that you're experiencing pain, which is not wanted, means you have absolutely no say in the domain of feeling.
The domain of feeling is unaware of your existence.
Feelings feel; pleasant feeling feels pleasure, unpleasant feeling feels displeasure; neutral feeling feels neither.
That's it.
You don't exist for it.
Your attitude is a self-assumed parasite upon it, because of which you suffer.
The pain, the experience of pain, does not experience the dukkha.
The experience of pain, you are resisting it, you experience the dukkha.
That's where you get to be free from suffering, and your sense of self, and the gratuitous assumption, and everything else.
But then pleasure, displeasure, and neutral remains.
Because they were never a problem.

**TT**: Pain is inevitable.

**AN**: Exactly.
Inasmuch as any feeling is inevitable for as long as you're alive.
Either pleasure, displeasure, or neither pleasure nor displeasure.

**TT**: But the attitude is...

**AN**: Gratuitous.

**TT**: Optional?

**AN**: It's not optional.
It's either you have attitude or you have undone the attitude.
It's not optional.
Even the type of attitude is not optional, because, in pleasure, you will always be wanting more pleasure; in pain you will always want to try and get rid of it; in a neutral feeling, you're always going to distract yourself from it.
Your attitude is determined by the craving.
Cravings have set outcomes.
What's optional is how you're going to go about it, but that's already far down the line.
It's not fundamental.
Fundamental is the attitude.
Fundamental is craving.
Craving for what?
Craving for more pleasure in pleasure.
Craving for absence of pain in pain.
Craving for distraction, or oblivion, in neither pleasant or unpleasant feeling.
That attitude can become apparent, if you start questioning yourself in regard to the presently enduring feeling.
What am I feeling now?
Something happened to you, somebody said something, you're upset.
Pain.
You have to stop projecting the blame, and responsibility, onto the world for your pain.
As long as you still think, "I'm suffering, because such and such person said this and this," you have a lot of work to do---as in you have many views to undo.
When you take responsibility for how you're feeling, and stop blaming the world, then you might be able to start discerning your attitude in regard to your own feeling as the only source of your suffering.
A person who fully projects onto the world as being the reason for pain, can never see that, because they haven't taken responsibility for it.
If you've taken responsibility for you being affected by your feelings, so you stop trying to talk things out with somebody who upset you.
If that's done to maintain social norms, that's fine, but you don't do it as a means of escape from your feeling.
You recognize that responsibility for you being affected by what is being felt is on you.
Not on the circumstances, not on the elements, not on other people, not of who said what, not on they did't respect me enough, or they didn't do this or they didn't do that.
No.
All of that is you took for granted the attitude of trying to get rid of this unpleasureable feeling, and then where you look, where would you go about it?
He said this, it's his fault.
This happened, I didn't have enough luck, it's everyone else's fault.
Even if people are genuinely rude and mean to you, if you suffer and encounter it, that's on you.
That's why the Buddha said the wise monk, the one with developed wisdom, and the right view, would endure harsh words, slander and all this, in the same sense you would endure elements, in the same sense you would endure heat, cold, hunger, insect bites, slanderous and abusive words, because it's on the same level, it's just elements.
But you being upset and account of it, that's on you.

So why is pain a problem?
In order to reveal the attitude, your attitude that makes the a problem, that feeds the attitude, that makes the problem, that feeds the attitude---a vicious circle.
In order to reveal it, you have to stop blaming pain for the problem.
Why is pain a problem?
You realize, "no, why do I have a problem with pain?"
That's a more accurate question, because pain in itself isn't the problem, but there is a problem in regard to the pain.
Why is that?
Because the pain is not wanted.
Why?
Why is the pain not wanted?
"Okay, I want it then."
Why would you want it then?
Why do you have to either want or not want?
Why can you just be equanimous in regard to either?
"Okay, I don't want pain, but I don't not want pain to either."
Any pain, big or small, far and near, past, future, any attitude in regard to any pain.
If you stop trying to get rid of it, then the attitude towards pleasure becomes also apparent.
Stop trying to entertain it, stop trying to make it stay longer, stop trying to get more of it.
By discerning the nature of your attitude towards pain, you also automatically start discerning the nature of your attitude towards pleasure---the gratuitous assumption of sensuality---the sensual desire and pleasure you get from it.
That doesn't mean you stop perceiving agreeable and disagreeable things; that's one thing, another thing is craving for more of it and craving for their absence and craving for your distraction.
If the nature of pain ceases to be a problem for a person, there's nothing else to do, because it doesn't matter where it comes from, from what sense, from what thought, from what experience, from what circumstance.
Pain is not resisted; pain is not feared.
Pain is not wanted either, because sometimes people would go the other way, and overly indulge pain as a mean of showing that you know...
No, if pain is arisen, it doesn't matter, that's not a problem, it's a secondary thing.
If pain arises on account of your restraint, determination and willpower, you have no problem with it.
If pain arises on account of somebody abusing you, offending you, or whatever,
you have no problem with it either.

**TT**: But you don't allow yourself to be abused.

**AN**: Well, you allow yourself to be abused when you give in to the attitude of its pain, you become abused.
That's the whole point.

**TT**: Because a lot of people think that...

**AN**: The circumstances are abusive, but you are not abused until you put the projection on the circumstances for that abuse.
If you realize that abuse, that abuse is founded upon your attitude towards the experienced feeling at the time.
If that attitude is an attitude of, "I don't want this", you made yourself affected by that abuse.

**TT**: Sexual abuse?

**AN**: Well, how can you be sexually abused?
The body can be sexually abused---physically abused.

**TT**: That's kind of the normal sexual relationship with people.

**AN**: Exactly, which means that people gratuitously take the ownership of the body to be theirs.
We all know how that ends: sickness, aging, and death, which means it was a mistake to take it as yours.
You better undo that mistake while you're alive, and reflect, "if this body were truly mine, my attitude would be the first and my feelings would be determined by it."
Not my attitude would be determined by the corresponding feeling that has arisen.
Meaning my attitude is secondary to this, yet it's acting like it's some sort of commander-in-chief.
Me resisting pain, is my attitude towards the arisen pain, which has arisen on its own.
If you were to develop the attitude of, "hold on, that's not a problem," and you stopped gratuitously resisting it, you wouldn't be able to suffer.
In the same sense, somebody attachs you, beats you up physically.
That's one thing, but through the gratuitous assumption of the ownership of that body, that's how you become beaten up and abused.
It doesn't matter what type of assault and abuse it is.
The point is, it can be done only to the body, only literally to this bag of skin filled with lots of other organs and things.
You thinking that you have a say---an ultimate say---in what befalls that body, that was your ignorance from the start.
Even if you never get physically abused, you will be abused; your body will be abused by aging, sickness and death.
That's the ultimate abuse.
No matter physical abuse---if it doesn't kill you---can amount to the abuse of death.
That is inevitable for everyone.
If you realize that the attitude of abuse comes from you accepting the ownership of the body that has been abused.
You accept ownership of the body through wanting pleasure through the body, and you accept ownership of the body through wanting to get rid of the pain through the body.
It comes down to the to the feelings that are present.
It's unpleasant feeling abuse.
You don't even think twice before you start blaming the feeling, what happened to the body, and everything else.
If you had enough mindfulness and self-reflection, you realized that it's unfortunate, but that's the subject of elements.
Form is being deformed by elements, by other bodies, by other things. 
That's just nature of life, sickness, aging, death, and  whatever accidents.
That's the nature of it.
It was actually my mistake to assume that I had the say in that domain---to gratuitously entertain the attitude of saying no to this, or saying yes, I want more of this---where I have no say in the rising of those things.
How can I have a say in prolonging it, or not arising in the first place?
How can you have a say in not wanting a rising of pain when any attitude towards pain requires pain first?
That's why it's unpleasant.
That's why you suffer, because of the discrepancy, not because of the pain.
Suffering is the discrepancy that your attitude creates in regard to the
present feeling.
If the feeling is pleasurable, you suffer when you want more of it.
The discrepancy is wanting more of a pleasant feeling, as in not enough of it.
If you were to stop wanting more of it, then you're only going to have a pleasant feeling, so there's no discrepancy---no suffering.
Consequently, you have the unpleasant feeling present, pain is present,
and you don't want that presence at all, which means you're overdoing it now.
There is some pain, but your attitude does not want any of it.
That's another discrepancy you created.

**TT**: Because there is pain.

**AN**: Because there is pain, exactly.
If all you had is your attitude towards pain, you would be in control.
But no, there is the actual pain there, and it's your attitude that contradicts it.
"No, this pain must not be," while the pain is.
"This pleasure must be greater," while it isn't.

**TT**: There's a neutral feeling.

**AN**: This neutral feeling.
What neutral feeling?
There is a neutral feeling, but you're not seeing any neutral feeling.
That's another discrepancy.
That's why when you're bored, you feel unpleasant.
When you're bored, you feel neither pleasure nor unpleasure, but that in itself is unpleasant for you.
You want to feel something, because a threshold of your discernment of feeling is pain and pleasure.
You don't even see the neutral one, and that's why it's unpleasant.
It's a slightly subtle discrepancy, but nevertheless, it's a discrepancy.

**TT**: When you know it's present.
You know the neutral feeling.

**AN**: Yeah, then you stop contradicting it.
No contradiction; no discrepancy; no discrepancy; no suffering.
Suffering is a discrepancy created when your attitude clashes with the world.
The world can present itself only in three forms, agreeable, disagreeable, and neutral.
If you deal on that level, you don't have to worry about anything else more particular than that.

**TT**: How to deal with it on that level?

**AN**: Take responsibility for whatever is being felt---as in, this is felt by me, because of my attitude towards it.
I'm making the feeling affect me, feeling of pleasure, feeling of pain, neutral feeling.
If somebody says something upsetting and the pain arises, that pain is not in what's being said.
It's not in that person.
It's not in any of the circumstances.
It's in your attitude in regard to the circumstances.
You have to take responsibility for suffering.
You don't have to take responsibility for agreeable and disagreeable, but you have to take responsibility for wanting agreeable and not wanting disagreeable.

**TT**: What do you mean by taking responsibility?

**AN**: It means seeing that it's on you.
There is no excuse.

**TT**: That attitude, its mine.

**AN**: It's my doing.

**TT**: It's my doing.

**AN**: I'm responsible for this.
When I suffer, I'm responsible for that.
Only through that attitude, you can actually get a glimpse, and maybe even go through with it.
You can figure out how to not suffer.
For as long as your attitude doesn't take on suffering as your responsibility, and conflates suffering with disagreeable circumstances---with painful circumstances---you're not going to see the nature of suffering.
How can you free yourself from it?
You have to stop blaming painful circumstances for your suffering.
Suffering is not pain.
There is pain without suffering, but they cannot be suffering without pain.
If you remove your attitude of denial, and trying to get rid of the pain, you won't suffer.
If you remove your attitude of indulgence in regard to the pleasure, you won't suffer.
You won't suffer on account of either pleasure or pain or neutral feeling.

**TT**: The more you do that...

**AN**: This attitude is maintained through not knowing it, through gratuitously assuming it at face value.

**TT** You have to know that.
You have to know.

**AN**: Exactly, that's all you can do.
You can't decide to stop.
"Okay, now I will stop trying to get rid of the feeling of unpleasure."
That's impossible.
Through understanding your attitude towards it, that attitude is being gradually cancelled out.

**TT**: I feel pain.

**AN**: I feel pain.
Mind jumps to blame the circumstances.
You recognize that.
"Wait a minute."
How many times has this happened?
How many times will it happen?
Do I have a say in circumstances?
No.
Why do I then keep inflaming myself with this attitude of, "yeah, this or this or that person?"
It just feeds the fire further, while I kind of know already that that's not the problem.
That's why indignation and anger needs constant maintenance---needs constant action to make it valid.
Constant blame.
Find the scapegoat for this.
"Its his fault."
"Its thier fault."
"Who's going to pay for this?"
There are mistakes, and people do things that are unwise, and they are responsible for that.
But, if you suffer on account of it, that responsibility is solely yours.

**TT**: Say the body has a sickness, that kind of pain?
You have to sort yourself out.
Take some medicine.

**AN**: Yeah, that's all fine.
You can be managing the circumstances.
But, you don't want to be doing it out of trying to get rid of the suffering, because that requires you identifying suffering with disagreeable circumstances of an ailing body.
How do you know whether you're acting out of it or not?
Ask yourself, "what if I don't take the medicine?"
"What if I don't go and see the doctor?"
"Am I going to get filled with anxiety and fear in regard to this?"
"Am I going to suffer?"
"Am I going to experience mental anguish?"
If the answer is yes, it means you are still conflating suffering with circumstances. 

**TT**: But, you can't just give up the medicines?

**AN**: No, no.
Then you realize whether you give up the medicines, or not, that's not the problem.
The problem is you confusing your suffering with disagreeable feeling, that has arisen on the level of an ailing body.
You are making it into your mental anguish, because of the gratuitous attitude of trying to get rid of it.
Then you can take a step further and reflect, "okay, so this is the work that needs to be done in order to do thst work I need to stay alive, so I'll take the medicine."
That is properly reflecting.
Then you take the medicine, as in borrowing the time, so that you can uproot the problem.
But, you don't take the medicine out of that blind sort of just jump into it.
"I'm sick--fear--deal with it---Okay, now I'll practice."

**TT**: You've got to look after your tools.

**AN**: Yeah, of course, exactly.
The body is a tool on account of which you can understand the nature of the body---the nature of non-ownership, and so on.
And for that, you need it.

**TT**: Keep it in a suitable...

**AN**: That is what the Buddha would say, "he wisely avoids a wild elephant, the one who practices dhamma, he wisely avoids a snake, a charcoal pit, a wild pack of dogs", because he would be foolish, before he has completed the work, to ignore the fact that this might kill him.
You don't go around with an attitude of health is good in itself, as in the health is the greatest value.
You're going to be sorely disappointed.
Health is a tool.
Then you realize, "okay, my health's not perfect, but the tool is still good enough."
You can also then realize that you're able to go quite far with the attitude of it's good enough, because it is good enough.
It comes down to well as long as I'm still alive, and my senses are still there, it's still good enough, even if you are in pain and discomfort.

**TT**: You don't have to go and seek out intense feelings.

**AN**: No, absolutely not.
Of course not.

**TT**: To change my attitude.

**AN**: Why would you do that?
If somebody has that thought, where would that action---intention---be rooted?

**TT**: Fear of suffering.

**AN**: Right there and then.
So, you realize, I don't need to go out, because I just now reveal to myself that I'm trying to get rid of the suffering by thinking I'll go out and do this and this.
That's where you get rid of the suffering, where you recognize your attitude in regard to the disagreeable feeling.

**TT**: There's a feeling always present, so the work is always present.

**AN**: The work is always present, in the sense of being mindful of the attitude towards the present feeling.
In order to be mindful of the present feeling, you have to stop blaming the circumstances for the arising of that feeling.
You have to take responsibility for it.
You have to feel it.
You have to allow it to be felt, but not try to get rid of it.

**TT**: Mindful of the craving---the attitude.

**AN**: You can't be mindful of the craving, as in, "I'm craving and craving and craving".
You can be mindful of the feeling, and then discern the nature of it.
As I said, "my attitude is always second to this".
It's inconceivable to be different.
Once that which you have been prioritizing is seen as second, it's not a priority anymore.
If that attitude is not a priority, that's how the attitude starts to fade.
Through being mindful of the enduring feeling, you get to discern the nature of the feeling.
That's why mindfulness is the basis of knowledge.
Or like pain of restraint---saying no to yourself---saying no to sensual indulgence---saying no to laziness---saying no to ill will---not acting out of ill will---it produces pain, because there's that discrepancy of "I want to do this", but you say "no".
Again, where is that discrepancy really rooted?
Is it rooted in wanting this, and saying no to it?
Or is it rooted in not wanting the disagreeable feeling of wanting this, and saying no to it?
Circumstances arising, like a prospect of ill will, but you restrain yourself; as a result of that, you're experiencing this pain now, unpleasant feeling.
That's what you're resisting.
Circumstances were not a problem.
Even wanting to act out of it wasn't a problem.
It became a problem when circumstances that were unpleasant, and you wanted to get rid of the displeasure through effecting the circumstances.
That's why you go and shout, beat people up, and threaten them, so they never ever say that to you again.
If you were not affected by the feeling of what's being said, how could you even conceive an act of ill will?
It is the same for sensuality as well.
The first relationship with sensual prospect of every mind---that's universal---is pain.
That's why sensuality is so intoxicating, because it's felt very unpleasantly, and if you give into it---not just that you cover up that pain---but you get more pleasure out of it, so it feels like a double pleasure.
You realize that sensuality is maintained.
People go with "I'll follow the tastes or sexuality" or just just careless indulgence of the senses, because it's very painful when the prospect of sensual indulgence presents itself.
It's felt very painfully to not give in, and automatically you blame your attitude of not giving in for the pain.
But you realize, "wait a minute, my attitude is a negative attitude---I'm not doing anything".

**TT**: Negative attitude?

**AN**: Negative attitude means sensuality has arisen, "hey, go and eat all these cakes that you want now."
That's a thought.
You're not actually eating the cakes, which means you're still not doing anything, so your response is a negative response.

**TT**: Not a bad response.

**AN**: Not a bad response in a negative like, "oh, it's bad."
No, it means it's not a positive action.
It's a call to a positive action.
"Go and get these cakes and eat them and enjoy the sense of taste you get from it."
Now, all of that is still your thought, and you're not eating it.
You're not making any effort.
It's a negative experience.
It's absence of these cakes.
They will provide me with these great pleasures.
And that's the pain of it.
It's because of your attitude that always welcomes greater pleasure from the currently experienced feeling.
The prospect of greater pleasure immediately is experienced as that great discrepancy.
Then people would give in, go and get all these cakes, and overeat and whatnot, because they want to avoid the pain in the first place.
Can you really prevent the pain, in the first place, by doing that?
Or can you just cover it up and distract yourself from it?
You realize you can't avoid it.
You realize by giving into---giving value to---the joy that comes out of taste, confirms that you were affected by it in the first place---by that pain of not fulfilling that sensuality.
As we said before, people think sensuality is unpleasant, because they say no to it, but it's other way around.
By saying no to sensuality, you feel the pain that you have attributed to saying no---attributed to not giving into the positive action.
The pain of it is in that positive action.
If you want to get rid of sensuality---the pain, the dependence, the pressure, the burden, and all of it---you just need to stick to saying no to it.
Then the nature of it will become apparent, because you're not doing anything.
You're not doing anything, but the thought of sensuality comes.
Restraint is closer to the natural state you were in before.
You were not doing anything.
It is the thought of sensuality that pressures you to go and do it, and the pain arises on account of that.
That's the discrepancy that's been created.
You were not doing anything before sensuality, and you're not doing anything when you're restraining sensuality, so that's the constant there.
What has changed is absence of sensuality before the pain, and then presence of sensuality when the pain is there.
You realize it's the presence or absence of sensuality; craving for that pleasure is what creates the discrepancy of pain---of suffering---on account of sensuality.
Not my restraint.
My restraint is more like emulation of the proper behavior, of the proper action, of the action that doesn't give in to the pressure of sensuality, or the or ill will, and so on.
That's why the restraint, self-composure, and virtue has to come first, because it starts emulating things rightly.
You don't know it yet, but on that ground you can get to know it.
Inevitably pain is going to be felt when you say no to sensuality, and you have to accept it.
Once you accept it, then you can say to the pain, and to yourself, that that pain belongs to the sensuality---not to the restraint of it.
As I said restraint, that negative, there is no action there.
It's abstaining from action.
You've been abstaining from sensual action when there was no sensuality pressuring you.
Now sensuality is pressuring you.
You're practicing restraint.
Again, you're on the same level of abstaining from that action.
Yet there is pain.
What's different?
It's absence or presence of sensuality.
Then it becomes even more apparent.
One thing for sure, you'll never find peace---and ultimate freedom---as in not being pressured by circumstances, if you keep engaging with sensuality---with gratuitous cravings of pleasure through senses---with gratuitous expressions of your ill will through your senses.
Whether sensuality touches you, whether ill will touches you, whether boredom touches you, what do they all have common?
Pain.
It's a disagreeable experience.
Having an attitude of wanting to get rid of disagreeable, means what?
In sensuality, how do you get rid of disagreeable?
By saying yes to it.
In ill will, how do you get rid of the disagreeable?
By affecting the person or whatever circumstances.

**TT**: By saying yes to it.

**AN**: By saying yes to it, exactly.
In boredom, how do you get rid of disagreeable?
By saying yes to it, and finding things to distract yourself from it.
Either way, you have a positive attitude that result in positive actions of indulgence, ill will, distraction---greed, aversion, delusion---not metaphysical things.
They're things that your attitudes are based on, your actions are based on, because of your attitude in regard to how you're feeling.
From that point of view, that's what the Buddha meant, "whatever it's felt counts as suffering", because feeling of agreeable pressures you, feeling of disagreeable pressures you, feeling of neutral pressures you.
Again, that pressure is not in the feeling or on the feeling, that pressure is in your ignorance of it.
You are pressured in regard to pleasure, because you haven't understood it.
You are pressured in regard to displeasure, because you haven't understood it.
Same goes for the neutral feeling.
And that's exactly what the Buddha said, "if the neutral feeling is not understood, it's felt unpleasantly".
Pressure is there.
If the neutral feeling is understood, there is no pressure, and it's felt pleasantly.
You want sensuality in order to be free from pain.
You have ill will and anger in order to be free from pain.
You have distraction, boredom, indolence, laziness in order to be free from pain.
Wanting to be free from pain.
If you stop equating that with trying to get rid of this pain, then you can actually learn how to free yourself from pain---from being affected by pain.
You will truly be free from pain, not when pain stops arising, but when your attitude towards pain changes.

To add to what you said, you don't have to go out seeking out suffering and pain.
Just say no to your desires, and the pain is there.
You don't need to go and risk your life, feel threatened, and get that existential dread going.
Just start saying no to your daily sense desires, and you'll see how quickly the pain will come knocking on your door.
If the attitude is developed towards pain is not a problem, it's my attitude towards pain that's a problem, then no amount of pain can prevail over the mind.
That's what the Buddha meant for an arahant, "the disagreeable feelings cannot overwhelm his mind. He is the one who overwhelms, his mind overwhelms the disagreeable feelings."
Or he is the one who overwhelms his mind in regard to disagreeable feelings.
It is not that he needs to do that.
It's not like there's some sort of determination---willpower practice.
No, through understanding, that's just the natural state of affairs.
When disagreeable arises, it has arisen overwhelmed by the mind that has understood it.
Understanding overwhelms the disagreeable.
Presence of understanding automatically is higher than disagreeable, or agreeable, or neutral.
None of those feelings can overwhelm it anymore.
It's not on the level of I'm doing this.
It's on the level of simultaneously understanding the pain and the pain that is there.

**TT**: Understanding.

**AN**: You understand what's there.
That understanding depends on what's there.
Whenever that thing is there, it has been understood right there and then, because it's there.
Not because you theorize about it, and rationalize about it.
No, it's because it's there, that's what's been understood.
Presence of that thing, presence of agreeable feeling, presence of disagreeable feeling.
That is just another way of saying there is no more attitude.
There is no more assumed, almost entitled, attitude in regard to pleasure, pain, or neutral.
Pleasure feels pleasantly, displeasure feels unpleasantly, and neutral feelings need feels neutrally, and there is no suffering in regard to any.

We started by saying, why is pain a problem?
Why am I making a problem out of pain?
Same.
Why am I making a problem out of pleasure?
"Well, I'm not making a problem."
Well you are, because you are pressured by it.
If pleasure is truly not a problem, you wouldn't suffer on a kind of not getting enough of it.
Whichever shape or form pleasure would arise, it would be self-sufficient to that extent.
It means there would be no craving for more sensual pleasure.
You have a thought of going and eating up all the nice sweet cakes.
That thought is agreeable.
It's nice cakes, nice taste, but that's it.
In itself, that's sufficient.
Why would not that thought pressure you to go and make all these actions of finding cake, getting cake, eating cake, consuming cake, all of that?
That means you were affected by that pleasure on the level of your thought.
Because you were affected, the only means of you dealing with being pressured and experiencing disagreeable is seeking out what it sort of points at, at the cake, at the mouth and eating, at shoving cake in your mouth, all that.
All that is secondary to the thought of that pleasure of the taste.
If you were indifferent to the pleasure of the taste on the level of the thought, committing actions on account of it becomes inconceivable.
That doesn't mean that you don't recognize this is a tasty cake, and this is not a tasty food.
None of that experience can then facilitate further actions for its own sake.
That's why sensual craving and sensual pleasure always remains bound with the level of the thought.
The only reason you'll be going there, doing this, and eating it, is because the context of the thought of consuming a tasty food is still there---giving the meaning to all of your individual actions of getting there.
That's why once you go and eat the cake, you never can fulfill that thought.
Because thought is a thought, and taste is a taste.
It's a completely different sense.
You were assuming this identity of the whole projection---the whole action---the thoughts of a pleasant taste and consumption of the pleasant taste being identical.
But it isn't, and deep down you know that, and it is obvious to everyone.
Everybody will say, people who never read Buddhism, "yeah, you know, can't really satisfy your desires, can you?", because there's nothing to satisfy.
There was a pleasure, initial pleasure, on the level of the thought.
That's it.
It's your attitude that automatically wants more pleasure, so you think more about it.
That wants more pleasure so you go and do something about it.
Again, it's the attitude of wanting more pleasure in regard to the thought of pleasure.
That's the discrepancy that's been created there.
That attitude is why you suffer.
That attitude is why you assume the whole world of sensuality.
If you undo the attitude of automatically wanting pleasure, and automatically not wanting pain, then when you have an agreeable thought of tasty food---or agreeable thought of beautiful music, or agreeable thought of beautiful sights---that's it.
They're just beautiful things that you thought about.
That agreeability of them stays with them.
There is no attitude of you, I want more of this.
That's why in the thought, there will be only the thought.
In the sight, they will be only the sight.
You hear something pleasant.
That pleasure is confined to that pleasure, because you don't interfere with it through your attitude of wanting more of it.
You don't interfere with it through your attitude of trying to get rid of it.
In the seen, there will be just been the seen
In the heard, there will just be the heard.
The Bāhiya Sutta, the famous Bāhiya Sutta.
Not because you got so absorbed in the seen that there's only the seen.
No, it's because in the seen, there can only be the seen.
You can't have the something else in the seen.
No, if it's there, it's seen.

**TT**: You can't have the heard.

**AN**: You can't have the heard in the seen, or the thought in the seen.
In as much you can't have the seen in the thought.
And that's what I'm saying here.
That's why sensuality is on the level of the mind.
And that's what the Buddha said, "even for the Tathāgata, the beautiful things remain in the world."
It's the desire and lust---his thought, desire and lust that's been perpetuated through it---is what he has uprooted.
A thought of sensual pleasure is agreeable on the level of the thought, and you recognize that is the extent of his gratification, that initial agreeability.
That's as much as you can get from him.
If you remove the attitude of its wanting more of it, you remove any basis for spreading of sensuality.
If there is no spreading of sensuality, sensuality will cease, because it requires maintenance.
Avijjā requires maintenance.
Ignorance requires maintenance.

Ill will---the thought of, "I've been offended", "he said something rude to me", or "all these people might come and kill me".
If you're not trying to get rid of the displeasure of that thought, you won't be affected by anything that happens through that thought, and you certainly won't be able to engage with anything and wholesome.
That's why you wouldn't be able to kill somebody, even in self-defense.
You just wouldn't.
There's nothing to defend.

Why is pain not wanted, and why is pleasure wanted?
It's not about getting rid of the pleasure or having more of it.
It's not about getting rid of the pain making it never appear.
It's about not wanting one and not trying to get rid of the other.
That's it.
Now you can't say, you have a thought of eating some tasty food, and then you're full on chugging food down your throat---just swallowing it---and saying to yourself, "but see, I don't want it on the level of my thought".
That's inconceivable.
That's a contradiction in terms.
That's why the Buddha said it's impossible to engage physically with sensuality without having sensual perceptions on the level of thought.
You just can't.
Hence, the sense restraint---the physical restraint---needs to come first, because it's based on that discrepancy.
To engage in with it, you're affirming the discrepancy.
If you're affirming the discrepancy, you're affirming suffering.
How can you get rid of suffering when you're affirming it through your own very actions?

**TT**: You're building up on suffering.
You take suffering as your temptation.

**AN**: Yeah, exactly, which means any of your efforts cannot really pertain to suffering---to the undoing of it.

**TT**: By trying to cover it up.

**AN**: Trying to get rid of it.
By trying to get rid of it is perpetuation of the attitude that creates the problem.
That's what I  meant, your attitude creates the problem, and the problem perpetuates it, once created.
There is no first point where that problem was created and wasn't before.
There's no first point to avijjā.
Or you can just think about pain as we started.
If you remove the attitude of not wanting pain, you're automatically dealing with sensuality, with pleasure, and with pain, and with ill will---because, you would give in to sensuality, because it's unpleasant to not do so.
The way of getting rid of that displeasure is by doing so.
But, what if you're not affected by that displeasure in the first place?
Then you realize, "oh, there's nothing for me to get rid of. There's nothing for me to get engaged with." 
Sensuality is pleasant once you're given in to it, but you want to look to why you give in to it.

**TT**: Because it was painful.

**AN**: Because it was painful.
And everybody knows that.
That's where you should use willpower.
It's not saying no to everything---overcoming and prevailing over every single thing.
No.
Just find things on account of which you suffer, which is your attitude in regard to pleasure, your attitude in regard to pain, and your attitude in regard to neither pleasure nor pain.
Prevail there.
That's it.
You don't have to worry about anything else then, because whatever you do won't be unwholesome, because it's not rooted in trying to get rid of pain.
It's not rooted in the discrepancy.
Hence, it's our own ignorance---and our own actions rooted in it, that are perpetuating it---that is obscuring the nature of things as they actually are.
Remove your discrepant attitude---or the attitude that results in discrepancy,
that creates it, that generates it---then you see the way things are.
In the seen, there is just the seen.
There never was anything more.
There couldn't have been anything more.
In the felt, there was just the felt.
In the perceived, there was the perceived.
In the intended, there was the intended.
Nothing else.
In the world, there was just the world.

In that sense, you can truly learn from your pain, whatever that pain is---not through psychologizing and developing pleasing theories.
No.
With presence of pain you automatically and simultaneously must have presence of that gratuitous attitude, unless you're fully enlightened.
Through the presence of disagreeable, you have a basis for undoing your attitude towards the disagreeable.
Pain is a great teacher, if done rightly, if you know how to look at it.
If you have a right view.
If you know where to look, then all you have to do is practice composure, self-control, restraint, because all these things will be revealing the nature of
feelings that are experienced unpleasantly.
It will be revealing the displeasure of sensuality---the displeasure of ill will.
It will be revealing it, not creating it.
Once you reveal the displeasure that was making you have the attitude towards getting rid of the displeasure, you start to undo the attitude automatically.

**TT**: That work can be in front of you always.

**AN**: Yeah, yeah sure, sure.
It is always, because it's always something felt, which means there's always attitude in regard to whatever's being felt.

**TT**: That's the only work that needs to be done.

**AN**: That's the only work.
That's the work on the most fundamental level.
If you fix things on the most fundamental level, everything else built on top of it will be fixed equally.
If you purify the stream at its very origin, the top of the mountain, eventually even the rivers and seas that are being filled by that stream will be purified.
But you can battle trying to purify the rivers down the mountain, while the source of pollution remains.
When the Buddha says he purifies his mind from unwholesome thoughts---from thoughts of sensuality---that's exactly how it's done.
Not by chasing every individual thought, "I was thinking this", "what does it mean?"
No.
What is the nature of this?
Was it rooted in trying to get rid of the pain caused by a prospect of sensual pleasure?
Was it rooted in trying to get rid of the pain caused by something disagreeable?
Was it trying to get rid of the pain caused by something agreeable?
Was it trying to get rid of the pain caused by neutral?
Either way, it's going to be either sensuality, ill will or delusion, so he didn't entertain it on that level.
That is how he purified his behavior in every other regard.
