**Speaker1**: Um, so my first question was actually, you spoke about it in the last video, as it happens, was related to what you mean by delighting in sensuality.
But you did speak about it in the last video, and it was quite clear when you said that it's kind of in that attitude of anticipation, an initial attitude of anticipation, or background attitude of anticipation towards a particular experience or something.
And then I think the question that I wanted to just to make sure that just to clarify it is, what would be the difference between delighting in a sensual thought of sensual nature and engaging mentally in sensuality?
Is there a difference between those two things?

**Ajahn Nyanamoli**: Well, yes, but they're not on the same level. If you were not delighting, you wouldn't be able to engage mentally.

**S1**: Yes.

**AN**: So delight is the basis for mental engagement. So you can then not engage mentally, but still delight.
But if you don't delight, even thinking about the sense objects its not sensuality, because there's no delight.

**S1**: Okay, that's good, that's kind of what I thought. The delight is more like the necessary condition for you to be able to engage in a thought of sensual nature in a sense that's...

**AN**: To welcome it, to delight in it.
Accept the joys, the promises, and so on.
Basically to take it for granted.

**S1**: And so even if you're just sitting and not even moving or doing anything, there is a difference between having an attitude of wanting to go towards something, welcoming it and delighting it.
And then you can then even actively, then there is this active thinking about something, of whatever pleasant experience, that you want to have or something that you can actively be thinking about it.
But before that, there has to be already, or prior, let's say, underlying it, there is that attitude.

**AN**: Yeah, which remains there. It gives you the meaning, gives the context of what your mind is revolving around.
And that's why, that's why a lot of people would more often than often meditate with sensuality. I mean, suttas say the same.
And the point is exactly that, so you might be saying no to the sensual objects, so you're not engaging with them.
You're refusing to think about them, you're concentrating away from them, you're getting rid of those thoughts.
But is your mind still expecting pleasure, delight in joyful ideas of whatever meditation experience and so on, and say, yes, so that's, that is your intention, that is your context, that is your motivation.
So when you sit to meditate, to sit to meditate in a way of discerning the enduring body there, the basis for the subjected to do all these reflections,
or you sit to meditate to constantly evoke, to get, to produce the experience of pleasing kind. And then that's just exactly the same sensual principle.

**S1**: Okay, yeah.

**AN**: That's in that sense, like even people would take on the sīla and the virtue, but in that kind of a conditional way.
They would take it because yes, they were told they need to take it in order to get this special experience of meditation and enlightenment.
But if you're actually, if your meditation is on the level of reviewing your situation, the body, the context, the danger, the peril, the disenchantment, that is better to give it up, then you realize, oh no, sīla and virtue is what protects me from falling deeper into this. It's not conditional anymore.
It's seen directly for what it is, abstaining from certain acts is what created this context of recognizing the trap, the bait, and everything else.

**S1**: That brings me to another, yeah, that's exactly the other thing I wanted to ask about or check.
Is that this, it seems that the danger in relation to sensuality, but again, I have another come back to that in a minute.
Or even the whole domain of the senses and engagement into the senses involved with the senses, because there's, let's say, two broadly speaking aspects of danger that kind of appear more or less clearly to me at different times.
One of which is really in relation to the nature of this particular type of, let's say, you kind of, you can learn to recognize a particular type of, let's say, perception, or if you're in seclusion, there's nothing else, it's more like a thought, type of thought.
It's not about, initially, it will be about certain types of objects, but it's more about the nature of the thought that it contains an invitation or a hook, or it requires you to, it wants you to do something to become involved in a particular type of sense of object, or a particular type of activity or experience in some way.
Like, then in relation to that, there is the danger of, like, the mind becoming disturbed, and you having to kind of hang yourself, you becoming involved, hang yourself on this particular object, or, let's put it like that.
That you become dependent on all of this, this experience, getting something, wanting something, what will happen if we don't get it, what will happen on account of this, becoming busy on account of this, and, yeah, so that's the kind of type of, of danger of, the danger of involvement or being required to do a particular thing.

**AN**: Is there a more, even more immediate type of danger implicit?

**S1**: That's, there is, it seems like a second aspect of danger, which is really more about the fact that the, about the nature of the body, such as the senses, as such.

**AN**: But that nature is there, regardless of whether you're engaged with sensuality or not, so what's dangerous about it?
In one case, why isn't danger is in another case?

**S1**: Yes, because the reason why, yeah, because if, if you can kind of, let's say, you see, you start to recognize that, regardless of...

**AN**: Well, let's say, where does the pain come from, suffering?
What's the origin of suffering?

**S1**: The craving.

**AN**: The craving, yeah. And what is the, where does the craving exist?
Is it a physical thing?

**S1**: No, it's an in your attitude towards things.

**AN**: So it's a mental thing.
Is the mental craving, which any craving is mental, so is the craving a method of choice?
Can you choose the craving, which is not to crave?

**S1**: No.

**AN**: So craving is something the mind does, which means suffering is something that mind causes.
Is the mind something you ask for, something you can control, something you can own, something that obeys you?

**S1**: No.

**AN**: No, kind of, you are aligned with it, so to speak.
It obeys you most of the time, if the circumstances are alright.
But if circumstances change, that's when you realize that mind doesn't actually want to listen to you.
You can't stop it. And then you suffer on account of it.
So then, you want to be free from suffering, means you need to be free from craving, which means you need to teach your mind how to stop doing it.
Or you need to basically understand your mind or surmount your mind.
Either way, mind does the craving.
So how do you then stop that?
And that's where the danger is.
The danger of sensuality is the danger of still, the slight, doesn't matter...
The little bit of sensuality means there is still a little possibility of that mind craving against you.
Against itself, resisting, but eager against anything that that, and you can't control that.
So you cannot, you can have wishful thinking and hope that the mind won't,
because you know, you're so calm and you've been keeping precepts for so long.
Fundamentally, for as long as there is a trace of sensuality,
the other backside of that same trace, same phenomena, same values of sensuality
is the value of the wild mind, which means the craving remains there.
And if you want to see whether your mind still has that uncontrollable threat
that would turn against itself and cause you immense suffering,
if circumstances change, if you lose health, life and so on,
you have just practiced sense restraint and solitude, and you'll see when the mind doesn't get what he wants, it's going to start getting wound up.
And then you will recognize that that's the root of the suffering.
It's the craving.
So I can't stop the craving.
I can't will it away.
I can't just choose it.
But what I can do is tame the mind so it becomes unable to turn against itself.
And that's where it recognizes true danger of sensuality.
So giving in to sensual desire, even on the mental level, valuing it, means allowing mind to remain wild to that extent.
And sooner or later, that will bite you back.
So what I am trying to say is it's not a delayed danger.
It's the other side of the same coin.
And that's that when danger becomes apparent, it means, as we said, this anticipation, this delight, literally this thing while it is present,
the background of it is mind eating itself, the possibility of it.
Won't do it there, but the fact is you're allowing it.
And if you go that way, to that extent, you gave your own mind room to turn against itself.
And then it will.
Sooner or later, it will.
As long as you don't abandon that attitude and that anticipation, and you don't see thoroughly the peril of giving in to that direction.
Once you do, and as the Buddha said, you dry up from sensuality internally, then the mind, the animal will be completely tamed.
It will forget how to turn against itself.
And that's where you recognize that, okay, so now, suffering cannot arise.
Even if the circumstances are completely falling apart around me.
Everything, disintegrating.
What cannot happen is mind turned against itself, because you tamed it.
But you won't tame it for as long as there is, as long as you allow it to eat the bait, or welcome the bait with delight in the bait.
Think about the bait.

**Speaker2**: And the bait we refer to is basically a prospect of pleasure.

**AN**: Sure.
Yeah.
The value of pleasure, delight and pleasure, prospect of pleasure.
So the bait is also, like, it's not prospect of pleasure can show you the bait, but it also simply cannot see the danger enough.
That's also what the bait is.
That's what it means.

**S2**: You are not recognizing the bait.

**AN**: Seeing the danger is how you basically stop valuing the pleasure,
and recognize the bait.

**S2**:The bait is the bait.

**AN**: Yeah, the bait is the bait.
So it's not, well, I'm trying to say, it's not like that you don't need to actively seek out, and then, oh, I don't actively seek out, thus I'm free from bait.
No, do you now, by OK, you don't actively seek out, but do you now see the danger if you were to seek out?
And if you don't see the danger, to that extent, yeah, you still don't see the bait.
You don't see the bait.
You don't see the danger.

**S2**: Yeah, exactly.
And when the bait, or when this prospect is seen as the bait,
as something that will hook me, then delight decreases.

**AN**: Well, no, when the prospect of that anticipation
is seen, this thing is what makes mind bite itself.

**S1**: Exactly.
That's what I meant.
Yeah.

**AN**: That's when you know there's nothing, no pleasure in the world, that would make you accept it.

**S1**: Yeah.
Because it's not that it's that like they...

**AN**: It's nothing to do with the thing you want.

**S1**:It's nothing.
It's that like...

**AN**: Giving it to that, or maintaining that, or not seeing the danger
that it perpetuates, enables the mind, and it perpetuates that enabling of mind to bite itself.

**S1**: Yeah.

**AN**: When things change, when you paired with what you don't want, separate it from what you want, you know, the five cords of sensual pleasure and so on, and you know that, you know that.
You will not be able to stop it.
You can just hope and ignore it, but factually, if there is a room for a mind to bite itself, it will.
Because you allowed it.
And that's the danger.
So, yes, you can involve the future peril, and dissatisfaction, sure, to reign it in, but fundamentally, accepting this means mind biting itself.

**S1**: Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's exactly what I meant.
It's so nice to...
Matches.
Yeah, like the danger is in that any kind of...
That's what you just said.
I'm not going to repeat it, but that is the danger.
It's nothing to do with what will happen in the future, what could happen in the future, or whatever, because, yeah, that's like, oh, it could not happen, or it could be fine, or whatever.
But it's just that fact of being hooked, like having this...
Yeah, having a hook, having a push, having any kind of craving is in itself to be not desired, to be not welcomed.
Because it's the way...
It's like the gateway to hell, really.

**AN**: Yeah.

**S1**: It's...

**AN**:Yeah.
Yeah, this great mass of suffering, as the Buddha described.

**S1**: Yeah.
That's the great way to...

**AN**: That craving, that's it.
Because of that, the great mass of suffering, and the great mass of suffering, is always on the count of the same cause.

**S1**: The same core.

**AN**: The presence of craving.
Yeah, that is...
Everything else is second to it.
And as we describe, presence of craving, full stop is something that the mind that hasn't been tamed will do.
When faced with a agreeable, disagreeable or neutral, which means the great mass of suffering remains something that you are under.
So you are liable to it, you will be subjected to it.
But, if the danger of sensuality has been understood, i.e.
Oh, okay, so, without...
If I don't give in to this, if I don't welcome this, because now I see, if I do, this is the result.
The result is, mind remaining able to eat itself, if it wants to.
In a split second, not like, you know, it will not be a long process.
All you need to do is face with something you don't want to face with, and all the dread and pain and everything will be instantaneously there.
Because the mind will just try to turn away from it.
To resisted it.
Because again, you let it, you gave it room to do so.
And that's why it's...
It's hard to see, because, you know, room to do so, doesn't mean the mind is doing it all the time.
So, you then forget that the mind can still do it.
It can still turn against itself.
It can still want to deny its own existence, out of pain and aversion and hatred
and ill will and so on.
But because it's not doing that all the time, you sort of forget that there is room for it to still turn around and sink its teeth.
Yeah.
So, that's the danger.

**S1**:Yeah.
And that was something...
That was another point, that's...
That's why...
Like, it's not...
Being like having a kind of a sense of safety or something is not about just currently not feeling any sort of pressure of the sensual kind, because you can have that, even for quite a long time, for example.

**AN**: Sure.

**S1**: But as soon as something comes up, something arises,
if at that moment, then you will be going in that direction, not able to see the problem in it and not recognizing it for what it is.
Then there is no safety, really, at all.
So, it's...

**AN**: So, where is the safety then? The true safety?

**S1**: Then the safety is when you know where the danger is, then you know that no matter when it will...

**AN**: So, you know now that the danger is in mind being able to turn against itself.
So, what is then the safety?

**S1**: Well, if you see the danger of that, then the...
If the mind is able to turn itself against itself, what makes the mind being able to turn itself against itself?
That's something that you are responsible for, but you can't choose to not do.
So, if you recognize the danger of doing that, which makes the mind able to turn against itself, then you can not do that.

**AN**: Yeah, and then eventually, the mind will cease to be able to turn against itself.

**S1**: Yeah.

**AN**: And then that's true safety.
You can't suffer.
Craving cannot arise.

**S1**: Yeah, so you said that now, like recognizing where the danger is,
is the necessary condition for safety.
And then is there...
But is there, yeah, is there also a sense that they kind of...
I think it's something slightly different.
Let's say from the perspective of not having any safety, there is...
If you're still in the domain of sensuality and kind of involved in it,
I kind of don't see how it's possible in a way to see the danger in it.
It kind of requires at least say, maybe not the complete sense of safety, but at least a pretty complete seclusion from that domain in order to then have the perspective of...

**AN**: That's why sense restrain, guarding with the sense doors is a prerequisite that's not really optional.

**S1**: Yeah.

**AN**: It needs to be your lifestyle, your mode of being.

**S1**: Complete.

**AN**: Yeah, of course.
In itself, you will still not see where the danger is and so on.
But for sure, if you're not withdrawn, then you're removing the possibility of seeing it.
And it's like we said before, like lighting the fire.
So the Buddha said you know the sticks are in the water, wet.
You take them out of the water first.
Like, if you try to light the fire with sticks in the water, that's just not going to work.
So you take them out, but they're still wet.
So although, yes, they are out of the water.
They're still wet, so they still won't light the fire.
But now at least there is a possibility of them drying.
If you don't put them back in the water.
And while they're dry, thoroughly, then you can light the fire.
And that's it.
 The mind is first physically withdrawn from sensuality, through behavior you withdraw it by not giving into this behavior, because you recognize on it, no.
Like on faith to the degree, but at the same time, you do recognize, I've been going down the direction of the senses, my whole life.
And look, I want to practice.
I want to be free from suffering, because this is what it resulted in.
So then you found the Buddhist teaching, you have a degree of faith, you start applying it.
And you can even intellectually make sense that actually it's better if I'm out of the water.
Even if I don't necessarily see the immediate imminent danger, the direct insigh into freedom from sensuality and so on.
Well, at least I have the possibility to do so, if I stay out of the water.
Yeah.

**S1**: And like that.

**AN**: But in and of itself, that's not a goal.

**S1**: Yeah, exactly.

**AN**: The goal is to light the fire, and you don't forget that.

**S1**: Yeah.
And again, just to clarify slightly further, that being out of the water,
because this could be maybe understood in different ways, as far as I can see,
it really has to become quite complete seclusion, as in it wouldn't really be, because yeah, it can be kind of more or less restrained and keeping the virtue.
But if you are still like busy doing various things...

**AN**: Distracting yourself.

**S1**: And kind of distracting yourself in any way, really, then you kind of can't really even see the which type of is the...

**AN**: Yeah, well that's like seeing the danger in the slightest fault does not mean seeing the danger in the slightest fault of the letter,
and the semantics of the rule, means the danger of the slightest fault
of, okay, so yes, I'm not breaking this...
I'm not giving it to desire by body, but to this course extent, that I'm still looking forward to anything things that are allowable, as we said before.
Also, I'm gonna stop eating, you must stop eating with that desire.
You can't stop eating.
That's the point.
But if a person never recognized that that's where the true danger and the fault is, and still remain on the level of, you know, or I studied all the dictionary, and I got the definition of the rule, and this is what objectively means, and our fault in regard to that interpretation is what I didn't even fault.
I just need to fix the circumstances and make everybody else obey it.
That's not seeing the fault.
That's not allowing, basically, vinaya and sense restraint to make your practice on the level of the mind.
That is just using it to protect yourself through that magical belief that that's where the purity is.
So, in order to abandon sīlabbataparāmāsa, you to refernce where the fault is,
and it's not in the letter, it's not in the definition, it's in like, why am I doing this?
So, you'll find something that's not against the rules, but that still doesn't absolve you from needing to know and feel the weight of why you're doing it.
Yes, coffee is allowable to have in the afternoon, and I can have sugar.
But why?
Why am I doing this?
Where is this rooted?
Oh, yeah, it's been, you know, traditionally offered, touched, you know, with a bowing, triple bowing on a tray.
So, it's just the purest offering, I can imagine, in that external form sense.
But, yeah, but that's, that's irrelevant.
The fault is not in how it was done and presented.
The fault is why am I doing this?
Do I need it?
What for?
Where is this rooted?
And then same would come to exactly like, oh, yeah, so, you know, we are allowed to work and do these things, and like, but why?

**S1**: Yeah, like when studying, it can be done alone..

**AN**: Yeah exactly.
Self study, why am I reading the suttas?

**AN**: These duties that you perceive are kind of self-evident and objectively valid.
That's not where the validity is determined.
It's determined by your intentions and the reasons why you do it.
So, yes, obvious things out of greed, aversion, delusion, eight precepts basically
are not to be broken.
But now all the other permutations doesn't mean you can dismiss them.
Quite the opposite.
Means you need to take more of them just on the right level.
Less specifically, but more because you're taking responsibility for where the actual fault is.
The mind of desire, mind of aversion, and mind of distraction.
But if we judge what needs to be done on the base of authority of the texts, which is again a contradiction in terms, like, you will always have your interpretation of it.
There is no such thing as objective meaning of the text.
It's what it means to you and to us.
And vast majority of people might agree upon the meaning, but every single one of them is individually subjective and responsible for that meaning.
So, the weight of the tradition, the authority, and so on, that's not where these things are.
But if you never abandon that, out of fear of doubt and so on, well, you never allow your mind to recognize where the true fault is and thus uproot it,
out of fear and doubt.
So, that's what I mean like, you need to get out of the water for the sake of drying the sticks, not for the sake of drying out the water and then just, you know, defining what the water was and how you dry and, you know, what you must, what you can, what you cannot do.
From the point of view of desire, you can't do anything.
In or out of water, it doesn't matter.
If the lighting the fire is your goal.
If not, you know, if just living in a spiritual community that agrees upon certain terms and interpretations, is your goal then fine.
But that's not what we're talking about.

**S1**: So, just to come back to this, the degree of, let's say, the degree of seclusion.
And it's, I think, in the suttas that sometimes even says like, he goes into physical seclusion and mental seclusion.
Physical or physical withdrawal and mentally secluded.
Or mentally withdrawn.

**AN**: Can you be mentally withdrawn if you're not physically withdrawn?

**S1**: No, you cannot.
So, there's the physical sense of withdrawal but even there, it needs more
than, like, physically being secluded as in a secluded environment or just being restrained.
There is necessity for mental to be mentally withdrawn from even mentally engaging in unwholesome things for which you need to be able to already see how you are mentally engaging with unwholesome things.
In order to then be able to see the danger in doing so, in order to then kind of have any kind of sense of safety.

**AN**: So, in other words, you need to basically want to light the fire.
And in order to do so, you need to abandon things, external things,
avoidance of responsibilities, external authorities, external agreements, as the measure of your safety, purity, practice and defining what you need to do.
You need to abandon your perceived sense of duty.
So, you need to abandon sīlabbataparāmāsa basically.
That's used.
You know, these fetters and all these random things, they serve purpose.
You're fettered willingly by them because they protect you from that which is very displeasing.
The weight of responsibility, the weight of interpretation, the weight of choices and so on.
So, you have a choice to make.
You can remain sheltered, covering things up.
And if you want to uncover it, then you have to unshelter it.
That's what I mean like, the true safety comes from mind being unable
to turn against itself.
But in order to arrive there, you need to stop covering up the fact that the mind can't turn against itself.
Oh, but I'm fine.
You know, I keep the precepts and the pure and the devotional and stuff.
That is all just conditional.
Sure, that's nice in a worldly sense.
But then you need to start asking yourself, why am I doing this?
If I took, oh no, I agree with this, with this tradition of interpretation
or whatever else the way we should do.
Fine, but you still need to know why and take responsibility for it.
It's never on them. It's never on others.
It's never on the, as I've said, on the external world.
Even if you say, yeah, I'll agree to what you already agreed.
That still doesn't absolve me from needing to know why I'm doing that and think for myself and take responsibility for it.
But often that's exactly why it's done.
I will go with majority, with the tradition, with the established voice so I don't have to think for myself.
But you are thinking for yourself, now you're just lying to yourself about it.
Because how would you choose to go with the tradition with established voice
unless you thought about it?
And obviously felt some safety on account of it, and gave into it.
And now you're just saying, no, no, I just go, but I do what others say.
So you do need to take responsibility for it and then it ceases to be on that level.
And then you realize it's all, it is all interpretation.
The eight precepts are interpretation.
Like, yeah, you know, you can bend in this way, bend in that way, sure.
But fundamentally, you realize, okay, you could extrapolate the principle of greed, aversion, delusion, sensual desire, ill will, carelessness, distraction.
That is what needs to be restrained.
How we define it? And can I touch this?
And if it's touch, can I do this?
Well, you know, if I said it, okay, you can go into these details if it's helpful.
But not for the sake of deriving safety from the definition that you read in a book or a senior monk told you.
But simply from knowing more how to recognize the root of the problem in your mind.
So the greed and delusion doesn't hide from you, or did you don't feel absolved from it?

**S2**: So when I recognize that there is nothing I, nothing at all, I have to do.
Or nothing at all that I can do that can absolve me from taking the responsibility for whatever I choose to do.

**AN**: Also, furthure more, on a more immediate level, it will be, if you abandon sīlabbataparāmāsa, it will be like, oh, I don't need to do anything in order to be safe.
And thus I am safe.
So the relief of abandoning the fetters, it's factual.
It's not intellectual.
And it's on exactly that level.
See, it is a burden.
Having to define, having to follow, having to update, having to comply, having to do, having to perform.
All of that is a factual burden.
You don't see the burden in aspect, because you emphasize the sheltering aspect.
Once you stop sheltering, in that aspect, you can actually eventually, if you go into the right direction, abandon the burden of it.
It is no, no, quite the opposite.
If I don't engage that way, I remain safe.
I remain unexposed.

**S2**: So in a way, it's on account of the loss of perspective?

**AN**: I don't understand.

**S2**: Like you said, that you pay more attention in a way to the sheltering aspect, but not to how it affects you.

**AN**: Right, I wouldn't say it's on a kind of loss of perspective, because you never had the perspective.
You start by not having perspective.
So it's on account of the lack of perspective.
Loss would imply you sort of had it and then you lost it.
But, you know, you start already fettered.

**S1**: Yeah.
That's why it's like in a way that like, sīlabbataparāmāsa, for example,
kind of covers up.
That's what it does.
It's what its purpose is really is to make something appear comfortable or feel comfortable.
That isn't comfortable.
And it shouldn't be comfortable.
And as in this...

**AN**: What do you mean?

**S1**: Because the avoiding responsibility for things through having things duties and others depending on other things that you...

**AN**: Right, right, right.

**S1**: It kind of makes this...

**AN**: Yeah, makes it comfortable.
I see what you mean.
It makes it doable, but actually nothing is changed on a fundamental level.

**S1**: No, you are still uncomfortable.

**AN**: You're not closer to lighting the fire.
And so, you shouldn't be comfortable.
You should recognize that there is still plenty of room for mind to turn against itself in many different ways.
But yeah, you will feel absolved from needing to deal with it because, you know, abide under the collective responsibility of majority that we all contributed and all partake.
And I'm safe.
Safety of the group.
Safety of the tribe.

**S1**: It's kind of gone off in a different... a slightly different direction.
I wanted to come back to the...
If it's okay, we're kind of going in different directions.
I wanted to come back to the hindrances.
Um...
Because...
Another question I had, I was...
Because I often...
I realized, basically, that often I would...
Sometimes it's not that clear to me, even what exactly is meant by sensual thought or a...
Like a...
Yeah.
Because sometimes...
I often...
I'm kind of...
I think of it in terms of not necessarily defined by particular...
Yeah, particular objects or having...
Even something necessarily being agreeable in a way.
What I realized that sometimes things that I was thinking of as, like,
yeah, sensuality um...
Because it really pertains to, like, engaging in some kind of experience
or feeling like the need to do something, really.
But it's not really...
It would kind of come down to, I realized, oh, that's more like doubt, or that's more, like, kind of, one other one of the hindrances.

**AN**: They do share the same kind of the same thread of hindrances.
They are bound together.
So, it can be on the level of specific sight, sounds, smell, taste,  touch, or, like, the overall, uh, agreeability of the, of, you know, the experience.
But, uh, it does always imply that that sense of pleasure, which is considered safe, friendly, agreeable to me.
That's when in that sutta the Buddha talks about perfect celibacy.
It starts by, yeah, not having sexual intercourse.
Uh, while he was talking to monks about not having sexual intercourse with women.
They're not touching them;
they're not allowing to be touched;
they're not talking to them;
they're not listening to them talk;
they're not looking at them;
they're not thinking about them;
then not wishing about having a rebirth.
So, it was the extension of the same principle.
So, okay, I might have abandoned any kind of physical, carnal, all these pleasures that would be binding me here.
Oh, but I still hope that this, I will find somewhere else here.
Some new here, where it will be nice and pleasant and safe for me, where pleasures will be accessible.
So, in other words, are you still valuing a situation external to your state of mind here and now?

**S1**: That will provide the ability and pleasure.

**AN**: There is a thread of sensuality, yeah.
And that's what I mean, like, if, same, like whether it's meditation or any other, if you're expecting this thing to come on the level of just this external experience that just happened internally now and everything else, you know, it's the same principle, yeah.

**S1**: Yeah, yeah.
And what kind of...

**AN**: So, you might, you know, sorry, like, you know, you can't, you cannot necessarily tell your mind to immediately stop thinking about those things.
But you can certainly not lose perspective, or learn after not lose perspective, on account of having those thoughts present.

**S1**: Hmm.
Yeah, and the thing that's...

**AN**: And what would be the perspective, by the way?
Let's say, how would you not lose a perspective of the spectrum of sexual intercourse with a, you know, whoever I am attracted to?
Up to the level of wishing heavenly rebirths and the safety of heavens.
What is the...
How would you maintain perspective at any part of that spectrum?
Any thought, whatever it is, what would maintain the perspective of the entire thing?
Of the entire domain?

**S1**: What would maintain the perspective of the...

**AN**: What would make you not lose perspective?
Whether it's a course, carnal, sensual desire, or heavenly...

**S1**: Well, it would be recognizing that danger of that whole...

**AN**: Exactly, exactly. It's the same danger.

**S1**: Yeah, it's the same danger of whether it's...

**AN**: Yes, heavens, you know, it's better.
Factually, sure.
If you have desire to heavens, then having desire to common pleasure here and now, which are far worse, with far worse consequences, unintended consequences.
But fundamentally, if you want to be free from it all, fundamentally, if you don't want to leave the slightest room for your mind to turn against itself, even in hundreds millions of eons of time in the future, it's the same danger.
And then there will be no room for mind.
And then the craving will truly be abandoned.

**S1**: Yeah, yeah.
If the danger is seen there, then it really doesn't matter at all, whether there is no kind of even...
Asking, oh, but it's a little or it's bigger, it's smaller or not even...
Whatever way it would never domain, in whatever shape, whatever it's not about, it's like...
And the thing is, as well...

**AN**: And that's what the Buddha would described in the suttas, you know, talk about aggregates and how there's danger in them.
And similarly, he said, it doesn't matter.
whether it's past, future, present, big, small, personal, impersonal, foreign, familiar, nice, light, heavy.
It doesn't matter the property of it, the danger is seen the same.
Not mine, not to be welcomed, not to be delighted in.
And see that long enough, and the mind will calm down.
In other words, the mind will become unable to turn against itself.
Gone, cannot be done anymore.
And that's like the description of the true freedom, the true safety.
It cannot be reverted back, like a stone split in two, leaves, sort of dried up.
It cannot now go back.
So it has completely dried.
Fire has been lit, sticks will burn.
Gone, there are no more sticks to be wet.

**S2**: But then from the perspective of valuing pleasure, that's exactly what a safety is seen.
That's exactly what is seen as safe, basically.
What is...
What is dangerous, so to say.
Like the bait.

**AN**: Sure, sure.

**S1**: Yeah, yeah.

**S2**: The prospect of, oh, let me get this.

**AN**: Yeah, let me have it.
That's my safety.

**S1**: That's my safety.

**AN**: I enjoy the comfort of familiarity, the friendliness of the taste, the bait has.

**S2**: And as we said last time, it does not start when I act.

**AN**: Yeah, exactly.

**S2**: It starts when I...
With the likeness...

**AN**: You're already...
You're already not seeing it as dangerous.
That's where it starts.

**S1**: And that's exactly what the...
Yeah, why?
That's even the danger is in the delights, in towards it.

**AN**: That's the gratification, that's the danger on that level.

**S1**: It's all on that, in that same kernel.

**AN**: It's the same phenomenon.
It's just different aspects of it.
That's what I mean, is the same thing in a way.
So yeah, if you were to not act out of the delights long enough and get to discern the background, not ignore it, you would see that the background over there is the bait.
The delight is the bait.

**S1**: Exactly.

**AN**: The bait is the danger, the delight is the danger.

**S1**:It is the danger.
Exactly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's really...

**AN**: And all the future consequences, it's all because of this.
This is the framework, this is the necessary basis.
This will be there if those consequences we are able to expierce.

**S1**: And yeah, from the perspective of seeing that, then the slightest prospect of going towards that, going in that direction, is very unpleasant, actually.
Or it would be very unpleasant.
It's almost like you're out of prison.
And now you see the prison guard is going, oh, come back in here.
I have some very nice...
I don't know, cake.

**AN**: But the fear would be on the level of, oh, this crazy mind might forget and go back.

**S1**: Yeah, yeah.

**AN**: Like, you know you wouldn't.
But if the mind is still not saying, if it still has room to move, you realize, that's the danger.

**S1**: Yeah.

**AN**: And there was the simile of the charcoal pit.
Yeah, man initially goes willingly there and burns himself with the embers because he perceives it pleasant today.
He gets cured, he doesn't have a need for it.
And if somebody were to pick him up and carry him there, wouldn't he kick and scream, wouldn't he be anywhere else except there?

**S1**: Yeah.
And it's like, yeah.
And you really can see like, oh God, you know, why would anybody want to, like, actually go in that direction when, but you do, that's what I kind of meant.
In a way for that, you do already need the perspective of safe, like some kind of safety.
You can't have that kind of perspective from already being in it and seeing that as the safety.

**AN**: Yeah, if you want to have, like, you know, seeing that principle will be done on different levels, like different layers.
You'll be peeling it more and more.
But yeah, it will be the same thing.
But up until to the point, you realize that if I were to die the next second, will my mind have aversion towards that?
Will it try to sort of, you know, resist it, fight it, deal with it, avoid it, close its eyes, look away.
If so, or if I'm not sure, means there is still room for it to move,
to fight itself.
So that cannot, should not be allowed, if I want to be truly free, secured from bondage.
