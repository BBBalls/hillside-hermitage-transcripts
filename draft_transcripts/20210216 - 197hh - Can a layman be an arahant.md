Thaniyo Thero: So, can a lay lifestyle lead to becoming an arahant?

Ajahn Nyanamoli: A lay lifestyle, no.
No, that's impossible.

The question that's often asked is, "Can a layman be an arahant?"
But that depends what's meant by layman.
If you mean that somebody is not formally ordained, doesn't wear robes, then yes, a layman can become an arahant.
But if by a layman you mean partaking in the lifestyle of a layman, living in company, still having concerns with the world, living a household life, not being sense restrained, that's impossible.
So from that point of view, a layman cannot be an arahant.

It is in the suttas.
A layman, as in a person not ordained in the bhikkhu order, became an arahant.
He wasn't a householder who became an arahant.
He was a person who wasn't ordained, but wasn't living as a householder either.
The most famous case is Bāhiya, who was a woodbark ascetic.
He would just wear woodbark to cover himself, and he was living very austerely, mindfully, and practicing for who knows how long.
He was so pure that he himself thought he's fully enlightened.
Then a deva out of compassion said, "No, actually you are not fully enlightened, go and meet the Buddha."
That is when the famous instruction was give, where all the Buddha needed to say to Bāhiya was, "In the seen, let there just be the seen. In the heard, let there just be the heard," and so on, for all the senses.
And Bāhiya became an arahant.
So technically, Bāhiya was a layman; he wasn't a monk; he wasn't ordained.
Because, then he asked the Buddha, "Oh, can I join your order?"
The Buddha said, "Yeah, go and find a bowl and a robe."
But Bāhiya got killed by a cow.
So technically, he was a layman who became an arahant, but you realize he was far from living a layman's life.
He was basically a type of samaṇa, an ascetic, just not ordained in the order.
And often that's where the lines get blurred.

People say, "Oh, so you don't need to be a monk?"
As in, not needing to be formally ordained to become an arahant means, "I can live a household life, and become an arahant."
No.
You need to live like a monk.
Whether you wear robes, and are ordained formally or not, it doesn't matter.
But, the lifestyle of somebody who has renounced the world, who is sense restrained, matters. 
It is a necessary basis for becoming an arahant.
This constitutes being a samaṇa: sense restraint, celibacy, seclusion --devotion to seclusion as much as possible-- and not being engaged, preoccupied, concerned, inspired by worldly affairs.
You might need to do some worldly things, to some extent -- even as monks you have to.
It is one thing to do it like a chore, and another to do it, because you're still driven by it, you still want it, and you still desire towards it.
That must be abandoned.
So technically, you can live a lay life. But, if you are able to live a lay life, while succeeding at being withdrawn from everything, why don't you just become a monk?
Nothing would stop you from becoming a monk.
Usually when somebody doesn't become a monk, it's because something is still stopping them in the world, which is a form of concern.
And, that concern, itself, is an impediment, if they want to be an arahat.

TT: So one can go forth without ordaining?

AN: Yes, but not because you feel like you've gone forth, but because you actually became sotāpanna or higher.
And that's why the noble ariya saṅgha in the suttas includes laypeople.
They were not monks, but they were actually ariyas.
And consequently one can go forth and ordain and still be a householder in his mind.
So wearing robes is not a guarantee that you are a samaṇa, or that you have that distinction of the noble saṅgha.
