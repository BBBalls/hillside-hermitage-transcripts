00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
I come in question, and I keep hearing you say, why is my existence said to be Dukka?

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Why is my life Dukka?

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
You mean house by the people who don't necessarily would think that that's the case?

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Why is existence? Why is the existence Dukka?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
What is meant by that?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Yes, what is meant by that?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Yes, what is meant by that?

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Probably talked about it before.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
Even if it didn't, it basically comes down to the possibility of suffering.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
And that's it.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
You exist means suffering can touch you.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
That's it, can.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
My non necessarily do so.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
But the fact that it might, that is suffering itself.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
That possibility, if you might suffer at any given time, at any given moment,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
means your existence is suffering.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
That's a very happy life.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Never experience any misfortune.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Nothing like that, which is quite unlikely, but say an ideal case scenario.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
But the fact that at any given moment of your life, you might meet with this more fortunate or anything,

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
that you might find that disagreeable means that possibility, that kind of blooming possibility.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
But the record is that you feel unpleasant in regard to it.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Thus, you feel unpleasant in regard to your existence.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Thus, existence is Dukka.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So it's better not to look at it.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Well, no, that's what most people do.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Because that's just the ignorant default response.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You just don't look at your existence.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
That's why so many people are afraid of boredom.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
But generally, terrified of being bored, terrified of not having anything to do,

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
there's no distraction to keep them floating on the surface.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Why? Because then all these things emerge.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Because they are always there.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
So the only way that you can kind of cope, not resolve an issue by cope,

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
would be to find plentiful distractions, chase your desires like a maniac as much as you can.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
So they keep your gaze diverted from that, which is underneath.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But boredom.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
So there's nothing taking your attention away.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
This weight just kind of shows itself.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
It doesn't come onto you because it's actually always there.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
It just gets revealed again.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
And you can actually, you know, sometimes you have people, no, man,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
there's not my life's good.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Sometimes bad, but generally it's quite annoying.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I disagree with everything in suffering.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Everything is not suffering in terms of everything is miserable.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
But everything can be suffering.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Everything put potentially cause you suffering.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And then it's suffering itself on a very subtle level.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Suffol, but profound.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
It's a subtle, I don't mean like tiny, significant, nst.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
So even those people, just if they were to be locked in for 24 hours or something

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
without any distraction, I think they could have changed their mind.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Except boredom would treat them up.

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
You've been busy with the things that make you kind of give you pleasure.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah, it's like that's an extra drop.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I mean, you're busy for various reasons.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
And they'll kind of merge into this motivation that's rooted in our hearts.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
And also because you've been busy because you basically don't want to look at the problem of your existence.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
So you're finding things to do that you tell yourself are very important and need to be done.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
It's my duty. It's my duty to do this.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
No, you choose your duties.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Literally, and you got to anything and everything.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
So you do things because basically you're running away from looking at your existence.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
So being busy keeps you distracted.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
Then sometimes, well, often, things that you are doing are also providing you with sense pleasure as well.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
So not just that you are distracted initially from the problem,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
but then you also have pleasure on top of that.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
So you can see how it's easily very intoxicating and then people never look back.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
What?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Because there's always something going on.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Until there isn't. Until you get sick. Until you get off.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Until you die.

04:50.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh, it provides the double.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
The distraction and the pleasure.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And then, obviously, it proliferates.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
The more things you do, the more things you create, the more things you do.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Based on things you do.

05:12.000 --> 05:22.000
But the initial motivation of being distracted from the problem of existence,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
that's like a thread that pertains to whatever you do, basically.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
So you do this and then because you do something more, something more, something more, something more.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
And you spend your whole life doing it, but that thread is in common all of it.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
And that's how people, you know, the cases when people have been doing things their whole life,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
working or whatever, and then they get old.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
And then the moment they're not able to physically perform things, the whole life they've been doing,

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
the mind goes, they lose it, they go quickly.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
There's an injury or something, that's it.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Within a week, they're gone, like mentally.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You don't recognize people, nothing.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Because the whole life, it was just depending on that little thing.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And that's inevitable.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
That is inevitable.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
The old age is so hard, you know, in the suitors, they would have worked often.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
And what people would come to with and say, yes, indeed, you know, I remember when I was, you know,

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
I could catch a galloping horse and I was, you know, finding my youth and so on.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
Now, I want to put my foot here, but it goes there, I like that completely.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
And that's so hard because imagine a person who spent their whole life depending on their senses for this distraction.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
There was an underlying pleasure and so on.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
To not look at the existence, that was the sole purpose.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And now the senses fail. Now you can't see.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
You can't hear.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Let alone provide yourself with many full pleasures of sights and so on.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Not just failing.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
Which means that whole, well, that sole motivation for pursuing the senses and the distraction and so on.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
There was provided through that.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
It's just again there. And now there's no escape from it.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
So, all people very often become very unhappy.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
Even if there's nothing necessarily, just unhappiness, miserable, angry, anything.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Just not in a good place.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Because you can't distract yourself anymore.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
Or they try to distract themselves with their family and grandchildren.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
With the joy, the thoughts of my grandchildren.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Because nothing, your senses don't provide you.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You can't even see them. You're blind now. You can't hear them.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
But you think about it.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Which is, like, again, even more perilous position because it's a completely independent people.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
So, when they do something that you do not,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
there's exactly one thing I'm going to bring up now.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
There's, I was looking at some people that I know they have, you know,

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
the father and the mother, their daughter as a child.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
And now the grandparents are obsessed and completely encroached in that grandchild.

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
That little girl, and she's, you know, the center of their universe, the center of their world.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
And just provide a major distraction to, you know,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
everything else is pushed to the side, basically.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
The center of the area is that.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
But all their happiness, and I was looking at some of their photos.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
All their happiness.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
They look very happy and excited.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
The baby is always in the center, literally in the center all the time.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
And you can just see how much their happiness, how much their happiness depends on their child.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
That little girl and the things that could go wrong.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
If something happens that will go.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
She could hurt, she dies, all of a sudden.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
You got, you know, these four people's lives are completely,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
that's done destroyed.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
And they had themselves to plan it.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
The full responsible for placing so much importance on that child.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
And I don't mean, I mean, so much emotional importance for them.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm sure you look after it, of course.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
But placing so much importance for the purpose of distraction and pleasure

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
and not looking at your own existence.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
So then, yeah, when something does happen, it will.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
It's again, in the suitors.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
When the child dies, you know, they found their own streets destroyed.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Where they gone, my son.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah, yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
That's when it, the Buddha says, yeah, suffering, limitation.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It comes from that.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And those who, which idea.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
And they had mad, who suffered because of his son is gone.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
He says, what are you talking about?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
He said, when the Buddha told him that the family and the children are so suffering.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
And the man says, no, no, we're talking about this.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
So it's a pleasure.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And he went to another ascetic and something.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
No, he went to the gamblers on the side of the road.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
The gamblers.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
People were really obviously so good.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Most likely agree with him.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
And they said, no, of course you were right, the Buddha was wrong.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And then the queen reported it to the king.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Well, she had the report to her, then the king said,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
sure, the king, the king heard that.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
And he went to the queen because she was the supporter of the Buddha.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
And he said, see, like I also disagree with the Buddha.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
It is because, look, all these children are so suffering.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And then she went to the Buddha and it would explain.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
And she went to the king and said, do you know your favorite son, your favorite child?

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
If something happens to him right now, like that you can't prevent.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
If he dies for the ill, would you be, of course, of course I would be believing.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I would be destroyed.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, that's how children are so suffering.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Oh.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
And I mean, you know, it sounds obvious.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And it is obvious.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
But that's obvious on the intellectual level.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
But emotionally, that might not mean anything if people are fully attached.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
They'll just ignore the fact because they're already fully dependent upon it.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
No.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
But ultimately, at the end of the day,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
they're trying to become very dying.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
And you can't have them.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
That's why it's not just that it's not a solution.

11:49.000 --> 11:57.000
It's a coping mechanism that basically makes things worse.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Because the worse, the harder you're running away from something,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
that you ultimately cannot escape.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
The harder it will hit you.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
But most people don't know that they're running away.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
They're not intense, you know?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Well, it's an act of bad faith, so they're not fully aware.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
But the reason they're not fully aware is because they don't allow themselves

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
to be fully aware of it.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
They're not fully aware of it.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But that's not exactly.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
That's why bad faith is that it's an unwholesome attitude.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Where basically you convince yourself.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
But in order to convince yourself of such things,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
you need to know what you convince yourself against.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
So they basically threw that bad, threw that running away from their resistance.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
They're carrying that reason for running away.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
So you can't really escape it.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
So you're making it worse because it becomes implied in everything you do.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
And then ultimately, it catches you as you would have always done

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
because it's just...

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And that's why, that's why, for many people,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
centrality and giving up centrality, it's not.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
It's high because it's not just, oh, it's not just that you're giving up

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
pleasures, they come through your senses.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
But then you're giving up the only means of

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
a soul of escape that you know from that weight of your resistance

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
depending kind of looming possibility of suffering.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
You think you're landing on you, crushing you.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
So that's why, for people, centrality, it's not really optional.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I mean, it is optional, not just a matter of choice,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
but it's not just about pleasure.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
It's about having distraction to keep you floating on top of your resistance

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
whereby you won't have to look down below.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
It's just in our space to breathe, but that's about it.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
Beneath us for somebody who's now got the idea

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
and who's looking, oh, my resistance is a problem,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and I'm going to die.

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
I must not practice it, it's a value in awareness.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
Well, then they have to start going against that old grain upstream.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Because, you know, everything, the desire of the senses,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
the running away, everything points down.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
So it's easy to give in.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
So when you recognize that they're just making things worse,

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
now you actually have to stand against that flood

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
and then go the other way.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
So, well, you can imagine how hard that is.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
What do you want them to imagine?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
You're doing it.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
But basically, that's why many people, and again,

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
because you know that deep down, you know,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
that you are running away.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
As I said, because you're carrying those reasons,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
as you're running away, because that's why you're running away.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
When you do, if you do, stop and think about going against the grain,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
then you just feel like, ah, hard and heavy, that will be.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And that flood will most likely take,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
and then you're just carrying on.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Just pretend and just go down with the flow.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
But for someone who's going out, you know,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
like a grand, grand daughter.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
You don't love so much.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
How do they?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Well, theoretically, it's possible, but practically,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
it's pretty much impossible, because they spend 80 years of their life

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
cultivating habits that were going with that flood,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
with the flow, with the distraction, with the desire.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So that look, that looks.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
So basically, they got so entrenched now in those directions

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
that there are simply the faculties and not strong enough.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
The mind is not strong enough to theoretically,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
yeah, as there were cases in the suitors, the old lady.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Do you remember when she had three sons?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
They married and children, everything.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
And she and her husband were really well to do.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And her husband died.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
And she thought, well, why don't I divide all of our property?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And they had a lot of it, and give to my three sons.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And they looked after me.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And she did that.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And they looked after her in the beginning.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
But then, basically, they were just started

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
well, being annoyed by her.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
They didn't like her.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
So she would be going to visit one son,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
and she would hear the daughter and all saying,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
well, look, look who's coming again.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
She has other sons as well to look after her.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
But she's coming here only.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Then she heard that from all of them

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and got basically completely heartbroken.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And she was, well, over 80 probably.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Given, you know, grown-up grandchildren as well.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
And then she, she ordained because she didn't have anyone else to stay.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
And she saw the nuns having a monastery and getting food.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
But she couldn't go pin the bun because she was too old.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
So she was staying behind and cleaning the monastery

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
and pin the bun.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
But she was quite junior.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
She never met the Buddha.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
But one night, she had one nun repeating to another nun

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
what the Buddha said about impermanence.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And that, like, one of two lines.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
She was basically contemplated on day and night.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
While she was cleaning.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And then at night, she would be blue and walking meditation

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
in the corridor.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But she was so, she couldn't walk.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
So she was leaning on the wall with her hands.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
And she was walking up and down.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And she became another hand.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
So you can say, wow, she would.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
That was so basically, she put in hard work

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
after being completely broken by her own family,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
by her own children, abandoned.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
Basically, the very last stage of life.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
But that little instruction, she got second hand.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
She drilled it in deep enough until penetrated ignorance

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
and everything else.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And she became another hand.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
So it is possible, theoretically.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
And in a very rare cases.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So for omitting.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
My little one.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
You don't have to go around.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Trying to let everyone abandon you.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
No, of course not.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Just recommend this possibility that they might happen.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
And that's more than enough to go on.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
In terms of practice.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
There's the, you know, not a bit of a saying about the vertical view.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
And how to maintain the vertical view.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
And not to run away.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
And hide in distractions.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
How do you, as a monk, as someone is practicing?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
How do you...

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Well, by developing mindfulness.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
In their life.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
Not mindfulness in terms of some kind of weird robotic method,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
meditation, repetition, noting.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
But mindfulness in a sense of recognizing intentions behind your actions.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Because for as long as you have performed a certain action,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
intention to do that action is there on a more general level.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
It's your mindful of the reasons why you're doing things,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
why you want to do things.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And if they're rooted in unwholesome, you don't do it.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
If it's something you have to do, then you re-root it into something

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
that's not unwholesome.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Okay.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Such as eating food, as we discussed before.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
It can be rooted in a very unwholesome sense of pure sensuality.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Or if you contemplate and dwell on it and drill it long enough,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
you can root it in no.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I'll root it in necessity and I don't care what I eat.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
Whether it's the softest, nicest food or the roughest.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Because you remain rooted in necessity of eating food

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
to sustain the body so you can practice.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
So by being aware of your reasons and intentions,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
you will basically...

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Well, you won't be able to fall into bad faith.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
You won't be able to fall into that self-deception.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
And you won't be doing things for the sake of distraction.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
So that's how the vertical view is maintained.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Or, well, developed.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Because it will take time to kind of elevate your mind

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
to start looking vertically at the nature of things.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Because it's been just going, you know, flowing very horizontally

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
with a powerful flow of sensuality and distraction.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
So that's why people who don't...

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
Well, people haven't been practicing, but they might get ahead of it.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
Like, say a layperson, including myself at the time,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
when you discover Buddhism and then...

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
But then you can't differentiate.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Then when you recognize that you've been doing things for the sake of distraction,

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
then it feels like whatever you do,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
it was done because of that distraction.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
And most likely it was.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
But it doesn't mean that they won't be appointing the future whereby you can then do things.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
They won't be rooted in the distraction.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
So people sort of can't differentiate.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
And then they try...

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Well, they attempt to throw the whole thing away and then stop doing anything.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I must not do this.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I must not...

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Like what I was...

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
I must not exercise.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
I must not go out.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I must not go out for a walk.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I must not sit in the nature.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
No, no projects.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
No, nothing.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
But that's impossible because that then becomes your doing of not doing anything.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
That's what you're actively performing and you're not aware of it.

21:31.000 --> 21:39.000
Which means you're not actually developing mindfulness in regard to the intentions and the actions properly.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
And people like that, again, including myself,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
when you see others doing,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
it's all done for the distraction.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
But it's not.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, it can be, but not necessarily.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
So you need to know the motivation.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
And we discussed that before.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Like you're in the monastery,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
you want to go down to the reception room where the library is.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
So you look why...

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Well, where is your intention to do that?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Where is it rooted?

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
Is it rooted in the desire to maybe find some people or other monks there

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
and have something to chat with because you were actually bored in your room?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
But then you can't admit that to yourself.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
So then you say, no, I want to go and get some books to read,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
some good useful books to read.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
But the real reason remains rooted in going,

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
hoping to meet people there to chat for half an hour and get a bit of entertainment

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
or whatever.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Or distracted just because your room is getting too heavy.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Or then if it's rooted in that, you don't do it.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
If you still want...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
If you still think, well, no, I do want to get those books.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
And you make sure you stay focused on the reason...

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
on the wholesome reason for going down to the reception room where the library was

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
to get the books.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
And then even if you do meet other people,

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
well, you won't be entertaining that as you will be getting your books and getting back up.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
As opposed to, I will not do anything.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I will just sit in this room.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
And that's it.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I will never leave.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
That still will not re-root your intentions,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
which means you'll still remain rooted in that wholesome.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
And wholesome, you'll just abstain from it.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Sure, that should be a default response if you don't know what to do.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Abstain from it.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
Again, if in doubt, don't do it.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Like, well, in vinegar.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Acting out of doubt, it's a minor offense.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Even if actually what you've done wasn't an offense.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
The fact that you acted out of doubt was a minor offense.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
But that doesn't mean you should actually cultivate that

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
and stain that doubt for the rest of your life.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
But you should be asking why.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Well, exactly.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
So I don't know.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
So I'm not going to do it.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
But then I'm going to see why, how, and if you re-root it,

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
then you can do it.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
Again, was it marked with Japanese?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
When she asked about that, oh, I'm going for the Vassa retreat.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm going to be in seclusion for three months.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Give me a brief instruction so I can...

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And he said, whatever you know is an wholesome abandon it.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Whatever you know, it's wholesome.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Don't attend it.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
And she...

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
That was enough for Harara and she after three months.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
Because people realize they are kind of entrenched in an wholesome.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Then they fear everything.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
You know, you try to fear yourself from an wholesome.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
But the false response is throwing everything away,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
including wholesome and not whole everything.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
I will not do anything ever again because everything is an wholesome.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Everything is done for the distraction.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Everything is done because of my ego, my conceit.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
No.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
It's done because of ego and conceit and vanity.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
If that's where it's rooted.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
If you don't rooted in those unwholesome things,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
you won't be done for those purposes.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Externally, people might not be able to tell the difference.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
They'll say, oh, look, he's all vain and conceited, arrogant.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
But they can't tell the difference.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Because they themselves are rooted in those things.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
That's what they see.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I mean, you know, the Buddha himself.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
He said, when the first man he met after the life,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
and he said, I'm the greatest.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
I'm self-embodied.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Nobody's my teacher.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
And that's factual.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
But for the man who himself is a victim of his own conceit and vanity,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
he's a proof.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
So beat, my friend.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
The role he's either left.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Thinking, what was he thinking here?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
What he was the Buddha.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Because he couldn't judge.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
He couldn't tell.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
Because, you know.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
So that's why there is obviously the unwholesome things

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
that cannot be done against the presets.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
But in all of the other things, in between,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
things that are not necessarily good or bad,

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
you know, they are determined by your intention

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
that's behind performing those actions.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
So as I said, going to the library,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can be a bad thing.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Oh, I want to go on to my Sutta study group.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Well, that's a very noble thing to do.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Well, not necessarily.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
If you are going there because you want to be, you know,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
checking people up or distracting yourself

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
on the pretext of studying the Sutta's.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
So then some...

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
But many people judge things.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
Well, judge book by its cover.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
Because it requires a degree of wisdom to not do so.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Oh, the universe is accepted.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
The Sutta study group in the monastery is a good thing.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
We all go and do it.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
And probably like 90% of people might be doing it for completely wrong reasons.

26:31.000 --> 26:38.000
As I can watch, because I witnessed it many times.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
When people just go there, because you just feel like,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
hey, we're doing something together, we're part of it.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Just in the distraction, you're in the, you know,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
silent retreats or something like that,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
but there's nothing that's happening.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
No, no, this is good.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
And you feel justified.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
That's the thing.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
And by feeling justified, you must the fact that you yourself chose

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
to go there for the reasons of distraction

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
or something other unwholesome.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
But then you feel justified because externally,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
that is generally accepted is a good thing to do.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Ah, good, I'm fine then.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
But you're not actually.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
That is probably more dangerous.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Than just strongly, just say no to everything.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Like, I'm not doing anything.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
Yeah, I'm not very painful, but I can at least bring some wisdom eventually.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
As opposed to masking it like that.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
But this is good, because look, all of these senior Max said it's good,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and all of these people do it.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
It can't be if you do it for the right reasons.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Or is it all in as scholars?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Yeah.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
People who can't do as scholars do.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah, it works.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
You feel good.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Fully justified, spending your time, you know,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
studying etymology stuff, but not for purpose,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
getting the meaning, but for purpose, just becoming a scholar.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But you feel, again, all right, you know,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
spending five days, if you're weak,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
just printing random CDs,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
because they're all about the dama or whatever else.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And then you're doing, you know, publication.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Publications.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
And if you're full just because this is good work, it's dama work.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
You're doing it for completely wrong reasons.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
You're doing it because if you were to be put in the middle of the jungle right here,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
you would probably free count.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
And if that doesn't worry you,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
the fact that you're not able to exist anywhere in peace,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
well, that means you're not really practicing correctly.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Or at all.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
No matter how much you know.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
No matter how many years you spent,

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
dealing and working around and about the dama.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
You haven't got anything from it.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
Well, what is, you know,

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
you get this idea of the right efforts

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
to abandon and hold some cultivators.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
But that idea comes across as

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
you've got to be doing something,

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
doing the duty.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
You go and learn the suitors.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
You do practice this.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
A silver bar, a bar mask,

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
holding onto virtue and duty.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
No, no, just rights and rituals.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But duty, the rightful duty,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
the duty of me as a monk,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
the duty of holding on to it.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
And that's the thing.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Holding on to it means doing it for the wrong reasons.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
So, as I said, initially,

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
you have to hold on.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
That's a winner or a sealer comes first.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
You take it.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
You hold it.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
But in within that,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
you're supposed to develop discernments

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
that then makes you let it go without actually externally

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
breaking it necessarily.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Letting go of unwholesome.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
And letting go of wholesome,

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
you know, for another hand.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Doesn't mean he goes and becomes wild or whatever else.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
So, it's that sense of duty, yeah?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Because that's quite risky.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Because your whole existence as a monk

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
or as somebody who practices with a teaching

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
that you've invested 20 years in practicing Dharma,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
doing the treats or whatever else,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
there is that sense of duty

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
that has been built up.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
And now letting go of that

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
would basically expose your entire existence

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
since you became a monk.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Your entire, basically, investment.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Your entire life.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So that's where many people never do it.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But that's like people

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
who try to cross the show

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
but are too afraid and they stay.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
So they came to the show.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
They found what they need to cross.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
But they're too afraid to actually start crossing it.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
So they just stay in that show,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
looking at the other show

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
they're supposed to go

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
and they're often happy with that.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Because no matter how much,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
how many years you spend cultivating

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
and preparing,

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
when you start crossing that river,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
it's not a guarantee

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
that you will get to the other side.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
But that is the risk

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
that needs to be taken.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
You can't.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
You can't answer it.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
No.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Because if I try, I might fail.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
So I better not try

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
and then just remain concerned

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
about trying but never do so.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
And that's like people who spend their life

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
studying about the Dharma,

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
the scholarly aspect.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I mean, all the scholars do that

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
but many would do it for those reasons.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
So you end up evolving around it

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
but never really getting through with it.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Collecting information

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
from this teacher and teachers.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Learning about the other show

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
on the second hand.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Then write effort.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Write effort.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
How to do that?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
What is there?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
It's when they say

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
by doing things full-on with heavy energy.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
The right effort will be determined

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
by the right view.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
Because the right view always comes first.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
So right effort will be...

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Again, it's what I was speaking about.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Make sure...

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Well, right effort, right intention.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Right effort will come from right intention

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
which will come from right view

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
and right view would be making sure

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
the things you're about to do,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
the things you want to do.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
The things you feel you need to do

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
are not rooted in the unwholesome.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
There are duties you just have to do.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
But even then,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
it doesn't mean you shouldn't be mindful of them.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Or you should feel justified in doing them.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Oh, there are things I need to do.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Bottom line is I always choose

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
to do these things.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Even if it feels,

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
oh, I need to do this.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah, you're the one who chooses that

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
to be that which you need to do.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Can you make it effortless?

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
Like, it's kind of...

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
What are you doing?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
You don't have the intentions to do it themselves.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Yeah.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
That would be the case of another hand.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
But that's the thing.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Like, for protrusional,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
that would mean like,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
you are not there.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
These things are just done.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
And on paper,

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
that can be said to be true.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
But that can be achieved only

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
through fully doing them.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
So to speak.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
And by fully doing them,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
I mean fully,

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
thoroughly accepting responsibility

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
for every slightest intention

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
you choose to act upon.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Not the other way.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Not by kind of finding a state

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
where you forget about your intentions.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
And then things just happen.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
No, that's completely the opposite.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
But it might kind of revolve around full circle

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
and externally almost look the same.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
But there is this on the inner side,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
there is this whole trajectory of a certain

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
that you actually have to go through with.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
And you go through that protrusional start

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
by fully accepting responsibility

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
for everything he does.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Why?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Because he chooses to do all of it.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Even things that he has no choice about.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
So to speak.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Things that happen to you,

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
happen to you because you've

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
taken, you've chosen to keep

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
that the other things can affect.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
So like misfortunes, accidents,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
they're not really your fault.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
If they affect you,

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
well, that's a new why,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
because you're holding onto the body,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
there is subject to misfortunes.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
Subject to accidents and so on.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
So you take full responsibility

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
for things that you cannot possibly control.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
That's why it's so hard and heavy,

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
especially in the beginning.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
But then, by fully accepting that responsibility,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
you literally go through that responsibility

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
without abandoning it.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
And then you find the way out,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
in case of another hunt,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
whereby, while it does remain,

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
it's a pure individual.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Pugula, just the five aggregates,

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
free from Upadana,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
and they just rise and fall

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
until they break apart.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
But that can be done only

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
when you actually go through

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
with a whole think of responsibility,

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
intention, not performing.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
So basically, unwholesome needs to be avoided,

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
not just,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
or I keep the presets,

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
but even mentally.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
So even if it's not really,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
if it's not really morally wrong,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
the fact that I was about to go to library

35:07.000 --> 35:13.000
because I was becoming a bit anxious in my room,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
so I needed a distraction.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
That is like shooting yourself in the head

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
from the point of view of dharma practice.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
That is a serious mistake.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
And you can,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
you'll be impeccable externally,

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
perfect month form,

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
and never break any rule.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
But you keep doing things like that,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
you'll never ever progress in any way,

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
because you're just not really looking at the root,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
at the core of the problem.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
You, as you said the other day,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
you have resisting the possibility

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
of suffering, of pain, of pain.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Even when there is no pain,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
there is a possibility of pain,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
which hurts you basically,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and you're acting upon that.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
So you're acting because you're afraid.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
So you're acting out of unhulsing.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
So you're, so instead of going

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
part of that distraction,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
you sit in your room,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
and the possibility of pain

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
starts becoming more of a reality of pain.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Then you have to deal with it.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
That's why I did that suit.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And the Buddha said when he was in that jungle,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
was it fear and dread?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I think it was called fear and dread.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
When he said if there would be a fear

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
or an awesome state arising while he was walking,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
he would not change that posture

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
until he dispels the fear first.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Why?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Because whatever he would have done,

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
while the fear was present,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
he would have been rooted in the fear.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
And he recognized that.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
He could have been rooted in.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
There's nothing unhulsing

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
with sitting down once you've been walking.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
But if you're doing it for the reasons of fear

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
that arose while you were walking,

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
that is unhulsing.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
And nobody externally can tell you that,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
because nobody externally can see that,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
which is why don't pay much heed

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
to people judging things based on external factors.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Oh, and there's another sentence

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
that says there's monks or people

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
who are very agreeable, very soft-spoken,

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
and people love them,

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
and people praise them,

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
and it's so great,

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
it's so nice, it's so nice,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
and they're completely ignorant to two generations.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And then you had other people

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
who were monks and peoples

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
who were quite hard to live with,

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
unbearable root,

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
whatever else,

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
and they were at hands.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Because those things pertain

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
to basically the personal levels.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
So as you can see,

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
I don't know.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
He said down because he was tired.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
That's what externally might appear like.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Well, no, he said down because he was afraid walking.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Well, the monk who was storing rice

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
and then rehydrating it the next day or so.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Oh, the one because the village was too poor.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Yeah.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
And he didn't want them to waste the food,

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
because they would be starving.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
But then some people could say,

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
of what kind of monk is that?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
He didn't keep that rule,

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
and he exposed food.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Yeah, the Buddha replied to him,

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
but not on that personal level,

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
but just from a higher perspective point of view,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
whereby in the future,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
doing that,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
was most likely result in unwholesome,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
because most people are not actually developed

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
as that monk.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah, he was never.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
So then he said,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
well, it's still don't do it.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
The intention was wholesome,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
but externally, the vineyard,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
don't do it because other people will not be able to do it.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
But the thing is,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
the point I said,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
people can,

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
people of Petruginus can praise and blame you

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
for just with that,

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
but praise and blame is not a measure

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
of somebody's attainments.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
No.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
If he gives blame or praise,

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
it's going to be on the level of...

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Of Petruginus.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Of Petruginus.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
So if they praise you,

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
if the Petruginus praise an arrogant,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
he does it for the wrong reasons,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
because if he were to do it for the right reasons,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
he would be at least sort of by himself,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
and he would know where the right reasons are.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
If Petruginus blamed you again,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
he does it for the wrong reasons,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
because if he were to have the right ones,

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
he would be only comforting.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Yeah.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Well, you know, people just assume,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
you need to have,

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
well, based on,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
based on your own,

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
you know,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
life and learning or whatever,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
you just assume that,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
a wise person,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
person knows must be some, you know,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
old man,

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
but then you had,

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
you had the suitors,

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
you had like,

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
what was that?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
When the king came today,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
the way they were staying,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the first row, sort of,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
and the king went to see him,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
and King Pasinali, maybe.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
And on the way there,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
he was meeting all these monks,

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
doing walk meditation

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
and just just living there,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
with a young,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
in the prime of their youth,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
a life that could still fully,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
enjoy central pleasures,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
and they looked really happy and healthy,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
in this remote forest,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
and then he went to the Buddha,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
and he was just smitten by this whole thing,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
which was such an experience,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
he was praising it,

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
and it was in the end,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
because, you know, they don't follow,

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
on account of any external observances,

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
and they're certainly not happy,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
on account of those things,

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
they follow,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
because they understood the dharma,

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
and you know,

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
well, you had children,

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
back in the day,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
understanding the dharma,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
obviously, that's quite unlikely today,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
but it's still possible.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
So it's this understanding,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
which can't be really measured externally,

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
certainly not,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
by the measure of Patugina.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
So that's quite,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I think that's also a useful thing,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
for somebody who knows that he's a Patugina,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
and wants to practice to know,

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
because,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
you won't become evicting then,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
of sort of developing,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
no, this is what's right,

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
this is what's wrong,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and then convince yourself,

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
that you, as a Patugina,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
know what right is,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
and what wrong is,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
because if you were to know that,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
you wouldn't be a Patugina.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
The description of Sotepan,

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
I mean the Sotepan,

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
is he knows right,

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
as right,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and wrong, as wrong.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
So if somebody who knows that he's not a Sotepan,

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
says, no, this is right,

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
and believes that,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
he's just blocking his own development.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Oh, you hold that view now,

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
and deep down you know,

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
actually, that you don't really know,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and you certainly don't have a criteria.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
So you can't help by having a judgment.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
That's just a natural thing.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
It's thinking is a form of judgment already.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
But what you can't help,

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
is not the other believes on account of your judgment,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
especially when you know,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
that you don't really know.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
So you do have your,

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
you can't help it,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
but you make sure that you find

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
the right judgment,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
the Samadhi,

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
the right view,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and then you use that as a criteria,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
or rather that becomes the criteria.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
You become that criteria.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
So I'm back to the room sitting in your room.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
What?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Both of this.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
You sit in there.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
You want to practice then.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
But now you want to go downstairs to speak to people,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
to distracts all the various distractions.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
You want to read a book and a novel.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
But you don't want to do it.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
You don't do it.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
So you're sitting there.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
It's pain.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
The thing is all the possibilities

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
and the distractions you can go.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
That's all you have.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
It's pain of boredom.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
It's poor and essential.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
And so the best.

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
So to be appraising right effort,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
to be seen that,

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
seeing that that is the reason that boredom is there.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
And maybe investigating it.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
Well, the right effort would be basically not going.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Not leaving the room.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Not acting out of fear.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
That would be the right effort.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
As to what you do on a more particular level,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
it would be basically why.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
Ask yourself why is there a whole boredom?

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Not going out.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Why is it a problem?

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
Why is it unwanted?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Why does it make you suffer?

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
And then you realize that it's not about you staying in the room

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
or not staying in the room.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
It's about you suffering.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
So you don't want to suffer.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
That's why you want to leave the room.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
That's why you're going to get distracted.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
And that is the core of dumb suffering.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
And freedom from it.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
So why do I don't want to be touched by the unpleasant feeling?

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
Why by default I resist that.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
Why by default I act upon it.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
Why I take it for granted that I must run away from this feeling?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
That's all you have to do.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
The tiny little thorn needs to be pulled out.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
Just a tiny little resistance to pain.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
You pull that out.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
You won't be touched by anything.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
But you certainly won't be pulling anything out.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
If you're running away whenever these things and pressure arises.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
If you act upon distractions, leave the room, attempt to find duty food

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
and meaningful sort of things that end up being just distractions,

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
or whatever.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
No, it's my duty to spread the dumb mind.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
You know, do the public case, no.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Your duty is to become another hand.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
And then whatever you do, or at least sort of another,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
then whatever you do will be coming out of the right view.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Even if externally people don't recognize it as such,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
that's not your concern.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
There is a major need for exiting there.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
If you're a pain.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
There's fearlessness in it.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
Basically, the moment you stop feeling the pain,

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
you can get up and leave if you want to do that.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
Because you won't be rooted in anything out of fear.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
So the Buddha wanted to sit down,

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
but he made sure he removed the fear, and then he said that.

45:00.000 --> 45:07.000
So you can't possibly not do anything for the rest of your life.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
You just want to make sure that it's never ever rooted again in an awesome way.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
Sometimes, there will be quickly remedied.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
Sometimes you might just have to sit in the room and endure it for days.

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
But you know, that won't last forever either.

45:27.000 --> 45:34.000
It's all about taking for granted the resistance to unpleasant feeling.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
That needs to be uprooted.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
That tiny little thing needs to be pulled out.

45:39.000 --> 45:44.000
And then all the other past and infection on account of it will be gone.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Eventually it will.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
Because it's not being infected anymore.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
By death.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
Oh, that's healthy.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
And the craving for the pleasant.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Well, they are the same.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
You crave for pleasure.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
Because basically not having enough of that pleasure is unpleasant.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
So your whole life revolves around fear of pain.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
And even people are going to subject themselves to pain.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Prove themselves that they are not afraid of pain.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
They need to prove themselves because underneath that they are afraid of pain.

46:20.000 --> 46:30.000
So they try to override it.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000
But yeah, because if you're afraid of pain, then you might plot practicing the death.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
You might have more reason for becoming a man called...

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
That is the reason.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
That is the sole reason.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I am subject to suffering.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
I am like when a layman reflects before he goes thought in the suitors.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I am prey to suffering.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Pray.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
So I'm under.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Nothing got me.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Yet.

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
But the fact that I feel like I'm prey to this suffering means the hunch is there.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Always.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
And he might pounce at any moment.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
So it doesn't necessarily pounce.

47:11.000 --> 47:18.000
But you recognize that you are actually prey in this field when there are serious carnivores.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
So even if they don't kill you, the fate that they might kill you, that is a suffering itself.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
That concern, that fear.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
So again, I am subject to suffering.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Means I don't necessarily suffer.

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
But I recognize that if suffering does land at some point, I am subjected to it.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I won't be able to prevent that.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
I might be able to deal with it as an aftermath in hindsight.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I might be able to resolve it or whatever.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
But the fact that he was touched in the first place, that is the problem.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
One and only.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
That's it.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
And that's what he would have said.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
The only thing he could possibly teach is suffering and freedom from it.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Because everything else is done because of that, whether people know it or not.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
You pursue pleasure because not having enough of it is pun pleasant.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
But then always you realize you never have enough of it.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
But then you can pursue it more.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And it's just more and more unpleasure.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
You run away from pain.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Why?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Because it's unpleasant.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
You're running away from pleasant.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Well, it is unpleasant.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Yeah.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Because you avoided it temporarily.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And then it's like a temporary risk.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
Means there is obviously no greater perspective than the wisdom.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
Because scratching your itch, temporarily relieved you, but in the long run,

48:29.000 --> 48:36.000
making it much more infected and worse.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
Some people would say that people are much more distracted nowadays,

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
but you know, with funds or whatever internet.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Is it different time?

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
I think it's just that it's more proliferated, but the roots were the same.

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
The roots of distraction, they're rooted in the same things.

48:56.000 --> 49:06.000
So people today are more frivolous, probably more divorced from the nature of things

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
because of that proliferation.

49:08.000 --> 49:16.000
But then nature is still there, which means the roots of the distractions are still the same.

49:16.000 --> 49:24.000
Well, if you want to get things going quick, you want to start to practice,

49:24.000 --> 49:31.000
you want to see the truth and understand reality.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
The precepts.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
The precepts are restraints.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
And then we'll show you the fear quite quickly.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Put down your phone switch of the internet.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Put down your phone switch of the internet.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
Well, try and preserve it, but do not try and keep it.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Don't eat like a pig.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Restrain yourself.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
Basically, start practicing restraint in regard to your senses,

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
and all these things will be revealed very quickly.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
And then, have to be very careful.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Don't start holding a view.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
I can't do that.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
And view holding views on the counter is what I said.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Whereby, you know that you don't know,

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
but you accept that what you're doing now is the right thing.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
And then you develop a belief that this is the right thing to do.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
But you still don't know for yourself that that's the right thing to do.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
That's why we really said that, you know,

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
monks can live, we'd run from sensuality physically,

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
and then even mentally.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
But then they end up arguing and debating and holding onto views.

50:29.000 --> 50:34.000
And because of that, Mars still controls that.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
But again, one thing at a time.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
You know, you can't be dealing with the views

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
if your behavior is still under your strength.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
So, with your strength behavior, don't pursue distractions.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
And then, in view of the views for a while,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
and then they'll become apparent, and you'll know,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
then you basically, again, what I was saying,

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
you stop rooting them in the end also.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Reviews.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Or you kind of help by having views.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
So then you just want to know, make sure that you know that

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
when you have views.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
So you know that these are inevitable.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
The views are inevitable.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
But what I can't do is not hold them blindly

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
to such an extent that I believe, even if it's about the sea

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
like the Dharma, it's still not justification

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
to hold the views in regard to it.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Because that's a...

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Yeah, abandoning views.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
There's a view that nothing pleases me.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Oh, yeah.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Nothing, yeah.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
And that view pleases you.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Yeah, that's the view.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
That's what people say, oh, you don't hold 20 fixed views.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
Well, that is a fixed view that you clearly hold on to.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
So you don't hold the views,

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
but recognizing the views are inevitable.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
That's already okay.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
So you do have views, but you don't hold to them.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
So that's what it's meant.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
Doesn't mean like, don't hold the views like not actually

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
have any views.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
That's impossible.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Even the right views are views.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
They just replaces the wrong views.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
So that's the most you can...

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Well, that's all you can do.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
That's all you need to do.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Just replace your wrong views with the right view

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
and it will lead you to the other hand.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
Your wrong attention with the right.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Yeah, exactly.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Right, wrong attention.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But no, because they're all the attention.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
I'll never attend anything.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
I'll never do anything.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
I'll never leave this room for the rest of my life.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Because everything is bad.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
No, that's your attention.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Well, that's something you're clearly doing.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
You're clearly intending.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
You're clearly performing and you're fully not aware of.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
But that view in that suit says,

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
I think it's in Magima 74.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Nothing pleases me.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
That first view.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
That first view.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
That first view.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Because you would...

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
You would basically...

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Nothing pleases me.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
You wouldn't commit to any other.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
More particular view.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
But then, you know,

52:44.000 --> 52:52.000
there is that one that you need to deal with.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
But yeah, I don't...

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
No, I'm not obsessed with...

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
Existence.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Sorry?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Everything that is...

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
You know, pulled into it anymore.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Because the only reason you were pulled into it

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
was because you were acting out of fear of suffering.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
You were prey to suffering

53:15.000 --> 53:21.000
and you were just doing what prey does, running.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
So, you know, there might be a hunter behind this tree.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
If you don't know,

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
but you just run.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
And then, you know,

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
when you know there's a child,

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
you know, there's something...

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
You might feel something chasing you.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
There's a kid in the dark or whatever.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
And then you start running out of fear to get quicker to your home.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
But once you're given to running,

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
then you become even more afraid.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
And even if there's nothing chasing you,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
once you're given to running,

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
you'll need to run even faster.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Because that's how it works.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
It's like an avalanche that you're responsible for.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
A flood. A floodgate.

53:57.000 --> 54:25.000
It's open.
