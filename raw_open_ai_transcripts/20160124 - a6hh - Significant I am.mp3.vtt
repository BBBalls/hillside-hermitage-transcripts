00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
I am actually special interested in that you said that I am, I am actually staying up to

00:10.400 --> 00:16.600
as a background, but that is what I can't see usually, but when it appears, I am, actually

00:16.600 --> 00:24.400
that's not the one that is very unhealthy, I am, the sense of self, it never appears

00:24.400 --> 00:30.960
directly, because if it were to appear directly, then you can just say, ah, this is not myself

00:30.960 --> 00:36.800
and that will be the end of it, but as in like in the sutras, the Buddha said, putujana

00:36.800 --> 00:42.680
takes, with not self, he takes himself or with self, takes the not self or with self,

00:42.680 --> 00:48.560
he takes the self, but he can never with not self, take the not self, which means whatever

00:48.560 --> 00:57.240
putujana looks self will be there one way or the other, so that's why when people try

00:57.240 --> 01:03.720
to apply the practice and say, ah, not, not, not myself, not myself to everything, that

01:03.720 --> 01:08.400
doesn't work because it's just like a blanket attitude that you apply to everything,

01:08.400 --> 01:14.240
but that means your sense of self is actually left out and doing that applying, so that's

01:14.240 --> 01:21.040
why in the sutras it says, all the terminations are impermanent, all the terminations are

01:21.040 --> 01:26.760
suffering, all things are not self, it doesn't say all things are impermanent, all things

01:26.760 --> 01:31.360
are suffering, all things are not self, which is what most people do, they say ah, everything

01:31.360 --> 01:36.320
is impermanent, everything is not myself, but it doesn't work like, I mean that's true,

01:36.320 --> 01:40.880
it's not incorrect to say that, but it's not an open eye, it doesn't lead on, you won't

01:40.880 --> 01:46.040
bring understanding of the Dharma, because the person needs to include himself into

01:46.040 --> 01:51.960
his insight, and doing that is seeing that yourself, your sense of self depends upon

01:51.960 --> 01:57.920
something that it's not yours, and when you see that yourself directly stands upon something

01:57.920 --> 02:04.880
that is not yours, then automatically that sense of self is not yours either, so you don't

02:04.880 --> 02:09.560
have to then ok, now I will say to myself, this is not myself, no, your experience then

02:09.560 --> 02:14.040
is the experience of not self, if you see the terminations of that self as impermanent

02:14.040 --> 02:20.760
and as suffering, so that's why I was saying like, it's not incorrect to say ah, nothing

02:20.760 --> 02:24.960
is myself, yeah nothing can be yourself, but in terms of the practice it just doesn't

02:24.960 --> 02:30.080
work, I mean it can work in terms of making people feel better, it's almost like a form

02:30.080 --> 02:35.240
of denial, just saying everything is not myself, which is why it's more important to first

02:35.240 --> 02:40.600
recognize that there is a sense of self, I can never see directly, I can never take it

02:40.600 --> 02:44.920
out, I can never say this is not mine, you'll be finished with it, so you have to recognize

02:44.920 --> 02:51.160
that it's there, and then affect your whole experience in your practice through seeing

02:51.160 --> 02:57.800
the terminations, so then the whole experience will be experience of not self, but not just

02:57.800 --> 03:03.040
selectively picking true, so everything needs to be affected, because although you might

03:03.040 --> 03:08.640
not be able to pinpoint the sense of self, you know for sure that it's within the experience

03:08.640 --> 03:13.400
as a whole, so if you're bent on the experience as a whole, you include it, that abandoning

03:13.400 --> 03:18.280
includes the abandoning of the sense of self, so that was the whole, the whole talking

03:18.280 --> 03:23.280
about the general background in particular intentions, because if you're just going

03:23.280 --> 03:28.240
out particular intentions means you don't really see what's in the background, but then

03:28.240 --> 03:32.960
if you don't even see what's in the background, you don't even know how to look for the background,

03:32.960 --> 03:38.680
so whenever you look for the background, you look as if it's particular, you just make

03:38.680 --> 03:41.760
it, make it actual, make it right in front of you, which means something else is a background

03:41.760 --> 03:46.800
which means the sense of self is hiding somewhere else now, so you have to learn to be mindful

03:46.800 --> 03:54.560
of the general background without already telling it and making it into particular, because

03:54.560 --> 04:01.040
it's general, and if that's not general something else will be general, so learning to do that

04:01.040 --> 04:06.640
means, ah, you start to notice more peripherally, without moving your vision left or right

04:06.640 --> 04:12.600
top or down, you just start to include more in what you already seen, but if each time

04:12.600 --> 04:17.800
you want to see something you keep moving around, you'll end up seeing only that, which

04:17.800 --> 04:26.160
you move to, nothing around it, nothing more, so that was the whole point of that email

04:26.160 --> 04:31.440
in the sense of I am. What did you mean that the intentional situation?

04:31.440 --> 04:36.920
Well, even the general background is already intentional, obviously the intentions are

04:36.920 --> 04:43.520
not as defined as they are particularly, but as I told you that before, a general situation

04:43.520 --> 04:51.640
being in this room gives you a certain set of particular intentions as possibilities

04:51.640 --> 05:00.480
that are allowable in this room, so for example if you go outside, you won't have a chance,

05:00.480 --> 05:04.880
you won't be able to intend to use this water filter to drink water, because that's

05:04.880 --> 05:10.880
in here, so your general situation has changed, so now, okay, drinking water is important,

05:10.880 --> 05:15.400
so you start modifying your general situation so that particular intentions can arise where

05:15.400 --> 05:25.480
you can get the water to drink, so it's not the intentions only come from you, like when

05:25.480 --> 05:30.000
you think you're intending, the only reason you're able to intend is because your general

05:30.000 --> 05:34.640
situation allows you those possibilities that now you're attending and they become

05:34.640 --> 05:41.080
intentions, when you can't create anything in other words, you can't come up, because

05:41.080 --> 05:47.160
if you come up with new things, an intention of a new thing is given from their general

05:47.160 --> 05:54.880
background, so you can only use or choose between the given set of possibilities based

05:54.880 --> 06:02.200
on the general situation, where you are, your abilities, and like body, and bodily predispositions,

06:02.200 --> 06:09.080
height, strength, complexion, all of those are form and they partake and rather they

06:09.080 --> 06:18.360
are fundamental form of general situation, because you know a short disabled person cannot

06:18.360 --> 06:23.800
have intentions of running marathon, he might think about it, but for him it's inherently

06:23.800 --> 06:30.080
removed from his fundamental situation that they're determined by his body, and so again

06:30.080 --> 06:35.400
he can use different set, he can focus on different possibilities that arise and then

06:35.400 --> 06:40.840
pursue those directions, but either way all he can do is kind of modify things that are

06:40.840 --> 06:45.600
given beforehand, he can't create anything, and nobody can do anything that he's choosing

06:45.600 --> 06:50.240
also based on his ability to give away thoughts, well yeah, like it's not that kind of your

06:50.240 --> 06:55.960
choice is given for you, so there is responsibility for the choice, but the possibilities of your

06:55.960 --> 07:01.920
choice are given beforehand, like when you choose between yes and no, well yes and

07:01.920 --> 07:06.560
no are given beforehand as a form of choice, and then you choose one on the count of the

07:06.560 --> 07:14.880
other, well it's basically your intentionality that it chooses, by attending the reason for

07:14.880 --> 07:20.200
choosing yes, you choose yes, by attending the reason you choose no, you choose no, by

07:20.200 --> 07:25.240
you know giving into the external pressure or whatever, various factors that affect your

07:25.240 --> 07:30.040
choice, that's high works, so it's not you mean that it's because our hands still has

07:30.040 --> 07:36.040
a choice, but he doesn't have the sense of self anymore, so basically sense of self interferes

07:36.040 --> 07:44.200
and takes credit for these things that happen by himself, but it's important to first see

07:44.200 --> 07:50.600
that and then take responsibility for the choice as if it is you who is choosing it, because

07:50.600 --> 07:55.720
that's the only way you can actually through that abandon the sense of self, if you don't

07:55.720 --> 08:00.280
see that and then immediately start saying well I haven't, I'm not doing anything, he's

08:00.280 --> 08:05.240
just this body and everything, that's the denial, for protrusion and that's the denial,

08:05.240 --> 08:10.960
so protrusion first has to admit that he is, that he's choosing, that he's responsible,

08:10.960 --> 08:14.880
that there are results of his actions, that there is mother, there is father, there is killing,

08:14.880 --> 08:18.640
there is giving life, there is all of that, like the mundane right view that Buddha talks

08:18.640 --> 08:24.200
about, once he's able to admit that, to see that, then he can begin abandoning sense of

08:24.200 --> 08:29.440
self through that, without abandoning that view, he abandones his sense of self based on

08:29.440 --> 08:36.560
that, but usually people kind of take a shortcut and then they go straight into saying well everything

08:36.560 --> 08:41.960
is not self, so nobody's doing any action anyway and so on and so forth, which is actually

08:41.960 --> 08:46.800
similar to the wrong views of the Buddha's time that he was often discussing, when people

08:46.800 --> 08:51.520
would say well there is no door, there is no Buddha bad, it's just elements and so on and

08:51.520 --> 08:57.480
so forth, the reason why there is wrong is because there is a sense of self, it's a mistake,

08:57.480 --> 09:02.280
but it's really as a mistake, so denying a mistake means you'll never be able to solve

09:02.280 --> 09:07.920
the mistake, to correct it, to rectify it, because you denied, so first you have to admit

09:07.920 --> 09:18.720
that there is a mistake and then you'll be able to fix it, well it's a misunderstanding

09:18.720 --> 09:24.840
that, it's not misunderstanding that there is a modification, it's not misunderstanding

09:24.840 --> 09:29.520
that there is an intention for modification, but a misunderstanding mistake is that it comes

09:29.520 --> 09:36.680
from himself, that his self is the owner of it, he removes the ownership, all of those

09:36.680 --> 09:42.000
things still stay, he's just the ownership is a confusion, thinking that it's me, it's

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
mine, I'm doing it.

09:44.000 --> 09:54.120
It's very actually a different point, because I observe a choice, a or b, they are given,

09:54.120 --> 10:00.720
but which one I chose, that was actually it appeared, that thought, exactly, but then

10:00.720 --> 10:09.160
you are responsible for accepting that thought, as a decision, as a choice, so yes the thought

10:09.160 --> 10:16.160
appeared, you didn't create it either, but you do choose, you do accept, to go with it,

10:16.160 --> 10:22.000
or not go with it, just see what I mean, so even if the thought appears, you can't say

10:22.000 --> 10:28.240
the choice has been made for me, no, you always make the choice, yeah, so by doing that,

10:28.240 --> 10:35.680
by recognizing that, then you can disown yourself making the choice, not deny yourself making

10:35.680 --> 10:40.720
the choice, there is a big difference there, and the difference is, in that order of things,

10:40.720 --> 10:45.440
first you admit that there is a mistake, and then through the admittance of mistake, you

10:45.440 --> 10:50.560
can rectify the mistake, well the second that denial is different, it's basically, you

10:50.560 --> 10:54.360
see there is a mistake, and then you deny the mistake, say, ah, it's not mine, it doesn't

10:54.360 --> 10:59.240
exist, it's all fixed already, not a problem, we are all in a barn or whatever, and then

10:59.240 --> 11:02.560
you don't see the mistake anyway, you think you fixed it, but actually you just obscured

11:02.560 --> 11:04.560
it.

11:04.560 --> 11:09.120
So taking up responsibility for your choice, like really feeling responsible, like I am

11:09.120 --> 11:16.120
doing this, I am choosing this, that is the first step, through that you can abandon sense

11:16.120 --> 11:21.600
of I without abandoning responsibility for the action, and that's how you overcome the

11:21.600 --> 11:26.600
action finally, but for as long as you are avoiding responsibility for it, you are avoiding

11:26.600 --> 11:36.320
the nature of action, which means you are not overcoming the karma, the first accepting

11:36.320 --> 11:42.840
that this is, I am, I am the choice, yeah, the choice is there, and there is a mistake

11:42.840 --> 11:48.480
of ownership, but it's real as such, so you have to accept it, and then you'll be able

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
to fix it.

11:49.480 --> 12:14.600
Well, the mistake is making the karma, which is why the decision remains bound to samsara,

12:14.600 --> 12:22.040
so it's a real thing, if he finds out that it's a mistake, it ceases, so he's free,

12:22.040 --> 12:26.440
but yeah, it's not just an illusion, or something like that, because samsara is real, and the

12:26.440 --> 12:30.920
results of the samsara are very real, and the results of one's actions are very, very

12:30.920 --> 12:36.480
real, I could even assert that sometimes people did a little thing that was wrong, but then

12:36.480 --> 12:43.120
it resulted in a lot later on, so it's never guarantee, thinking well, be fine or not,

12:43.120 --> 12:48.440
which means that responsibility is real, so for as long as the person doesn't admit

12:48.440 --> 12:56.320
the mistake, the misunderstanding, misappropriation, he won't be able to fix it, so sometimes

12:56.320 --> 13:03.000
people are too keen to fix it, so they quickly fall into denial of it, not self, not self,

13:03.000 --> 13:07.240
not mine, not self, the science has proved nothing is self, nothing is mine, but they're

13:07.240 --> 13:13.040
just obscures, that doesn't accept the responsibility, if you start saying to yourself,

13:13.040 --> 13:18.400
not self, not mine, through the acceptance of that responsibility, and never abandoning

13:18.400 --> 13:24.000
that responsibility, that's a different thing, but usually people do that, they say to

13:24.000 --> 13:29.840
themselves, not self, in order to avoid the responsibility, because it feels like a fix,

13:29.840 --> 13:34.440
but it's not, well, it's a temporary thing, which means it doesn't really work in a long

13:34.440 --> 13:35.440
time.

13:35.440 --> 13:49.360
How do disolving the accepted it is, it is I am the one, I am responsible for it?

13:49.360 --> 13:54.200
Yeah, disolving, I mean I use that word, but it's not, it's not like, you don't do it,

13:54.200 --> 14:00.040
oh, I don't own this anymore, you disobey it by seeing that you cannot own it in the first

14:00.040 --> 14:06.480
place, by finding out that it's actually impossible to be owned, not knowing that it's impossible

14:06.480 --> 14:11.120
to own something, just because you don't know that it's impossible, that's why you own

14:11.120 --> 14:12.120
it.

14:12.120 --> 14:18.360
So, finding out that actually, own or not, just makes no difference to the thing, it cannot

14:18.360 --> 14:23.840
access it, cannot master, you cannot be the master of it, nor control it, automatically

14:23.840 --> 14:29.960
you kind of, you stopped owning it, even if you say, oh, this is my book, this is my

14:29.960 --> 14:34.400
chair, this is my phone, internally you don't own anything because you're sold through

14:34.400 --> 14:41.720
the nature of it, and there was the case in the suit as well, when people focus on designations

14:41.720 --> 14:46.480
and they think, oh, you shouldn't be saying mine or something, no, it's just a designation

14:46.480 --> 14:51.640
and the Buddha said, that how that uses what I am, but for him, it doesn't mean anything,

14:51.640 --> 14:56.640
certainly, it doesn't mean what it means for Patugian, so it's the same for mine and

14:56.640 --> 15:02.080
belonging to me or whatever else, it's basically the internal connection, it's what matters,

15:02.080 --> 15:07.040
like people can go around saying, not mine, not mine, yet hold tightly on to everything,

15:07.040 --> 15:11.320
because they don't know the way out, another person might not pay any attention to what

15:11.320 --> 15:14.320
he says, but internally he won't own anything.

15:14.320 --> 15:20.920
I feel it's very interesting that the evening, in the case of Arabian, actually, everything

15:20.920 --> 15:28.120
is going on from outside, no one can see it, because everything is the same way, but

15:28.120 --> 15:33.200
he knows everything is not the case, only there's a difference, and some people think

15:33.200 --> 15:38.360
they don't feel around, they don't feel, and they don't feel like it flies in the clouds

15:38.360 --> 15:44.120
or whatever else, but no, again, you read the suit as an even the other Arab, and sometimes

15:44.120 --> 15:51.120
you wouldn't be able to recognize another Arab, you would be a bit harder, the Buddha could

15:51.120 --> 15:56.520
do it instantly, or some other monks would grade the powers, but generally, yeah, you

15:56.520 --> 16:00.240
had to talk to the person, you had to see what their view was, that's what the Buddha

16:00.240 --> 16:05.040
was saying, like, don't, don't ever leave anything unturned, like you should question, interrogate

16:05.040 --> 16:09.480
each other, look for the meaning, if the meaning is not clear, press further, until the meaning

16:09.480 --> 16:13.840
is clear, see where your understanding is, see what other monks understand, and that's

16:13.840 --> 16:19.040
how both parties learn, if there is a genuine knowledge, that is being pushed further

16:19.040 --> 16:23.240
further, not just the theoretical debate or something like that, but it's not just that

16:23.240 --> 16:28.520
they were talking, but knowing each other's views, knowing where they are, they could tell,

16:28.520 --> 16:33.560
oh, he's an Arab, or he is probably very soon going to be an Arab, or he's far from

16:33.560 --> 16:39.440
an Arab, but if he makes enough effort, he will be one and so on and so forth.

16:39.440 --> 16:43.600
It was very interesting, you said that a lot of many people think that we were born,

16:43.600 --> 16:50.520
right at all here, to see, and to smell, and to taste, and even that is often not a reason,

16:50.520 --> 16:55.840
actually, that's not really a reason, you're not born for anything, nor for nothing.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.840
Just me saying this.

16:56.840 --> 17:03.760
Yeah, the idea of purpose comes from already from that mistake.

17:03.760 --> 17:08.360
I think the Buddha said a problem, a few occasions, but I remember one instance when he was

17:08.360 --> 17:18.080
saying that because a person takes what it's not his, he makes use out of it, then he basically

17:18.080 --> 17:24.720
owns what you become indebted to tomorrow, and then Mara can do whatever he wants.

17:24.720 --> 17:29.920
So by using things that belong to Mara, you are in Mara's control, and then they ask

17:29.920 --> 17:34.200
him what are those things, and he said it's the sight, sound and smell, taste, touch

17:34.200 --> 17:40.520
as I know, all of the senses and sense bases are Mara's domain, which means they're

17:40.520 --> 17:46.280
not used to begin with, your own eyes, they don't belong to you, they're there, they do

17:46.280 --> 17:51.240
the purpose of looking or whatever else, but none of that obliges you to take them as

17:51.240 --> 17:58.680
yours, only not knowing that they are not yours, you automatically take them as yours.

17:58.680 --> 18:03.520
That's why even a newborn baby is already affected by a vision, although it didn't grow

18:03.520 --> 18:10.040
out, it didn't develop designation of the structure, the mind structure and the mentality

18:10.040 --> 18:13.640
intentional, it's already there, just waiting to develop.

18:13.640 --> 18:21.280
Actually, all intentions are rising, actually they're like a want to hear, want to see.

18:21.280 --> 18:26.880
Well, everything is intentional in that sense, yeah, it's just removing, or rather seeing

18:26.880 --> 18:34.240
that the center of intention is not in you or mine, it's because things are already intentional.

18:34.240 --> 18:40.080
That's the only reason intention can be there, but you have to see that through accepting

18:40.080 --> 18:48.120
responsibility for your choices, for your intentions, not through denying it, or not in order

18:48.120 --> 18:55.120
to deny it.

18:55.120 --> 19:02.880
Actually, must think of the being, I think that everything or intention, everything is

19:02.880 --> 19:03.880
actually arising.

19:03.880 --> 19:11.560
Well, not everything, just whatever is present at the moment, like the present intentions

19:11.560 --> 19:16.600
and present general situation, that's what's important, easy stops, thinking, oh, everything

19:16.600 --> 19:20.560
is everything, is that all that means you're falling onto a view, that everything is intentional

19:20.560 --> 19:25.200
and everything is like this, or everything is like that, and everything is not myself.

19:25.200 --> 19:30.200
But that leaves a particular intention in general, in particular sort of order of things,

19:30.200 --> 19:34.920
you don't see, because you're thinking about your view of everything and everything, you

19:34.920 --> 19:36.920
see what I mean?

19:36.920 --> 19:42.560
The difference is, your particular intentions and your particular situation should be your

19:42.560 --> 19:50.600
foundation, not the view that everything is intentional and everything is not self.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.640
So you can't think everything is intentional and everything is not self, if you're already

19:54.640 --> 20:00.000
anchored in your present situation, like general situation, in particular, intentions to

20:00.000 --> 20:08.200
think certain views, well, everything is starting, where you are just saying that everything

20:08.200 --> 20:09.200
is starting.

20:09.200 --> 20:13.120
The intentions are, I think, from general...

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
Intentions are...

20:14.120 --> 20:19.600
Okay, that's simply, they're sort of channel directed by the general situation, then within

20:19.600 --> 20:23.600
that you can have more particular intentions, but that's all because general situation is

20:23.600 --> 20:24.600
still there.

20:24.600 --> 20:30.240
If the general situation changes, the particular set of it, intention will have to change

20:30.240 --> 20:31.240
as well.

20:31.240 --> 20:39.760
I think that before we ask about the support of some people, even when they stay in the

20:39.760 --> 20:48.000
temple, sometimes they get, like, not so whole, something important, how it arises

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
all day?

20:49.000 --> 20:54.280
Well, when I say general situation, when I give a similar that slope, don't mistake that

20:54.280 --> 20:56.920
for external circumstances.

20:56.920 --> 21:06.040
It can be prompted by that, but it corresponds more correctly to moods that people are in.

21:06.040 --> 21:10.760
Happy mood, sad mood, depressed mood, fearful mood, non fearful mood, the elated mood,

21:10.760 --> 21:17.480
well, exactly, that's all the channeling, your intentions, your thoughts, your decisions,

21:17.480 --> 21:22.000
you're in a bad mood, you don't like anybody that day, you're in a good mood, you like

21:22.000 --> 21:26.520
everyone, you can get bad news, you want effect because you're in a good mood, but the

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
moods change.

21:27.520 --> 21:34.200
The general situation you've rooted in changes, and when that changes, then your particular

21:34.200 --> 21:39.560
response changes as well, so you have to learn, well, you have to start seeing the impermanence

21:39.560 --> 21:46.440
of the moods, of the way that you mean that the general situation is where your mood

21:46.440 --> 21:47.440
is.

21:47.440 --> 21:54.040
That's what Harvey gave us talking about, he said that the designs, the more general mode

21:54.040 --> 21:56.320
of being is a mood.

21:56.320 --> 22:01.600
That's your first relationship with the world, mood, but when I say first, I mean structurally

22:01.600 --> 22:06.800
first, not linear, not temporally first, doesn't mean 1, 2, 3, but your mood is at the

22:06.800 --> 22:12.680
same time there when your particular intentions and actions are there, but it comes first

22:12.680 --> 22:19.000
in terms of comes before, and that's already a form of relating with the world, interacting

22:19.000 --> 22:23.280
with the world, because you're in a bad mood because of something, or you're in a good

22:23.280 --> 22:27.720
mood, well, maybe because of nothing in particular, but it's still a form of relationship with

22:27.720 --> 22:32.880
the world, which means that that mood, that situation you're in, will be determined

22:32.880 --> 22:37.600
in your particular intentions, so you become mindful of that, you are mindful automatically

22:37.600 --> 22:43.400
of whatever you do particularly, and in return, through developing that mindfulness, you

22:43.400 --> 22:48.480
will be less and less affected by your own moods, and the less you're affected by

22:48.480 --> 22:54.800
your own moods, the less of moods they are, supple some people at least, supple ten

22:54.800 --> 23:00.720
people stay in the same situation, supple in the same trace, extremely, externally it

23:00.720 --> 23:05.720
looks the same, but internally, their mood situation might be very different, they might

23:05.720 --> 23:11.000
have different reasons there doing it, different motivation, it affects them differently, which

23:11.000 --> 23:15.280
means their mood will be different, their minds will be at different stage, at different

23:15.280 --> 23:16.280
level.

23:16.280 --> 23:23.160
Yeah, being in a different way, not even just being in a different way, supple in the

23:23.160 --> 23:29.960
temples, supple ten monks a year, but at least while they're doing something they

23:29.960 --> 23:36.080
might not be having some, like, a wholesome thought, but the general situation is the same

23:36.080 --> 23:37.080
in the temple, right?

23:37.080 --> 23:43.120
Well, again, general situation is not the external circumstances of the temple, it's

23:43.120 --> 23:48.560
the general situation of them wanting to be in the temple for various reasons that they

23:48.560 --> 23:51.360
came to the temple.

23:51.360 --> 23:55.840
So general situation, as much as particular situation for the mental is actually rooted

23:55.840 --> 24:02.640
in you, in your actions, in your intentions, not in the world, obviously the monastery

24:02.640 --> 24:06.960
will offer certain intentionality as well, things that are there amongst them, but again,

24:06.960 --> 24:11.080
all of that is experienced internally, so you can't say, oh, they're all in the same

24:11.080 --> 24:13.800
situation, why did they react differently?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.440
They're not.

24:15.440 --> 24:19.640
You're in your own situation, that's all you can know about, then you can see that somewhere

24:19.640 --> 24:24.640
else is in a bad mood, or good mood, or in different mood, and you can say, ah, there

24:24.640 --> 24:29.640
is a bad mood externally, there is a good mood externally, there is a depression externally,

24:29.640 --> 24:33.440
there is a depression internally, if you're depressed or not.

24:33.440 --> 24:37.960
So you can see these things, but again, it's all in relation to the mind, not in relation

24:37.960 --> 24:43.240
to the things, not in relation to the objects of buildings or whatever else, how each person

24:43.240 --> 24:44.240
reacts differently?

24:44.240 --> 24:51.800
Well, the situation, the roots in situation, they can be experiencing the same things, but

24:51.800 --> 25:00.040
if their mind is rooted in different mood, so to speak, they will be acting differently,

25:00.040 --> 25:06.240
or they will be acting for different reasons, or they will be intending different things,

25:06.240 --> 25:10.440
although it externally looks the same, it's done for different reasons, which means

25:10.440 --> 25:14.000
it's a different thing.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.480
So it's not necessarily that somebody is making also offerings, ah, he's a very nice

25:17.480 --> 25:20.560
person, because he might be doing it for bad reasons.

25:20.560 --> 25:27.000
Obviously, he still will have some benefit from making offerings anyhow, it's not ideal,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.440
but it's better than not doing it, but if you really want to do it properly, you want

25:31.440 --> 25:37.840
to make them and do it for the right reasons.

25:37.840 --> 25:48.920
We would explain that the general situation means the praise, no see, when you say situation

25:48.920 --> 25:53.680
means the place, you lead yourself out, and then you try to introduce yourself into

25:53.680 --> 25:59.240
that situation, and see how can you react differently based on the same situation, but

25:59.240 --> 26:04.240
That's a mistake because actually you can't separate yourself from the situation in the first place.

26:04.240 --> 26:10.240
So when you say situation is the place, no. You have to say situation is me being in a certain place.

26:10.240 --> 26:14.240
Always. You can't leave yourself out.

26:14.240 --> 26:19.240
So me being in the monastery, you being in the monastery, can you be in the monastery?

26:19.240 --> 26:25.240
Anybody being in the monastery, they have a thing that is in common to it, which is being in the monastery.

26:25.240 --> 26:32.240
But the me part is different to all of us, because we came for different reasons.

26:32.240 --> 26:37.240
It can be the same if we are here for the same reasons.

26:37.240 --> 26:44.240
But you can't just focus on the place, because place without you is meaningless. It's not a move.

26:44.240 --> 26:48.240
You mean that the situation means you mean that there is no place.

26:48.240 --> 26:55.240
It means how you feel in a certain place, where your mind is in a certain place.

26:55.240 --> 27:02.240
Generally. Then based on that, you will be making and doing particular actions and choices.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.240
How do I feel?

27:05.240 --> 27:12.240
It means even the five, six people a year, each person is feeling different.

27:12.240 --> 27:19.240
Their situation has things in common. But it's not the same. It doesn't come from the world.

27:19.240 --> 27:24.240
You can't say, are they all in the same place and they are different? No, they are not.

27:24.240 --> 27:28.240
Their places correspond by having in common that they are all in the monastery.

27:28.240 --> 27:35.240
But the internal aspect of it, me, my mood, my mind, my feelings, that's unique to all of the aggregates individually.

27:35.240 --> 27:41.240
Which is why there is difference between individuals, even in terms of arrangements.

27:41.240 --> 27:48.240
So you can't separate yourself and think that the place is the situation and then try to explain it to yourself back.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.240
You are already there. Already connected.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.240
Yes, you are part of it. You are inseparable from it.

27:54.240 --> 27:59.240
It just wouldn't make any, it would be inconceivable to think you are part from it.

27:59.240 --> 28:04.240
Unless it's based on a mistake.

28:04.240 --> 28:08.240
It means that the mood, that is a general situation.

28:08.240 --> 28:17.240
Yes, because the mood is, you know, I can be in a bad mood, but particularly I can be doing good things.

28:17.240 --> 28:25.240
If I don't allow myself to be moved by my bad mood, generally the bad mood is there.

28:25.240 --> 28:30.240
And it's kind of directing me, so I might be doing good things because I want to counter my bad mood.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.240
It's still that's prompted by my bad mood.

28:33.240 --> 28:38.240
So that that general slope is there and then I'm kind of going down it and choosing things.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.240
So you can always choose wholesome on a kind of unwholesome.

28:41.240 --> 28:48.240
Even if you are in the worst possible mood, there is never justification for unwholesome.

28:48.240 --> 28:54.240
So then when the mood changes, your particular thing might change or might not, if you have enough wisdom.

28:54.240 --> 29:00.240
If you develop enough wisdom to keep choosing wholesome over unwholesome, keep attending wholesome thoughts over unwholesome,

29:00.240 --> 29:09.240
despite how you feel, how much pull you experience, how much bad influence you get from the world or whatever.

29:09.240 --> 29:13.240
If you choose to do bad, it's because you chose to do bad.

29:13.240 --> 29:20.240
You chose that to be the reason for your bad action or you chose that to be a good reason for your good action.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.240
You're always responsible.

29:22.240 --> 29:28.240
No matter how bad the mood is, you are always responsible, but it is important to start seeing it first.

29:28.240 --> 29:33.240
Because if you don't see the general background of your mood, of the direction your mind is in,

29:33.240 --> 29:37.240
you will not see a responsibility in regard to that.

29:37.240 --> 29:42.240
You'll just be moved, so you have people who, when they're in the bad mood, they say things to be.

29:42.240 --> 29:46.240
They say that when they offend people, they help people, then they feel bad afterwards.

29:46.240 --> 29:51.240
When they kind of come out of the bad mood, they apologize, I'll never do that again.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.240
Then they do it again.

29:52.240 --> 29:58.240
Then your people, when they're in a good mood, they're so excited, ecstatic, they get a bit too much.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.240
Then afterwards they feel a bit shameful off.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.240
I've got to be carried away.

30:02.240 --> 30:07.240
Because they're not aware of the general situation, of the general direction of their mood,

30:07.240 --> 30:14.240
which means they're not being aware, they don't have a safeguard, so they're always taken by it.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.240
And that's what the mindfulness is.

30:17.240 --> 30:23.240
Before you explain that the mountain and that the shruff and that already included means that the mood,

30:23.240 --> 30:25.240
that itself has a mood.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.240
It's not something like...

30:28.240 --> 30:32.240
No, no, no, the actual location.

30:32.240 --> 30:35.240
So that is the reason that some people, even when they stay in the temple,

30:35.240 --> 30:37.240
that their mood is not not good.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.240
That's the reason.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.240
They can be sitting by next to the Buddha and still.

30:42.240 --> 30:47.240
Yeah, there were cases like in December of the Buddha, but they were just not.

30:47.240 --> 30:49.240
The mind wouldn't be there.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.240
And they say, well, you're wasting your opportunity.

30:52.240 --> 30:57.240
But yeah, it doesn't necessarily mean that, like going to a place that the temple can't remind you,

30:57.240 --> 31:02.240
oh, well, it can remind you if you were to know what you're supposed to do.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.240
So if you were to know that you're supposed to be mindful of your moods

31:06.240 --> 31:09.240
and take responsibility for your choices,

31:09.240 --> 31:15.240
then going to a monastery or even the sutras can't remind you of that when you forget.

31:15.240 --> 31:19.240
But if you don't know that in the first place, well, no amount of visits to the monastery

31:19.240 --> 31:23.240
will make a difference because you can't be reminded of something that you don't know.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.240
So you'll probably get different things than in the monastery.

31:26.240 --> 31:31.240
And people will go for different reasons to a monastery, superstition or whatever.

31:31.240 --> 31:35.240
Usually is a superstition, regardless of the religion as well.

31:35.240 --> 31:41.240
But it's Buddhism or Christianity, so usually that's the reason why people go to churches and so on.

31:41.240 --> 31:47.240
It's quite hard after to maintain mindfulness that with the thinking I would consider the background.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.240
Well, because you're trying to maintain mindfulness in a particular sense,

31:50.240 --> 31:52.240
you're trying to keep it in front of you.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.240
But that's not mindfulness.

31:54.240 --> 31:59.240
Mindfulness is knowing the background without interfering with it.

31:59.240 --> 32:03.240
So if I ask you now, are you in a good or a bad mood, you will know the answer.

32:03.240 --> 32:08.240
You might not be able to define it specifically, but you will know it's all right,

32:08.240 --> 32:10.240
or no one more too good.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.240
And that knowledge is already there.

32:12.240 --> 32:17.240
It is not only to see the phrase, but not that, that it's a mood that I have to see.

32:17.240 --> 32:21.240
Well, the fact that you can give me the answer to what your mood is at any time

32:21.240 --> 32:23.240
means that knowledge is there at any time.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.240
Or the superstition is important.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.240
Yeah, so that's something you can be mindful of.

32:27.240 --> 32:31.240
Only that is necessary to be mindful of, nothing else.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.240
Before I remember, you said that I'm sitting in the cave,

32:34.240 --> 32:36.240
could he and something, something?

32:36.240 --> 32:38.240
You were explaining about the situation.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.240
Is it increasing the mood or is it increasing?

32:40.240 --> 32:41.240
I am sitting.

32:41.240 --> 32:42.240
I am doing.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.240
I am.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.240
Means, yeah.

32:44.240 --> 32:49.240
Means, basically, you are in such a such situation, which means your mood is there.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.240
So is it important to see that I am sitting in the cave?

32:52.240 --> 32:53.240
Is it important?

32:53.240 --> 32:56.240
No, that was just the example I gave you as a more general situation.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.240
Like, I am in the monastery now.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.240
You can be mindful of that.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.240
Or you can be mindful of, I am.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.240
I am feeling elated now.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.240
Or I am feeling depressed now.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.240
Again, I can such a fatara so that when the Buddha refers to the mind,

33:09.240 --> 33:13.240
he says, he knows mind, like literally for what it is.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.240
He knows elated mind as elated mind.

33:15.240 --> 33:18.240
He knows depressed mind as depressed mind.

33:18.240 --> 33:21.240
Happy mind as happy, expanded mind, shrunk mind.

33:21.240 --> 33:24.240
Like different shapes the mind can take.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.240
He knows them.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.240
But that's it.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.240
So you're not trying to change it or whatever.

33:28.240 --> 33:33.240
You just are. The mind is in that state, which means it will be affecting my particular choices.

33:33.240 --> 33:37.240
So if the mind is in the pressed mood, you're mindful of it.

33:37.240 --> 33:41.240
You will be more aware of the choices you make, which means you will not be making bad choices,

33:41.240 --> 33:46.240
because you know that the mind will be trying to get you to make the bad choices,

33:46.240 --> 33:48.240
because the mind is depressed.

33:48.240 --> 33:53.240
In the same sense, when the mind is happy, you won't be overreaching in terms of your great choices,

33:53.240 --> 33:57.240
because you know, the mind is elated, which means the perspective is a bit lost.

33:57.240 --> 34:03.240
So you won't have the mind even, but like even another hand will practice mindfulness

34:03.240 --> 34:06.240
in terms of the different shapes his mind will take.

34:06.240 --> 34:11.240
It's just that he completely, completely saved any bond with that mind or with the body.

34:11.240 --> 34:15.240
So whichever shape his mind takes, it doesn't affect him.

34:15.240 --> 34:17.240
And so he's gone beyond.

34:17.240 --> 34:20.240
But until that's the case, you need to keep that mind.

34:20.240 --> 34:24.240
Because if you're only aware of mindful what's in front of you,

34:24.240 --> 34:27.240
means you're not seeing your mind, because your mind is never in front of you.

34:27.240 --> 34:29.240
It's always in the back.

34:29.240 --> 34:32.240
Why do we see situations in front of you?

34:32.240 --> 34:35.240
Well, if you're seeing situation in front of you, that's not your situation anymore.

34:35.240 --> 34:39.240
Situation is where the mind is, which is always in the background.

34:39.240 --> 34:42.240
Mood is where the mind is, which is always in the background.

34:42.240 --> 34:48.240
But if you try to see it in front of you, it means whatever you're seeing in front of you is not the background.

34:48.240 --> 34:53.240
Even if it was the background before, the faith that you put it in front means something else is now.

34:53.240 --> 35:00.240
It means only has to keep seeing the mood, the mental state.

35:00.240 --> 35:04.240
Well, you have to keep seeing the relationship between the two.

35:04.240 --> 35:10.240
You have to keep seeing the mood, the mental state, and the relationship between your particular situation,

35:10.240 --> 35:13.240
like particular choices you make.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.240
Means this intention?

35:15.240 --> 35:18.240
Means things I'm about to do based on how I feel.

35:18.240 --> 35:23.240
To put it simply, yeah.

35:23.240 --> 35:25.240
I feel bad, I feel neutral.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.240
What am I doing right now?

35:27.240 --> 35:30.240
Because whatever you do actually is rooted in how you feel.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.240
Body-feeling?

35:32.240 --> 35:36.240
No, there's no feelings, those are all perceptions.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.240
Like, each is a perception.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.240
You might dislike your reach.

35:42.240 --> 35:47.240
So experience this pleasure in your mind on account of the body-lead.

35:47.240 --> 35:52.240
But it's not that you're experiencing this pleasure in your body as a sensation.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.240
No, that's just the perception of touch.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.240
Pain is feeling, is it?

35:57.240 --> 35:59.240
Pain is feeling, yes.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.240
Pain is perception.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.240
Yeah.

36:02.240 --> 36:09.240
So each can be painful, or sometimes each can be pleasant, depending on whatever people are interested.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.240
Pain, nothing you say, that I'm present.

36:11.240 --> 36:14.240
Yeah, pain is I'm present.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.240
Every feeling is mental.

36:16.240 --> 36:21.240
And people misunderstand, they think, because when they say that, they're bodily feelings,

36:21.240 --> 36:24.240
but he said their feelings caused in regard to the body.

36:24.240 --> 36:28.240
So people misunderstand that and use that to explain sensation.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.240
That's my bodily feeling.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.240
No, it's not.

36:30.240 --> 36:34.240
Every feeling is chetastic, it's a parallel.

36:34.240 --> 36:37.240
It's mental.

36:37.240 --> 36:41.240
So if it's in regard to the body, then it's called bodily feeling.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.240
But it's still a mental feeling.

36:43.240 --> 36:47.240
If it's in regard to the mind, then it's kind of doubly mental feeling.

36:47.240 --> 36:52.240
But either if you're feeling being in regard to body, it's mental in itself.

36:52.240 --> 36:56.240
So as I said, when you have a bodily itch, bodily discomfort,

36:56.240 --> 37:01.240
you will most likely experience mentally, unpleasant feeling.

37:01.240 --> 37:05.240
But it's not that unpleasant feeling is in your leg.

37:05.240 --> 37:12.240
It's a very sharp sensation of severed leg, and a kind of almost unbearable pain mentally.

37:12.240 --> 37:20.240
But if you're mentally free from that pain, that discomfort ceases to cause you suffering.

37:20.240 --> 37:27.240
So that's why I like the arrangements were the minds developed in terms of genres,

37:27.240 --> 37:31.240
and they could bear a lot of physical discomfort.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.240
It wouldn't be discomfort for them.

37:33.240 --> 37:36.240
It's just the way the mind relates to it.

37:36.240 --> 37:42.240
When the Buddha asked Mahakasava said, you're very old now, you've done what is to be done.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.240
Why don't you come with me?

37:44.240 --> 37:46.240
I get lots of offerings.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.240
I get silk robes, staying in these palaces.

37:48.240 --> 37:53.240
So you can come and stay with me because there's no need for you to be living rough in the forest.

37:53.240 --> 37:58.240
And he said, oh, there's no need, Lord, because whoever can obtain genres it will.

37:58.240 --> 38:05.240
Like these reg ropes and these forests will feel like the softest, highest, most pleasant dwellings and abiding.

38:05.240 --> 38:10.240
Because that's how it feels to the mind that it's trained in genres.

38:10.240 --> 38:14.240
And then another case when the Buddha was instructing a very long rule of it,

38:14.240 --> 38:20.240
when he said, develop genres so that the hemp robes you're wearing will feel like silk.

38:20.240 --> 38:28.240
Develop genres so that the sleeping under the root of tree will feel like sleeping in a plastered palace.

38:28.240 --> 38:35.240
And then develop genres so that the rough hemp robes, like unclean rice you eat,

38:35.240 --> 38:40.240
would feel like the softest rice with the nicest caries.

38:40.240 --> 38:43.240
And then it was for medicine and so on.

38:43.240 --> 38:49.240
Saying basically that the mind state, the mind development will determine your relationship with your body.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.240
So the body is going through discomfort.

38:52.240 --> 38:58.240
Well, whether usually discomfort is associated with pain, mental pain.

38:58.240 --> 39:01.240
So if there is no discomfort, there is no pain.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.240
Associated with mental pain?

39:03.240 --> 39:05.240
Yeah, experiencing suffering in regard to discomfort.

39:05.240 --> 39:08.240
Everybody dislikes discomfort.

39:08.240 --> 39:13.240
But if you develop your mind means less and less things will be discomfortable to you.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.240
I'm comfortable.

39:15.240 --> 39:17.240
I'm comfortable.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.240
How do they have unpleasant feelings?

39:19.240 --> 39:22.240
They do. Yeah, taking stuff.

39:22.240 --> 39:25.240
So arahant can be an arahant without being mastered all of the genres.

39:25.240 --> 39:31.240
So that's why you had arahants who were in great pain physically experiencing sharp piercings,

39:31.240 --> 39:35.240
sensations, piercings, perceptions on a counter grid.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.240
But they were not suffering internally.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.240
There was no duke.

39:39.240 --> 39:43.240
But it's just that their relationship with the body was kind of unbearable and pointless.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.240
Because they were arahants.

39:45.240 --> 39:48.240
They had no reason to endure all of those sharp discomfort.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.240
But discomfort in itself is not actually painful.

39:51.240 --> 39:57.240
It's the mental resistance in regard to it that makes you suffer on account of discomfort.

39:57.240 --> 40:00.240
It makes you fear discomfort.

40:00.240 --> 40:04.240
It makes you really work hard to not experience discomfort.

40:04.240 --> 40:09.240
I mean, how do they feel unpleasant feelings but no suffering?

40:09.240 --> 40:12.240
Well, I would be speaking.

40:12.240 --> 40:16.240
Like you can't say that because if you say for protrusion that he feels unpleasant feelings,

40:16.240 --> 40:19.240
you can't use the same designation for an arahant.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.240
Because from protrusion point of view, arahant doesn't have any feelings anymore.

40:22.240 --> 40:24.240
He has overcome them.

40:24.240 --> 40:29.240
And the fact that he doesn't feel anything anymore, that's what's pleasant for him.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.240
And that's what the Sariputu said.

40:32.240 --> 40:43.240
So you have to distinguish the bodily discomfort from pain, from displeasure, from duke.

40:43.240 --> 40:49.240
Because being able to bear this discomfort, that's why sometimes it's necessary.

40:49.240 --> 40:52.240
That's why for some people a satis is a woodwork.

40:52.240 --> 40:57.240
It will make them see things rightly, not for everyone, but for some people it would.

40:57.240 --> 41:02.240
Which is why the Buddha said, well, if you agreed aversion and delusion decreases

41:02.240 --> 41:05.240
while doing a satis practices, then do it.

41:05.240 --> 41:07.240
If it's not decreasing, then don't do it.

41:07.240 --> 41:12.240
But yes, some people do need to go through discomfort in order to start to see the difference.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.240
The discomfort is not automatically a pain.

41:15.240 --> 41:20.240
It's your mental resistance that makes yourself and makes you confuse it.

41:20.240 --> 41:24.240
So by overcoming that, you overcome discomfort and then you don't fear it.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.240
And as the Buddha did, he was the Buddha.

41:27.240 --> 41:32.240
So he didn't have to pursue discomfort anymore, what for?

41:32.240 --> 41:34.240
Either way, he was not affected by it.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.240
So he would just go wherever he was.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.240
Sometimes he would sleep on a stack of hay, under the tree.

41:39.240 --> 41:43.240
Sometimes he would sleep in a king's palace, if that's where he was at the time,

41:43.240 --> 41:45.240
going behind it or whatever else.

41:45.240 --> 41:52.240
So it's not the external things will determine necessarily what it's good or bad.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.240
It's basically your attitude in regard to it.

41:55.240 --> 42:00.240
But sometimes people can go and live roughly in the forest and under the root of tree

42:00.240 --> 42:03.240
for completely wrong reasons.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.240
They don't see this difference, they address torture in themselves and thinking

42:06.240 --> 42:10.240
the true torture, they will be developing purification and strength.

42:10.240 --> 42:15.240
But they want, they have developed endurance, but misguided endurance.

42:15.240 --> 42:18.240
So the endurance has to be ruined to the right view.

42:18.240 --> 42:21.240
Well, anything has to be ruined to the right view, you know, to be right.

42:21.240 --> 42:25.240
Which is why a person shouldn't go to a forest and start experiencing themselves

42:25.240 --> 42:31.240
unless it's a sort of a, unless he has genres, unless other establishments have been made,

42:31.240 --> 42:33.240
as the Buddha said.

42:33.240 --> 42:36.240
So you just end up doing it for unwholesome reasons.

42:36.240 --> 42:39.240
And your answer is actually very difficult point under some,

42:39.240 --> 42:42.240
because sometimes I feel that because of a self view that's try to go against,

42:42.240 --> 42:45.240
like try to change the teams.

42:45.240 --> 42:50.240
That is actually based on the self view that they're going to see.

42:50.240 --> 42:55.240
Well, like again, even if it is based on the self view, it's really less such.

42:55.240 --> 43:00.240
So if you have a thought of wanting to change things, that's something you include in your mindfulness.

43:00.240 --> 43:04.240
Even if it came from yourself, from the mistake of yourself or not,

43:04.240 --> 43:07.240
it's real as such. It's there. You just experienced it.

43:07.240 --> 43:10.240
It's your mindful of that.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.240
So you don't divide out this came from this. That's okay.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.240
It's came from another one. No.

43:14.240 --> 43:18.240
Whatever your experience, it's real as that experience.

43:18.240 --> 43:21.240
Even if it's an abstract experience of something that you've never seen,

43:21.240 --> 43:24.240
they start to, you're experienced it in your mind as such,

43:24.240 --> 43:27.240
and it's real in that way.

43:27.240 --> 43:31.240
So if you're having resistance in regard to endurance,

43:31.240 --> 43:34.240
that's part of the endurance.

43:34.240 --> 43:36.240
If you have thoughts of resisting this,

43:36.240 --> 43:38.240
that's all result of you enduring.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.240
So you're just included in endurance.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.240
Are not they endurance?

43:42.240 --> 43:44.240
Are not can endure.

43:44.240 --> 43:48.240
But Argo wants to suffer on account of his endurance.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.240
He won't fear the endurance.

43:51.240 --> 43:54.240
He won't try to avoid it.

43:54.240 --> 43:57.240
If he comes, he comes. If he doesn't, he doesn't.

43:57.240 --> 44:01.240
He won't try to avoid it, but he won't go after it either.

44:01.240 --> 44:04.240
Because he has no need for it.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.240
For puttu, you know, this is enduring sometimes,

44:07.240 --> 44:09.240
that the suffering that you've been involved in.

44:09.240 --> 44:12.240
Again, it needs to be done for the whole some reasons.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.240
Like puttu, you know, I can endure a lot.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.240
You know, there are people setting yourself on fire,

44:17.240 --> 44:19.240
complete misguided puttu,

44:19.240 --> 44:21.240
it's for ridiculous political reasons.

44:21.240 --> 44:24.240
Like how dumb is that?

44:24.240 --> 44:25.240
Complete misguided.

44:25.240 --> 44:29.240
Yet it's extreme for endurance and people do it.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.240
And that means nothing.

44:31.240 --> 44:34.240
But if somebody would endure very little for the right reasons,

44:34.240 --> 44:37.240
he would reap much more benefit.

44:37.240 --> 44:41.240
So if you endure, because the endurance has a reason,

44:41.240 --> 44:44.240
because you don't go after it,

44:44.240 --> 44:46.240
nor do you run away from it,

44:46.240 --> 44:48.240
nor do you do anything on account of it,

44:48.240 --> 44:51.240
that's already more awesome.

44:51.240 --> 44:53.240
Then you can know endurance for what it is,

44:53.240 --> 44:55.240
or lack of it for what it is,

44:55.240 --> 44:58.240
or need of development for what it is.

44:58.240 --> 45:01.240
You won't be running away from it,

45:01.240 --> 45:04.240
because sometimes people get really into enduring

45:04.240 --> 45:06.240
as a form of running away from it.

45:06.240 --> 45:08.240
I fear this, so I'm going to go and face it,

45:08.240 --> 45:10.240
because I'm terrified of it.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.240
And then they end up torturing themselves

45:12.240 --> 45:16.240
as if that will kind of make them overcome the fear.

45:16.240 --> 45:18.240
If there is any wisdom in regard to it,

45:18.240 --> 45:19.240
it might help them,

45:19.240 --> 45:21.240
like putting themselves through rough situations,

45:21.240 --> 45:22.240
it might help them,

45:22.240 --> 45:24.240
if there is a wisdom basis.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.240
But if there isn't,

45:25.240 --> 45:29.240
it will just make them overcome around the same issue.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.240
Something actually even fail.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.240
Even fail, we don't do anything.

45:33.240 --> 45:35.240
Automatically,

45:35.240 --> 45:37.240
all these stuff moving,

45:37.240 --> 45:39.240
and sometimes it's quite interesting,

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
sometimes it's just sitting,

45:40.240 --> 45:42.240
and not thinking to the anything.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.240
Automatically, all these stuff moving,

45:44.240 --> 45:46.240
they're doing, they're thinking.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
Yeah, exactly.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.240
I would have said,

45:48.240 --> 45:49.240
you know, it's all happening,

45:49.240 --> 45:55.240
but it's something ready to begin to be one.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.240
Well, it's basically, as I said,

45:57.240 --> 46:01.240
the body doesn't need self-tooperate.

46:01.240 --> 46:04.240
Intentions don't need self-tooperate.

46:04.240 --> 46:07.240
So they've been operating on their own

46:07.240 --> 46:09.240
before, for protruding now,

46:09.240 --> 46:11.240
or after, for an around.

46:11.240 --> 46:13.240
The problem is,

46:13.240 --> 46:17.240
protruding first needs to accept the responsibility for yourself,

46:17.240 --> 46:19.240
which is done through developing mindfulness

46:19.240 --> 46:21.240
in regard to body and whatever else.

46:21.240 --> 46:24.240
Actions, choices, specifically.

46:24.240 --> 46:27.240
And then, through accepting the responsibility,

46:27.240 --> 46:29.240
you can eventually reach the point

46:29.240 --> 46:30.240
when you just see, oh yeah,

46:30.240 --> 46:33.240
the intentionality doesn't require sense of self.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.240
It's all operating.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.240
But if you start doing it before,

46:36.240 --> 46:37.240
you fully accept responsibility,

46:37.240 --> 46:38.240
then it will more,

46:38.240 --> 46:40.240
be like, more forgetfulness.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.240
You forgot to be mindful,

46:41.240 --> 46:43.240
and yeah, the body is just doing things.

46:43.240 --> 46:45.240
But that's all rooted in our awesome,

46:45.240 --> 46:47.240
because of the self-view.

46:47.240 --> 46:50.240
So, other hands,

46:50.240 --> 46:53.240
forgetfulness, so to speak,

46:53.240 --> 46:55.240
is different from the forget,

46:55.240 --> 46:57.240
like, other hands, forgetfulness,

46:57.240 --> 46:59.240
will not induce self-view,

46:59.240 --> 47:01.240
will not induce a region,

47:01.240 --> 47:02.240
which means, basically,

47:02.240 --> 47:04.240
it's not really forgetfulness.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.240
But for protruding,

47:05.240 --> 47:06.240
and with yeast, forgetfulness,

47:06.240 --> 47:08.240
you forget all the way.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.240
Yeah, I know.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.240
And that's how the region,

47:11.240 --> 47:12.240
ignorance,

47:12.240 --> 47:13.240
is maintained.

47:13.240 --> 47:14.240
I am fully, fully,

47:14.240 --> 47:15.240
I got just simply,

47:15.240 --> 47:16.240
it was not...

47:16.240 --> 47:18.240
Well, so to speak,

47:18.240 --> 47:19.240
but the thing is,

47:19.240 --> 47:21.240
like, if you are forgetfulness,

47:21.240 --> 47:23.240
it's not inducing a region.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.240
I mean, you are mindful

47:24.240 --> 47:26.240
of you being forgetful.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.240
So, you might be forgetful

47:27.240 --> 47:29.240
in terms of particular things,

47:29.240 --> 47:30.240
or I forgot the number,

47:30.240 --> 47:31.240
or something,

47:31.240 --> 47:32.240
but I didn't forget the nature of forgetting.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.240
I'm mindful of that.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.240
That's why the garhant mindfulness

47:36.240 --> 47:37.240
is so fully developed.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.240
And he can't stop doing it.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.240
So, to speak, he's always mindful

47:40.240 --> 47:41.240
in that sense.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.240
But he's not always mindful

47:42.240 --> 47:44.240
in a sense of contemporary repersonal

47:44.240 --> 47:45.240
like touching, moving,

47:45.240 --> 47:46.240
moving like a rover.

47:46.240 --> 47:48.240
No, means he can't forget,

47:48.240 --> 47:50.240
he's forgetfulness.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.240
Forgetfulness will not induce

47:52.240 --> 47:54.240
a region anymore for him.

47:54.240 --> 47:56.240
So, you might hear

47:56.240 --> 47:57.240
forget particular things,

47:57.240 --> 47:59.240
as an experience of forgetting,

47:59.240 --> 48:00.240
of forgetting,

48:00.240 --> 48:01.240
he's mindful of that.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.240
And that same cannot be said

48:03.240 --> 48:05.240
for protruding.

48:05.240 --> 48:08.240
Okay, sometimes even if I'm not mindful,

48:08.240 --> 48:10.240
everything is going well.

48:10.240 --> 48:11.240
Yeah.

48:11.240 --> 48:12.240
Whether you're mindful

48:12.240 --> 48:13.240
or not, things are intentional

48:13.240 --> 48:14.240
and they are going.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.240
The thing is,

48:15.240 --> 48:18.240
you do have to accept responsibility for it.

48:18.240 --> 48:20.240
Like, that's why the,

48:20.240 --> 48:22.240
that's why the situation of protrusion

48:22.240 --> 48:24.240
is kind of perilous.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.240
In a way,

48:25.240 --> 48:26.240
you're not in control of everything,

48:26.240 --> 48:28.240
or of anything,

48:28.240 --> 48:29.240
but in the same way,

48:29.240 --> 48:31.240
you're responsible for everything.

48:31.240 --> 48:32.240
So, you can't control anything,

48:32.240 --> 48:33.240
but you have full responsibility

48:33.240 --> 48:35.240
for all of it.

48:35.240 --> 48:37.240
And it's true.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.240
Because protrusion,

48:38.240 --> 48:39.240
you might say,

48:39.240 --> 48:40.240
oh well, I'm not doing this

48:40.240 --> 48:41.240
and it's just my body.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.240
The fact is,

48:42.240 --> 48:44.240
when he dies, he'll be reborn again

48:44.240 --> 48:45.240
because he's protrusioned

48:45.240 --> 48:46.240
and because of the actions,

48:46.240 --> 48:48.240
even if my body just made these actions,

48:48.240 --> 48:50.240
you will be experiencing those results

48:50.240 --> 48:53.240
because you took that body to be yours.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.240
So, in that sense,

48:54.240 --> 48:56.240
he needs to fully accept

48:56.240 --> 48:57.240
his responsibility

48:57.240 --> 48:58.240
even for accidents,

48:58.240 --> 49:00.240
even for things that are not

49:00.240 --> 49:02.240
in his control clear.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.240
And you're fully accepting

49:03.240 --> 49:04.240
the responsibility

49:04.240 --> 49:05.240
he can eventually overcome,

49:05.240 --> 49:07.240
but not before.

49:07.240 --> 49:08.240
Again,

49:08.240 --> 49:09.240
that's why the mundane

49:09.240 --> 49:11.240
right view comes first,

49:11.240 --> 49:14.240
like admitting.

49:14.240 --> 49:16.240
Are you only,

49:16.240 --> 49:17.240
he needs free from karma,

49:17.240 --> 49:19.240
or is free from karma?

49:19.240 --> 49:20.240
Yeah, well,

49:20.240 --> 49:21.240
Arya has a limited life.

49:21.240 --> 49:22.240
Really, very good.

49:22.240 --> 49:23.240
So, the sort of money

49:23.240 --> 49:24.240
is free from karma?

49:24.240 --> 49:25.240
Well, relatively.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.240
Ultimately,

49:26.240 --> 49:27.240
yes, within seven,

49:27.240 --> 49:28.240
at most,

49:28.240 --> 49:29.240
but he'll be done,

49:29.240 --> 49:31.240
but he still has

49:31.240 --> 49:33.240
kind of the wheel

49:33.240 --> 49:35.240
didn't quite stop spinning yet.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.240
But he will.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.240
He does serve you

49:38.240 --> 49:40.240
this karma.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.240
Sorry?

49:41.240 --> 49:42.240
Without serve view,

49:42.240 --> 49:43.240
that they have no

49:43.240 --> 49:44.240
no serve view,

49:44.240 --> 49:45.240
even sort of money,

49:45.240 --> 49:47.240
they don't believe in servo.

49:47.240 --> 49:48.240
Yeah, but they still have

49:48.240 --> 49:50.240
residues of conceit.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.240
Conceit, I am.

49:51.240 --> 49:52.240
Yeah, they don't have

49:52.240 --> 49:53.240
a self-view in terms of thinking

49:53.240 --> 49:54.240
themselves as living

49:54.240 --> 49:55.240
like an independent

49:55.240 --> 49:57.240
master of five aggregates.

49:57.240 --> 49:58.240
They don't have that anymore.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.240
But they still have

49:59.240 --> 50:01.240
conceit in sense of I am,

50:01.240 --> 50:02.240
and they still have degree

50:02.240 --> 50:04.240
of greedy version of delusion,

50:04.240 --> 50:05.240
because of which

50:05.240 --> 50:06.240
they will be evolving

50:06.240 --> 50:07.240
a bit longer,

50:07.240 --> 50:09.240
until they make enough effort,

50:09.240 --> 50:10.240
whether in this life or,

50:10.240 --> 50:11.240
but someone

50:11.240 --> 50:12.240
doesn't necessarily

50:12.240 --> 50:13.240
have to be born

50:13.240 --> 50:14.240
seven times.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.240
He can become

50:15.240 --> 50:16.240
out of his second

50:16.240 --> 50:17.240
lifetime,

50:17.240 --> 50:18.240
or third,

50:18.240 --> 50:19.240
or fourth or fifth,

50:19.240 --> 50:20.240
at most,

50:20.240 --> 50:21.240
seven.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.240
Yeah.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.240
For me,

50:24.240 --> 50:25.240
very difficult

50:25.240 --> 50:26.240
on this end of the first

50:26.240 --> 50:27.240
section,

50:27.240 --> 50:29.240
it's very difficult

50:29.240 --> 50:30.240
to have a whole path.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.240
Perception means

50:31.240 --> 50:33.240
a lot like a helping

50:33.240 --> 50:35.240
knowledge to arise.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.240
No, I think something like a

50:36.240 --> 50:37.240
perception means

50:37.240 --> 50:38.240
perceiving.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.240
It means things that are

50:40.240 --> 50:41.240
right.

50:41.240 --> 50:42.240
In the case of pain,

50:42.240 --> 50:43.240
the user pain is feeling.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.240
Yeah.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.240
Perception means

50:45.240 --> 50:46.240
the user there like

50:46.240 --> 50:47.240
I am.

50:47.240 --> 50:50.240
Well, what is causing the pain?

50:50.240 --> 50:52.240
There is, you can't

50:52.240 --> 50:53.240
Well, not necessarily the

50:53.240 --> 50:54.240
cause of pain,

50:54.240 --> 50:55.240
but basically perception

50:55.240 --> 50:57.240
and feeling are inseparable.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.240
You can't just

50:58.240 --> 50:59.240
perceive or just feel.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.240
Whenever you feel,

51:00.240 --> 51:01.240
you're perceiving

51:01.240 --> 51:02.240
something.

51:02.240 --> 51:03.240
Whenever you're perceiving

51:03.240 --> 51:04.240
something,

51:04.240 --> 51:06.240
you're feeling something.

51:06.240 --> 51:07.240
So, if you say,

51:07.240 --> 51:08.240
I have feeling of pain,

51:08.240 --> 51:10.240
well, there is a perception

51:10.240 --> 51:11.240
in regard to it.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.240
Usually,

51:12.240 --> 51:14.240
it's what causes your pain.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.240
Hmm.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.240
Suppose if I

51:16.240 --> 51:18.240
that's a fire.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.240
Well, that's a sharp,

51:20.240 --> 51:22.240
piercing perception.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.240
That's it.

51:23.240 --> 51:25.240
That you don't want to endure.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.240
But that's not necessarily pain.

51:27.240 --> 51:29.240
Hmm.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.240
If somebody tells you,

51:31.240 --> 51:33.240
if you touch this fire,

51:33.240 --> 51:36.240
how will, I don't know,

51:36.240 --> 51:38.240
save 500 dying children

51:38.240 --> 51:40.240
and you're going to touch the fire

51:40.240 --> 51:41.240
and you'll be very happy

51:41.240 --> 51:42.240
that you've done it.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.240
Cause you know,

51:43.240 --> 51:44.240
you save 500 lives.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.240
Hmm.

51:45.240 --> 51:46.240
So, you won't be suffering

51:46.240 --> 51:48.240
on a kind of touching the fire.

51:48.240 --> 51:49.240
Hmm.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.240
But if you want,

51:50.240 --> 51:51.240
I don't know,

51:51.240 --> 51:52.240
if you're a painter

51:52.240 --> 51:53.240
and you're part of your painting

51:53.240 --> 51:54.240
and then you burn your hand

51:54.240 --> 51:55.240
and you can't paint,

51:55.240 --> 51:57.240
you can't earn any more,

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
your family suffering,

51:58.240 --> 51:59.240
you'll be suffering a lot

51:59.240 --> 52:00.240
on a kind of touching the fire.

52:00.240 --> 52:01.240
Fire.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.240
It's the same perception,

52:02.240 --> 52:03.240
touching the fire.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.240
Oh, because it's telling you

52:05.240 --> 52:06.240
that the touching the fire.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.240
Yeah.

52:07.240 --> 52:08.240
Yeah.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.240
It's a bodily perception.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.240
You perception of touch.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.240
Hmm.

52:12.240 --> 52:14.240
You see,

52:14.240 --> 52:16.240
seeing something disagreeable.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.240
Yeah.

52:17.240 --> 52:19.240
Like you can see something disagreeable

52:19.240 --> 52:20.240
or agreeable.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.240
But you don't have to neither suffer

52:21.240 --> 52:22.240
nor be happy on a kind of it.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.240
But usually people are.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.240
Oh.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.240
I see something agreeable.

52:25.240 --> 52:26.240
I like it.

52:26.240 --> 52:27.240
I want more of it.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.240
You get very related.

52:28.240 --> 52:30.240
You see something disagreeable

52:30.240 --> 52:32.240
who I don't want to look at it.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.240
I don't like it.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.240
Hmm.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.240
And if you have no choice

52:35.240 --> 52:36.240
but to look at it,

52:36.240 --> 52:37.240
you'll start suffering.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.240
I think that if I,

52:38.240 --> 52:39.240
if I call it pain,

52:39.240 --> 52:40.240
it becomes different.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.240
Because I write a body of pain.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.240
But actually,

52:43.240 --> 52:44.240
it's just unpleasant.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
That's why,

52:45.240 --> 52:46.240
you know,

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
if you don't like it,

52:47.240 --> 52:49.240
you'll start suffering.

52:49.240 --> 52:50.240
I think that if I,

52:50.240 --> 52:52.240
that's why I was telling you,

52:52.240 --> 52:53.240
when you told me that,

52:53.240 --> 52:55.240
how getting rid of the bodily pains

52:55.240 --> 52:56.240
or whatever I said,

52:56.240 --> 52:57.240
well, that's irrelevant,

52:57.240 --> 52:58.240
in a way.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.240
Hmm.

52:59.240 --> 53:00.240
There is nothing to do

53:00.240 --> 53:01.240
to the nature of suffering,

53:01.240 --> 53:02.240
to do it.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.240
I go,

53:03.240 --> 53:04.240
I have a pain in my right arm.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.240
Well, first of all,

53:05.240 --> 53:06.240
it's not in your right arm.

53:06.240 --> 53:08.240
It's discomfort in your right arm.

53:08.240 --> 53:09.240
On a counter,

53:09.240 --> 53:11.240
which your mind is bothered.

53:11.240 --> 53:13.240
But if you think the pain is in your right arm,

53:13.240 --> 53:15.240
then fixing your right arm,

53:15.240 --> 53:17.240
will feel like you fixed your pain.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.240
Which means you're actually trying

53:19.240 --> 53:21.240
to fix your dukkha

53:21.240 --> 53:23.240
at a completely wrong domain.

53:23.240 --> 53:24.240
You're trying to,

53:24.240 --> 53:26.240
and lots of meditation

53:26.240 --> 53:27.240
that people teach

53:27.240 --> 53:28.240
is about that,

53:28.240 --> 53:30.240
or observing the sensations

53:30.240 --> 53:31.240
and feeling your body like this,

53:31.240 --> 53:32.240
and if it feels tight,

53:32.240 --> 53:33.240
you lose it.

53:33.240 --> 53:34.240
It's actually relevant

53:34.240 --> 53:36.240
in every possible way.

53:36.240 --> 53:38.240
How do you see that,

53:38.240 --> 53:39.240
what's the reason?

53:39.240 --> 53:40.240
Where am I?

53:40.240 --> 53:41.240
Where am I supposed to make it?

53:41.240 --> 53:42.240
It could not be more.

53:42.240 --> 53:43.240
I, I, I think,

53:43.240 --> 53:44.240
before.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.240
Yeah, it could not be more.

53:45.240 --> 53:46.240
It's guided.

53:46.240 --> 53:48.240
It's completely misprojected.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.240
It's exactly what I'm saying just now.

53:50.240 --> 53:52.240
Like, you, you, you, you're looking

53:52.240 --> 53:53.240
at a completely wrong place

53:53.240 --> 53:55.240
for a solution to the problem of suffering.

53:55.240 --> 53:56.240
Many people believe

53:56.240 --> 53:58.240
going to Arhant or whatever.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.240
Well, yeah.

53:59.240 --> 54:01.240
People believe in various things.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.240
The reason why,

54:02.240 --> 54:03.240
why people feel it works,

54:03.240 --> 54:05.240
is because

54:05.240 --> 54:07.240
most of people they do it,

54:07.240 --> 54:10.240
are lay people with very busy lives,

54:10.240 --> 54:11.240
and then,

54:11.240 --> 54:12.240
you never really stop,

54:12.240 --> 54:13.240
you never really reflect,

54:13.240 --> 54:15.240
you don't really have any right views,

54:15.240 --> 54:17.240
so then you go to a place

54:17.240 --> 54:18.240
of an intensive retreat,

54:18.240 --> 54:19.240
controlled retreat,

54:19.240 --> 54:20.240
but every moment,

54:20.240 --> 54:21.240
it's kind of tacky,

54:21.240 --> 54:22.240
tacky, tacky,

54:22.240 --> 54:23.240
you do this,

54:23.240 --> 54:24.240
you do this,

54:24.240 --> 54:25.240
you do this, you watch,

54:25.240 --> 54:26.240
you watch,

54:26.240 --> 54:27.240
and it almost feels like a release.

54:27.240 --> 54:28.240
But the release comes from the novelty,

54:28.240 --> 54:30.240
from this new kind of compressed thing,

54:30.240 --> 54:31.240
that then brings out the release.

54:31.240 --> 54:34.240
But it's nothing to do with wisdom.

54:34.240 --> 54:37.240
A key few develop wisdom in regard to it.

54:37.240 --> 54:40.240
It will not be on account of going as techniques.

54:40.240 --> 54:42.240
It will be on account of you

54:42.240 --> 54:44.240
practicing understanding,

54:44.240 --> 54:45.240
trying to understand,

54:45.240 --> 54:46.240
trying to find out

54:46.240 --> 54:47.240
what understanding means.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.240
And when you do,

54:48.240 --> 54:50.240
you realize you don't have to do going.

54:50.240 --> 54:52.240
Well, not more than go out,

54:52.240 --> 54:53.240
by yourself,

54:53.240 --> 54:54.240
and start sweeping trees,

54:54.240 --> 54:55.240
or carry bricks,

54:55.240 --> 54:56.240
if you want.

54:56.240 --> 54:58.240
P.T. is like a feeding,

54:58.240 --> 54:59.240
feelings in power,

54:59.240 --> 55:00.240
to keep all the loving,

55:00.240 --> 55:01.240
and to go in,

55:01.240 --> 55:02.240
and let this look in.

55:02.240 --> 55:03.240
Yeah, it's all based on the body.

55:03.240 --> 55:04.240
Based on the body.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.240
Yeah, you observe bodily sensations,

55:06.240 --> 55:07.240
which is ordered,

55:07.240 --> 55:09.240
your contradiction in terms.

55:09.240 --> 55:11.240
You don't feel your body.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.240
You perceive it.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.240
You can experience feelings in your mind,

55:15.240 --> 55:18.240
in regard to what body is going through,

55:18.240 --> 55:20.240
especially if you're

55:20.240 --> 55:22.240
identifying with your body,

55:22.240 --> 55:23.240
your material form,

55:23.240 --> 55:26.240
you're suffering more than.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.240
But again,

55:27.240 --> 55:29.240
any suffering that happens,

55:29.240 --> 55:30.240
or not,

55:30.240 --> 55:31.240
happens on the level of mind,

55:31.240 --> 55:32.240
not on the body.

55:32.240 --> 55:35.240
So then removing a particular knee pain,

55:35.240 --> 55:37.240
it's playing ridiculous,

55:37.240 --> 55:39.240
when it comes to understanding the nature of suffering.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.240
Like, why would this be relevant in any way?

55:41.240 --> 55:44.240
Yeah, just stretch your knee, if it hurts.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.240
That's the end of it.

55:46.240 --> 55:48.240
Well, I'm concentrating on the method

55:48.240 --> 55:49.240
that only one thing is,

55:49.240 --> 55:51.240
this body is changing.

55:51.240 --> 55:53.240
This encounter is really ticker.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.240
Well, yeah,

55:54.240 --> 55:55.240
they say the body is changing

55:55.240 --> 55:56.240
in that sense,

55:56.240 --> 55:57.240
it's constantly changing,

55:57.240 --> 55:59.240
like a constant flow.

55:59.240 --> 56:01.240
But that's not true,

56:01.240 --> 56:03.240
because it's changing on one level,

56:03.240 --> 56:05.240
but on another level,

56:05.240 --> 56:07.240
it's still the same body.

56:07.240 --> 56:09.240
Because if the body is constantly changing,

56:09.240 --> 56:10.240
every second becoming different body,

56:10.240 --> 56:13.240
you wouldn't be able to refer to it as the body.

56:13.240 --> 56:16.240
You wouldn't be able to use the same designation for it.

56:16.240 --> 56:19.240
But the fact that you can say it's still the same body,

56:19.240 --> 56:22.240
means that change that the Buddha talks about

56:22.240 --> 56:26.240
is slightly more complex than just saying it's all impermanent.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.240
And modern science has proven

56:28.240 --> 56:31.240
that atoms and electrons are constantly changing,

56:31.240 --> 56:33.240
so everything is in a constant change.

56:33.240 --> 56:35.240
If everything is constantly changing,

56:35.240 --> 56:37.240
there is no change at all.

56:37.240 --> 56:40.240
Because in order for change to be perceived,

56:40.240 --> 56:43.240
there has to be a part that's not changing.

56:43.240 --> 56:46.240
Otherwise, you can't say it's changing.

56:46.240 --> 56:49.240
There is no reference point.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.240
So saying the body is constantly changing

56:51.240 --> 56:53.240
is a contradiction in terms,

56:53.240 --> 56:55.240
or a wrong view.

56:55.240 --> 56:57.240
Because it's changing on one level

56:57.240 --> 56:59.240
while still remaining the same.

56:59.240 --> 57:02.240
So, all myoko is the same myoko.

57:02.240 --> 57:04.240
There was young myoko.

57:04.240 --> 57:06.240
Obviously, there is a difference.

57:06.240 --> 57:07.240
The body, you know,

57:07.240 --> 57:09.240
grew bigger, got older and so on.

57:09.240 --> 57:11.240
But it's still the same body.

57:11.240 --> 57:14.240
So change, or rather, is in a way called invariant,

57:14.240 --> 57:16.240
under transformation,

57:16.240 --> 57:18.240
or means persisting while changing,

57:18.240 --> 57:19.240
persisting the same,

57:19.240 --> 57:21.240
while it's changing on another level.

57:21.240 --> 57:23.240
No, no, no, no, no.

57:23.240 --> 57:26.240
He was looking at the hand,

57:26.240 --> 57:27.240
holding the pen,

57:27.240 --> 57:29.240
and something,

57:29.240 --> 57:31.240
is it the same or different?

57:31.240 --> 57:33.240
Is it the same or the thing

57:33.240 --> 57:34.240
he was speaking about,

57:34.240 --> 57:36.240
is it changing in form or something?

57:36.240 --> 57:38.240
Well, I don't really remember that context,

57:38.240 --> 57:39.240
but I think...

57:39.240 --> 57:41.240
Is it, like,

57:41.240 --> 57:43.240
he was looking at the pen,

57:43.240 --> 57:45.240
that he was holding the pen in his hand,

57:45.240 --> 57:47.240
and is it that, like,

57:47.240 --> 57:49.240
the same or different?

57:49.240 --> 57:50.240
I remember,

57:50.240 --> 57:51.240
when a barber,

57:51.240 --> 57:53.240
he explained the like,

57:53.240 --> 57:54.240
that the ship,

57:54.240 --> 57:55.240
that there's some part over the ship,

57:55.240 --> 57:57.240
that the gradually replacing,

57:57.240 --> 57:59.240
and is it the same ship for another?

57:59.240 --> 58:00.240
Is it...

58:00.240 --> 58:01.240
I see what you mean.

58:01.240 --> 58:02.240
No, that was slightly different though.

58:02.240 --> 58:03.240
I think there was a different context.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.240
Now, I was talking about the pen,

58:05.240 --> 58:06.240
it was about the intention

58:06.240 --> 58:07.240
to run the letter,

58:07.240 --> 58:09.240
intention to go with the meaning and so on,

58:09.240 --> 58:12.240
but in a way,

58:12.240 --> 58:14.240
that's what I was telling you,

58:14.240 --> 58:15.240
maybe last week,

58:15.240 --> 58:17.240
I don't know what it was,

58:17.240 --> 58:18.240
when I said,

58:18.240 --> 58:20.240
when you designate a thing,

58:20.240 --> 58:23.240
that designation is part of a thing.

58:23.240 --> 58:26.240
So, when you refer to something as a ship,

58:26.240 --> 58:29.240
you designate certain collection

58:29.240 --> 58:32.240
of things as a ship.

58:32.240 --> 58:34.240
So,

58:34.240 --> 58:37.240
sometimes you can change parts so much,

58:37.240 --> 58:40.240
that it becomes a different ship.

58:40.240 --> 58:44.240
But if your designation was on the level of A ship,

58:44.240 --> 58:46.240
means it still stayed the same,

58:46.240 --> 58:48.240
because although it's all different parts,

58:48.240 --> 58:50.240
it's still a ship.

58:50.240 --> 58:53.240
Obviously, if you start putting car parts on your ship,

58:53.240 --> 58:55.240
and then you turn it into a car,

58:55.240 --> 58:57.240
you can't say it's a ship anymore.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.240
It means off,

58:58.240 --> 58:59.240
it's a car now,

58:59.240 --> 59:00.240
so it has changed.

59:00.240 --> 59:03.240
But that change is external.

59:03.240 --> 59:07.240
That change has nothing to do with the impermanence of the terminations,

59:07.240 --> 59:10.240
that the Buddha is talking about.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.240
Sabres and Karna Nietzsche is nothing to do with them,

59:12.240 --> 59:15.240
because this is just something you observe with your senses.

59:15.240 --> 59:17.240
Oh, yeah, the curtains have faded,

59:17.240 --> 59:19.240
the door is broken.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.240
It's irrelevant.

59:21.240 --> 59:24.240
What is not irrelevant is you move in regard to it,

59:24.240 --> 59:26.240
your feelings in regard to that.

59:26.240 --> 59:28.240
So, if that door was a very important door,

59:28.240 --> 59:32.240
given to you by very important person handcrafted,

59:32.240 --> 59:34.240
it would be a very valuable door,

59:34.240 --> 59:35.240
and if it gets broken,

59:35.240 --> 59:38.240
you suffer because the whole significance is affected by it.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.240
It means you were attached to it in a way,

59:41.240 --> 59:44.240
but saying that the door is constantly changing

59:44.240 --> 59:47.240
makes no difference to the fact that it is significant

59:47.240 --> 59:50.240
and it means a lot to me.

59:50.240 --> 59:53.240
So, whether it's changing or not,

59:53.240 --> 59:57.240
the significance of the door or of any object that you are attached to,

59:57.240 --> 59:59.240
it remains unaffected.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.240
So, you can be trying to repeat,

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240
it's all changing, it's all changing.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.240
Still, it means a lot to you.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.240
And by saying it's all changing, it's all changing,

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.240
you're basically trying to deny the fact

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.240
that it means a lot to you.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.240
Instead of taking responsibility,

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.240
that it means a lot to you.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.240
And through accepting responsibility for different amounts of meanings,

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.240
so to speak, different significance,

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.240
like, I don't care much about this sheet,

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.240
but I care about the water filter,

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.240
because it's more important to me.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.240
And that's normal.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.240
It's different levels of intentionality.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.240
But me, trying to deny all of that,

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.240
thinking that's the escape from it,

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.240
but it's not.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:45.240
The escape is first step is to admit that the things that mean differently to you.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.240
Sometimes something means more,

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.240
sometimes it means less.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:55.240
What you want to accept that responsibility for the difference significance

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.240
and then overcome it,

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.240
or rather, becomes stronger

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.240
than the strongest significance you're experiencing in the world.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.240
You're feminine, usually.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.240
That's something like everybody's usually attached.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.240
You can't help but being attached to your family, to your children.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.240
So you don't want to deny it.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.240
You can't deny it,

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.240
but you won't free you from the attachment.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.240
It will just cause denial, saying,

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.240
that's not really my child.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.240
It's constantly changing, everything is constantly changing.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.240
No, it's your child.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.240
And he's changing while remaining your child.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.240
That's how things work.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.240
So you want to be able to fully accept responsibility

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.240
for that being your child,

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.240
for all the feelings you have,

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.240
fully accept responsibility,

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.240
and then become stronger than that responsibility.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.240
So when that child is taken away from you,

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.240
one way or the other,

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.240
your mind will not go with it.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.240
No, through denying that that was your child,

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.240
but through becoming stronger,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.240
than any significance you can gather from the world.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.240
Because stronger, isn't it?

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.240
It means not being moved by it.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.240
So if this door is very important to me,

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.240
it was a gift made, whatever,

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.240
I acknowledge all that,

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.240
and I fully accept that,

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.240
and fully responsibility.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240
And yeah, if somebody asks,

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.240
does this door mean more than that broom?

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240
I would say yes.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.240
It's more important,

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.240
and it was a gift by a good friend or whatever else.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.240
He made it especially for me,

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.240
and my God's welfare.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.240
And that's it's really such.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240
So there's no point,

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.240
there's no reason to deny that.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.240
Unless I believe the denial of that

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.240
would free me from my attachment to it.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.240
But he won't.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.240
In order to free myself from the attachment

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.240
of the important external object,

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.240
he's through overcoming the significance of the external object

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.240
without denying it.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.240
So you have to admit that it's important,

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:55.240
and then become more stronger than that importance.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.240
So when the importance is taken away,

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.240
when the thing that is important is taken away,

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.240
you are not affected.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.240
So as the mundane right view,

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240
say to repeat again,

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240
there is mother,

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240
there is father.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240
It doesn't go around saying,

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.240
oh no, it's just collection of atoms,

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.240
and everything is constantly changing.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.240
There is no mother,

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.240
there is no father, there is nothing.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.240
And that's what Gwankha said.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.240
Which means Gwankha is not even a mundane right view.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.240
And he was just one of them,

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.240
really.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.240
There's so many,

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.240
like saying the same basically.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.240
To become stronger,

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.240
to overcome the needs of understanding.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.240
And understanding what,

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.240
and understanding for myself?

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240
Understanding that actually,

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.240
no matter how important to you is,

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.240
it was inaccessible to you from the beginning.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.240
You could have not owned it from the start.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.240
The only reason you owned it,

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240
the only reason you were attached to it

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.240
is because you didn't know that it's impossible to own it.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.240
When you know it's impossible to own,

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240
it's like a relief.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.240
And then, yeah,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240
it's an important though.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.240
But it doesn't mean that I'll suffer if I lose it.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.240
No, it doesn't mean that I will be all carried away

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.240
if I get another one.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.240
Suppose that's meant to child in that case,

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240
that you understand,

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.240
not mine,

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.240
it means actually how to understand it,

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.240
it was separate.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.240
Well, again, first you have to accept it as yours,

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.240
accept full responsibility for it,

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.240
for all the feelings you had.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.240
And then, but becoming stronger than that,

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.240
you can experience,

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.240
well, a form of disson.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.240
So, you're not denying the significance of a child,

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.240
or significance of a parent,

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.240
or a mother or father,

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.240
but means you develop yourself further than that significance.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.240
So, when the significant object disappears,

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.240
eventually,

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.240
means you won't be taken by it.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.240
And the reason, again,

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.240
why Anitcha from the Sutras is different

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.240
than Anitcha has been taught,

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.240
as taught in the Sutras,

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.240
by going out of it,

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.240
because you don't actually have to wait for things to cease.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.240
You don't have to see the ending in order to see Anitcha.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.240
You know them that they are impermanent,

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.240
while they are impermanent.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.240
Because they are impermanent.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.240
That's it.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.240
Why they are impermanent?

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.240
Because they have a reason on their own.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.240
It's difficult point,

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.240
and it's a different point.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.240
Because usually, see this tree got destroyed.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.240
Everything is impermanent.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.240
No, actually,

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.240
when you're experiencing right there,

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.240
there is the positive experience

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.240
of a destruction of a tree.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.240
And that's a present experience,

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.240
which means, actually,

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.240
nothing can cease,

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.240
there is another experience right there.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.240
But if you are concerned about the things in the world,

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.240
as fundamental,

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.240
then yes, the destruction of the tree will mean impermanence.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240
But it doesn't.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.240
The impermanence from the Sutras refers to the impermanence,

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.240
impermanent nature of your experience,

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.240
of your five aggregates.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.240
But unless,

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.240
the moment when you die,

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.240
you won't experience the ending,

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.240
which means, a nature from the Sutras

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.240
is different than a nature that you can observe in your senses.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.240
And it is different,

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.240
because if you weren't,

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.240
you wouldn't need a bullet to teach on each and another.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.240
You could just see it yourself,

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.240
with your eyes,

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.240
or here with your ears.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.240
Oh, yes, it's impermanent.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.240
I saw it.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.240
Because when you see a destruction of a house,

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.240
again,

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.240
experience of seeing a destruction of a house

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.240
has a reason,

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.240
which means there's no impermanence there.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.240
It's on the relative impermanence

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.240
of a certain house changing its shape,

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.240
from being a useful or in-shape useful for inhabiting.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:52.240
Now it's a less useful shape of a pile of rubble.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.240
It's still something you're perceiving,

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.240
so you just perceive a different perception

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:03.240
that you externally explain to yourself as change.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.240
Just see what I mean.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.240
No, no.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.240
You can ask a question there.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:13.240
You said this is what has arisen with it.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.240
It is impermanent.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.240
I actually don't understand.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.240
Again, let's take the example of a house.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.240
You look at the house.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.240
You have the experience of seeing a house.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.240
Experience as a whole.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.240
We're not just talking about a house,

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.240
because it's never just a house.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.240
You are always in every situation.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.240
Even when you think about the situation,

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.240
that you are not present in,

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.240
you are present in your thoughts.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.240
Mentally, that's your situation.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.240
So you cannot leave yourself out.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.240
Which means there is no objective scientific world

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.240
everybody talks about.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.240
The only world you know is the one you can perceive.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.240
So when you look at a house,

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:54.240
that's the experience of seeing a house.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.240
Now, somebody starts destroying a house.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.240
That's the experience of seeing a house being destroyed.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.240
It's another experience.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.240
Impermanence that the Buddha talks about

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.240
pertains to the experience of any kind.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.240
Not of the specific house,

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.240
a tree or a child.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.240
Experience in itself is impermanent.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.240
Because it has a reason on its own.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.240
So basically when you are experiencing the perception of the house,

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.240
your experience is known as impermanent.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240
As a result of that,

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.240
any ownership that you have to your house,

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.240
will disappear even in that house and remain standing.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.240
So destroying the house,

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.240
setting it on fire,

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.240
makes no difference to the internal impermanence.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.240
Nothing to do because it's another experience.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.240
Are there?

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.240
Sometimes having a house being destroyed

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.240
can possibly remind you of

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.240
if you already know it first,

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.240
not if you don't know it.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.240
That actually it was impermanent to begin with.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.240
It was impermanent while it was still standing.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.240
And look, now it's being destroyed.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.240
Of course, it was always impermanent.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.240
Subject to destruction means it can be destroyed.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.240
It will be destroyed.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.240
It doesn't mean necessarily it's being destroyed while I'm staring at it.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.240
Do you see the difference here?

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.240
Yeah, actually,

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.240
this is where the house is implemented or not.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.240
If I don't have experience with that,

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.240
there's no any problem with people.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.240
So the only reason people use

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.240
that they say western science

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.240
so they say everything is impermanent.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.240
Just observe sensations.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.240
Everything is constantly changing.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.240
It's basically to deny

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.240
the responsibility for it,

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.240
believing that's the escape.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.240
But it's not.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.240
It's a completely wrong direction.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.240
If you want a escape,

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.240
you first want to admit that the thing

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.240
means something to you or not.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.240
And then without abandoning that responsibility,

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.240
or not.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.240
And you don't have to witness

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.240
or have it destroyed in order to prove to yourself

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.240
that it was impermanent.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.240
Meaning, if you needed to prove to yourself externally,

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.240
it means you were never sure about it internal,

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.240
which means there is no knowledge.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.240
Hmm.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.240
Why would the thought fall to all the body?

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.240
It didn't.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.240
It didn't.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.240
No.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.240
Never like that.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.240
He would say you observe parts of the body,

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.240
like lungs or whatever,

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.240
like all of the context of my body,

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.240
my strong healthy body.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.240
So to experience this past,

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.240
this passion in regard to that body.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.240
If you just think of a parallel lung,

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.240
it's quite disgusting.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.240
And then parallel lung,

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.240
that's exactly what I have in me.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.240
If you think about intestines,

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.240
and it's skin, hair,

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.240
think about that,

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.240
it will make you experience this passion.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240
Because it's not beautiful.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.240
He didn't teach sweet associations

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.240
and being aware of your kneecap,

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.240
or whatever else.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.240
No, it was a contemplation of bringing those things to mind

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.240
so to experience this passion.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.240
You're doing long enough,

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.240
then even when you don't have those things in your mind,

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.240
just being aware of your body will be seen

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.240
as those healthy things.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.240
Hmm.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:16.240
It's very interesting.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.240
I think many people write an entire diver,

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.240
and many people write a body contemplation,

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.240
and write that body.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.240
Yeah, that's what I have done.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.240
It's for that reason.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240
Because usually people don't think about death,

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240
don't want to think about death, don't see death.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.240
So seeing a dead body

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.240
or things of their nature

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.240
will all remind you.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.240
I cannot escape this.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.240
This will happen to me.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.240
So you experience this passion towards your life,

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.240
towards life of others,

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.240
towards you realize, oh,

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.240
it will all end like this.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.240
It's a reminder of something

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.240
that kind of everybody knows

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.240
in the back of their mind.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.240
Obviously, it's not, again,

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.240
there is no wisdom.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.240
People can go bit funny in regard to it,

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.240
because it can be too much of a shock or something,

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.240
and then they can go mad

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.240
as they did in the suitors,

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.240
and they really practiced

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240
hard contemplation of death.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240
The Buddha went out for the retreat.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.240
Obviously, they came back as like

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.240
maybe half of the monks left.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.240
So what happened to the rest of the world?

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.240
They were jumping off the cliffs and stuff,

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.240
because they were,

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.240
and he said, okay, well, in that case,

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.240
practice mindfulness of breathing.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.240
They have one result

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.240
in such extreme actions.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.240
Obviously, if somebody does

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.240
Maranusati correctly,

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.240
they can become Maran very quickly.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.240
Because it's a fairer,

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.240
direct, forceful, dispassion.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.240
Mad.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.240
Yeah, I did it.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.240
It's very interesting.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.240
Attachment of the child also,

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.240
it means that it's experience.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.240
Yeah, it's real.

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.240
It's real as such.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.240
People think they can deal with attachment

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.240
by denying it, by saying, well,

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.240
it's not really, it's just atoms,

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.240
it's molecule.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.240
So I don't need to see, like,

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.240
the child's body is changing.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.240
No, it's irrelevant.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.240
You have to accept the responsibility

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.240
for your feelings. You must not deny it.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.240
You have to accept

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.240
the weight, the significance

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.240
of having your child.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.240
And that's how you can overcome.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.240
And that experience is important.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.240
Yeah.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.240
That's what impermanence pretends to.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.240
Experience is important.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.240
It means it's changing.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.240
No, it means it will come to rent.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.240
Even if you don't see it in the server.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240
That's very important.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.240
You have to accept it in the server.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.240
As the server said,

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.240
whatever has the nature of rising

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.240
has the nature of ceasing.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.240
Even if you're not witnessing the ceasing,

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.240
just in its nature,

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.240
it will be affected by ceasing.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.240
It will cease.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.240
It will come to rent.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.240
Why? Because it has a reason.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.240
Because its nature has manifested.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.240
For that reason,

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.240
it will have to go.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.240
Nothing else.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.240
No, because molecules are changing.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.240
No, because somebody can come and destroy it.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.240
Just because it has appeared.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.240
Is there any...

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.240
Is there any nibbana in common?

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.240
Is it true?

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.240
No.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.240
No.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.240
Because permanent nibbana doesn't apply

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.240
to nibbana.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.240
Because nibbana cannot even be dead.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.240
Any designations?

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.240
Applied to things.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.240
Any bana means surpassing all that.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.240
It doesn't make sense.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.240
And there is that, I think...

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.240
It's true.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.240
True available.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.240
When Bikuni,

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.240
Damodino was answering the questions

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.240
of her ex-husband.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.240
And he was asking,

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.240
where does this lead?

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.240
And they came to a point that

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.240
well, that leads to nibbana.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.240
Well, where does nibbana lead?

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.240
What's nibbana is?

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.240
Well, the point of your questioning

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.240
cannot be applied to nibbana.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.240
That's any answer I give you won't make any sense.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.240
Or it could be completely misspecived.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.240
And is there any kind of decision?

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.240
The least of 32 designations

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.240
for nibbana, like, describing another shore?

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.240
All right.

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.240
Definitely.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.240
Niche.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.240
Permanent.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.240
Well, I guess I have read that sort of.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.240
But if you mean in terms of nibbana,

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.240
the other shore,

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.240
is the definition of

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.240
greater version of illusion,

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.240
free from bondage,

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.240
whatever else.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.240
And if you say in that sense,

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.240
as here you could just talk about this,

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.240
I can see that if you say in that sense,

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.240
or it's permanent,

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.240
from the point of view of the impermanent that you're living in,

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.240
then yeah.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.240
But you can't say it's permanent in last forever.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.240
Because if something,

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.240
usually if people say permanent,

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.240
they mean eternal.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.240
Permanent in eternal.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.240
Eternal means basically

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.240
when things are taken as self,

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.240
it will last forever.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.240
And that's usually the sense of permanence.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.240
Like a soul or something.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.240
So if somebody said nibbana is permanent,

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.240
by quoting this sutra,

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.240
that's okay. But then it should be clarified

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.240
that it's in the context

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.240
from the point of view of the impermanent.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.240
But if they say nibbana is permanent,

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.240
means once you enter it,

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.240
it lasts forever. That makes no sense.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.240
Because the idea of lasting and time

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.240
cannot pertain to timeless nibbana.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.240
So permanent as pertaining,

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.240
referring to time,

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.240
usually cannot pertain to the timeless nibbana.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.240
It doesn't make sense.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.240
Unless you use it as evidence

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.240
to describe it,

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.240
in which case you should probably clarify it as such.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.240
It's not right to say it.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.240
Sansa or it's permanent

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.240
only based on determination that it's self.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.240
Again, it's not permanent.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.240
It's just that

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240
it's going to be occurring

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.240
for as long as you don't see

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.240
the nature of it and escape it.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.240
But then, again,

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.240
saying permanent or impermanent

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.240
cannot really designate that correctly.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.240
Unless you're using to inspire somebody

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.240
to say them, yeah, from your point of view

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.240
of this soul impermanence,

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.240
this is the permanent, this is the stable,

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.240
from suffering, sure.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.240
But in terms of, if you use permanent

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.240
as a designation of time

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.240
last forever,

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.240
it doesn't work like that.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.240
What has arisen

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.240
it is impermanent.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.240
It is just a raw nature.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.240
It just must understand it.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.240
What has arisen

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.240
that they experience?

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.240
It is impermanent.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.240
But sometimes, because

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.240
the user, we don't see the beginning

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.240
at the end, it's quite

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.240
different to receive it.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.240
You know, to see that correctly,

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.240
what is arisen is impermanent,

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.240
because the arisen first

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.240
you have to accept it,

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.240
and what is arisen is real.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.240
Even if it's a fantasy in your thoughts,

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.240
it's really a search,

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.240
and then you have to accept

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240
responsibility for it.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.240
And then, through that,

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.240
it's interesting by itself.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.240
But if, kind of,

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.240
catch up, and try to do it

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.240
before,

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.240
basically means you'll be,

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.240
it will become a part of the narrative.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.240
I think that the only,

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.240
only way to show the

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.240
impermanence is clear.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.240
It supports, like, two Christian people

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:42.240
who never accept Dharma,

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.240
they have a Buddhism.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.240
For them, what we can do,

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.240
is to prove the experience,

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.240
just to think,

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.240
impermanence is quite different

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.240
to the experience,

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.240
but attention changes.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.240
That's the only way

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.240
to explain impermanence.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.240
Well, I don't think they'll get it like that.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.240
First, they have to be willing

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.240
to follow,

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.240
not just Christians,

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.240
or wherever you're talking,

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.240
even Buddhists actually.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240
Because if they think they already know it,

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.240
whatever you say,

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.240
will fall on their fears.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.240
So, saying everything is changing

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.240
will be okay, so what?

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.240
I think it's closer,

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.240
probably, to say, well,

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.240
the fact that you will die,

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.240
the fact that you don't really know what's after your life,

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.240
you can't be sure.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.240
Do you really want to spend your life

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.240
based on the mere belief,

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.240
and mere faith,

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.240
in an imaginary friend,

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.240
or something like that?

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.240
You cannot verify.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.240
The God exists as such,

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.240
the heaven exists as such,

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.240
the Jesus exists as such.

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.240
You'll be saved for sure.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.240
How can you be sure?

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.240
Even if you do everything rightly

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.240
for the rest of your life,

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.240
as the Jesus prescribed,

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.240
or whoever, in the Bible,

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.240
you still cannot be 100% sure

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.240
that then will be the outcome.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.240
So, your entire life,

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.240
all of your actions,

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.240
are rooted in faith,

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.240
in just blind faith,

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.240
and that's why it's unwholesome.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.240
If someone is suffering,

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.240
suffering from sickness,

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.240
like a terminal,

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:27.240
then if they ask us,

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.240
how to be free from suffering,

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.240
in the case of Putu,

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:31.240
generally,

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.240
it might be a bit late for them at that point.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.240
If we just tell them

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.240
that the things have arisen,

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.240
it is important.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.240
If they've been practicing throughout their life,

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.240
then, yeah, you could remind them

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.240
of the dharma in the Sultansan,

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.240
but if they haven't,

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.240
you can't say anything.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.240
It's very difficult point

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.240
that you've been in the Lanyana,

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.240
but it is for the name, sickness.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.240
So, the pain that depends on someone

01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.240
is really serious and sick.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.240
Because pain is everything.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.240
Well, the most you can say

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.240
to a person who never practice

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.240
and the most of the death is

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.240
life.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.240
Provided they were good things that they've done.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.240
If they haven't well,

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.240
then try to think

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.240
good things now,

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.240
but they might be a bit late,

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.240
but obviously.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.240
When I'm sick,

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.240
doesn't mean I observe.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.240
I can see as relief with attention,

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.240
definitely changes.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.240
All the time, we never think about the pain.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.240
Pain is present all the time,

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.240
but we are thinking about many other things.

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.240
We are thinking about the object

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.240
and the only thing that's going to

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.240
understand the impermanence.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.240
No, no, no.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.240
As I said,

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.240
you don't have to keep witnessing the change

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.240
to understand impermanence.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.240
You have to recognize

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.240
independent arising of things,

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.240
arising on their own

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.240
in order to recognize impermanence.

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.240
They're not impermanence

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.240
because they're not impermanent

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.240
because they're going to come to an end.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.240
In the first place.

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.240
So they will have to come to an end.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.240
Not to come to an end.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.240
So you start worrying about cessation of things,

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.240
start looking in their arising.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.240
If they have a reason,

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.240
you have no say in it.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.240
You have no say in arising of your thoughts.

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.240
You have some say in what you're going to attend,

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.240
once it has a reason.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.240
But the fact that

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.240
it will always arise on its own.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.240
I heard that Feng Anaman Yanemi

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.240
was doing walking meditation

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.240
and he already proven his

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.240
what he was doing.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.240
How to understand.

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.240
I mean,

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.240
I simply heard that

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.240
what he was doing is the need to receive.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:45.240
But how?

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.240
How is it quite hard

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.240
to understand that?

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.240
It is because if you would,

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.240
you would be a subtle body.

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.240
But what he kept observing?

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.240
The very good experience.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.240
Well, he was pondering and reflecting on Dhamma.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.240
He was pondering on the nature of our arising.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.240
So you lined up three people

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.240
and you did an experiment of them.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:11.240
And you forget that you are the one observing the experiment.

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.240
So if you are focused on your experiment,

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:17.240
you will be able to see yourself experimenting.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.240
But if you see yourself experimenting,

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:21.240
you can stop doing experiments.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.240
You can just see yourself doing whatever.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.240
So the lay you maintain mind for instance,

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.240
already you see the background that moved

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.240
the way how you are feeling

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.240
the mental state that in the

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.240
relation to the situation,

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:37.240
you can see how that affects you

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.240
on a particular level.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.240
What it makes you think, what it makes you choose,

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.240
what it makes you dwell on.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.240
And if it makes you dwell on the bad things

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.240
because you're in bad mood,

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.240
well, you can choose to dwell on not bad things.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.240
Or you can choose to not dwell on bad things.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.240
Or you dwell on good things

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.240
while you're in a bad mood.

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.240
You keep dwelling on good things

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.240
or more inspiring things.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.240
And yeah, you can change that mood.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:03.240
Because the mood is not completely independent

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.240
from a particular situation either.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.240
From a particular

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.240
thoughts or perceptions.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.240
But always it's on a different level.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.240
They are simultaneously there,

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.240
but on a different level.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.240
So I think exactly,

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.240
we don't need to know that the

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:23.240
fear of this body is in it. It's not that important.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.240
I did the mood.

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.240
So in that case,

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.240
this body is now in the court.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.240
It's not that important.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.240
You don't have to think about the location.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.240
But you have to think about you in the situation.

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.240
Which is your body in the situation.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.240
So whether it's you and you could there,

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.240
you're in a talk talk,

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.240
or you're walking on a path,

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.240
you in a certain location,

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.240
which is what makes the whole situation.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.240
Thinking about the kutti in the shape of the walls,

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.240
just have to know that you are in that situation.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.240
And the bodily posture

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.240
is like the first kind of

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:01.240
first designation of your situation.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.240
You're seated in such and such place.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.240
You're standing in such and such.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.240
It's like the most fundamental

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.240
external output you're in.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.240
Because while you're seated,

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.240
you can't have intentions of,

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.240
you know, based on your standing,

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.240
or based on your walking,

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.240
or based on your lying down.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.240
That's why being aware of your bodily posture

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.240
kind of makes you aware of the whole situation already.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.240
But being aware of your bodily posture

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.240
has a background.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.240
Not as a kind of going, observing sensation.

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.240
It's actually very different that there is a mood

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.240
in the mental state.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.240
Seeing it as general background is quite hard.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.240
Something with appears in front.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.240
Well, if it appears in front,

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.240
then there is something appearing in front.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.240
But there is always a background to it.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.240
So that doesn't mean that you lost the sight of your background.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.240
Unless you got confused.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.240
Supposedly that mood is in there.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.240
Any mood is in there.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.240
Happy or whatever.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.240
It is not in front.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.240
I have seated background.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.240
Yeah.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.240
But you can say, oh, I am happy.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.240
And that doesn't mean that your background

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.240
will not change suddenly.

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:11.240
You can still be happy.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.240
You shouldn't confuse that you saying I am happy

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.240
is your happiness.

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.240
Happiness is the state of mind,

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.240
which is always in the background.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.240
The purpose of the practices

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.240
to understand the intention.

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.240
That the important.

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.240
Yeah, to overcome it.

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.240
To understand it, to overcome.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:33.240
But recognizing that the things arise on their own,

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.240
by not being moved by your mood,

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.240
wholesome or unwholesome,

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:41.240
you end up like, well, you stop appropriating it.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.240
You see, ah, this thing doesn't require sense of self.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.240
Sense of self becomes part of that mood.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.240
Me just becomes part of that whole picture

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.240
of background and of general in particular.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.240
And by not knowing general in particular,

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.240
you were centered on yourself.

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.240
But now you recognize this operates without a self.

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.240
So the center from yourself is removed.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.240
And when the center is not in the self,

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.240
that's not self.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.240
Mm-hmm.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.240
Mm-hmm.

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:13.240
Actually, the center for you,

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.240
for the area, I believe in self in that.

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.240
Actually, if I sink,

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.240
or you actually serve before me in common.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.240
It's up to me, because the fans fear this body thing.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.240
Actually, according to the situation,

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.240
fear this body thing.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.240
Actually, the mood changes.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.240
I mean, it's quite strange,

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.240
but that is really self.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.240
It wouldn't change.

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:37.240
But you are, it's something that needs to be,

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.240
you have to dwell on it, on and on.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.240
Because the self is also,

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.240
you see it once,

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.240
you have to keep dwelling on it.

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.240
That it cannot be on,

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.240
that it's subject to cessation,

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.240
because it's already there.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.240
Because you have no sense.

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.240
And if you dwell on it long enough,

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.240
then you stop feeling its mind.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.240
Mm-hmm.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.240
It means there's no meaning

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.240
that to keep seeing it, it's arising in tension.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.240
If it has already,

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.240
it is given in tension,

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.240
so it is not mind.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.240
If I keep observing,

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.240
there's no point of reading it.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.240
Well, there is no point,

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.240
because if you do it like that,

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.240
you end up not taking responsibility for it.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.240
First, you have to learn

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.240
how to always be responsible for that.

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.240
And then you can start saying,

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.240
yeah, this is not mind,

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.240
through that responsibility,

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.240
the order of things is important.

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.240
All the externally might be the same.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.240
Yes, this doesn't belong to me.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.240
It depends whether you said it before,

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.240
you took full responsibility or after.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.240
If you said before,

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.240
means you obscure the responsibility,

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.240
you obscure the feeling,

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.240
you obscure the camera.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.240
But if you do it after,

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.240
then how? Okay.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.240
Without abandoning, which means you don't do it

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.240
for the reasons

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:57.240
of avoiding responsibility,

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.240
which is why people do it.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.240
No, you accept responsibility,

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.240
you don't fear responsibility,

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.240
no matter how fearful it is,

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.240
and then you do it.

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.240
And then it can apply to responsibility.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.240
But if you want to avoid responsibility and do it,

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.240
there's nothing,

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.240
because it can only apply to responsibility,

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.240
but because you avoid it,

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.240
there's nothing to apply to it.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.240
So you end up just keep doing,

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.240
keep saying, keep denying,

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.240
but it doesn't really lead anywhere.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:27.240
You just try to suppose,

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:55.240
but it doesn't really lead anywhere.
