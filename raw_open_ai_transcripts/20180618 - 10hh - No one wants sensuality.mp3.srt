1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,480
So you were saying earlier in terms of sensuality, in terms of anger, which you said some

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,080
particularly when you just quote you guys, the only reason why one gives into sensuality

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:34,080
is because one doesn't want to spend anything. What I meant was that so universally, literally

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:41,280
to every human mind regardless of the culture, education, religion, practice, whether they

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,560
heard about Buddhism or not, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. When a desire arises in

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:54,000
regard to anything, obtainable to the senses, when that desire arises, that desire is oppressing

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,720
that person. Desire is that sort of lack, pressure, a need, thirst, hunger, whatever. Means it makes

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,760
you act, it pressures you, I mean you don't have to act, that's the whole point. As a human being

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,720
you have a choice, but when desire arises the automatic responses to give into that pressure of

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,200
the desire. And why would you be giving into the pressure of any desire? It's because it's

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,920
unpleasant. If the pressure of the desire is neutral or pleasant, you wouldn't then spend all the

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,600
efforts and time gaining what your desire wants because you already be a reason. But that desire,

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,680
it's already unpleasant. So in order for you to deal with that displeasure, you just give in to

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,960
whatever the desire promises. So that's what I mean by engaging in sensuality you do so to be free

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,880
from the central pressure of the desire. So when people say no, I enjoy my senses, that's

16
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,800
that's a mistake that they themselves believe it. If they were to stop and think about and see

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,640
when there is a non-satisfied or unsatisfied desire, is that pleasant? Is that what you want? It

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,600
isn't. You enjoy sensuality for as long as you think and hold a view that you can access things

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,840
that your senses want to, but sooner or later time will come when you won't be able to fulfill

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,680
your desires. And then again, you don't just think, oh these particular desires I can't fulfill.

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
I mean some people might think that, but the point is to see then the nature of the desire in

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,240
the first place. Even the ones you can fulfill, so to speak, as in give in to their pressure and

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,480
seek the object of their desire until you feel fed up with it and then you feel like my desire disappears.

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
So in other words, you can never fulfill the desire. The point of desire is to stay a desire.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,760
Based on non-satisfaction. Exactly. It requires a non-satisfaction for it to be. So that's

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,320
why if you stop and think about it, you realize the only reason you are engaged with sensuality.

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,360
People would be engaged with sensuality is because the pressure of the desire is unpleasant

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,960
and they don't know any other escape. And that's the whole point. And that's the same. Like then

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,960
whenever you encounter any other form of displeasure, your only way of dealing it is sensuality,

30
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,920
which is how people turn to food, music, sexual intercourse or whatever else. When they're sort of

31
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,160
feeling down or depressed or something's bothering them, they just commit harder. Because that's

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,200
the only form that they can resemble a relief of relieving oneself of that pressure. But actually,

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,720
you're just making it worse because the more you're dependent on running away from the desire,

34
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,600
the more pressure that desire will exercise over you.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,760
So what should you do? Well, first, I mean, you don't have to do anything in a way,

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,000
but then you just remain. If you start seeing that, if you start seeing your own sensual,

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,360
your own desires and something that's controlling you, that you are enslaved by,

38
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,160
then you have to start seeing in the nature of before you give into the desire,

39
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:59,040
how it feels to just have the desire. And then it becomes like obviously clear as a day that

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,240
it's very unpleasant. Like even sometimes when you can't satisfy your desires, but maybe not

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:12,800
quickly enough, that's unpleasant. Either way, that discrepancy of desire is rooted in a

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,840
disagreeable feeling, that pressure is very unpleasant. So if you want a free yourself from it,

43
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,720
you have to first start restraining and making it worse through giving in to that pressure of desire.

44
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,080
It's like, oh, you're training yourself to be stronger than something else,

45
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,240
but in order to start doing that, you need to start resisting that thing you're trying to be

46
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,120
strong in regard to. So if you just habitually are giving into the desire and at the same time expect

47
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,520
to be somehow be magically free from the pressure of the desire, but that's just a contradiction in terms.

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
So the restraint needs to come first. For the one who wants to be free from desire,

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,560
restraint needs to come first. Then the obvious, painful nature of the desire in itself becomes a parent.

50
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,360
And I said that before, maybe another audio talk, and that's that's like initially when people

51
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,760
start restraining that pain that arises from the desire. They would think it's because of my

52
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,080
restraint, but it isn't. Restraint cannot cause you pain. It can only reveal the underlying pain

53
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,000
of the desire and not getting what the desire wants. And the similarly of the five animals,

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,520
like pulling you in every, that the Buddha gave in like eye, nose, ear, mouth, and the body.

55
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,480
And as such, they're pulling you in their own domains to feed in their own respective

56
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,480
feeding grounds. Every animal wants to go and eat as much as it likes. So eyes just want to go

57
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,560
and look at the pleasurable sights and avoid this pleasure and it's single for every sense.

58
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,520
So you can imagine that your experience as a whole, your existence is basically you're

59
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,760
tied to these five animals you're inseparable from and they're always overpowering you and you're

60
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,560
you're enabling them enabling them even further when you're carelessly just giving into whatever

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,640
desire your eye wants to have or your ears or your sense of touch. So you can imagine if you

62
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,520
tie to five powerful animals and they start running towards their respective goals, objects of their

63
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:14,320
desire, you just run with it to avoid that terribly painful pull. You will experience if you start

64
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,480
if you try standing your ground but the animals are stronger than you, they will yank you and

65
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,680
it will be very unpleasant. But that doesn't mean that pain is not there if you run with them

66
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,080
because that enables them to pull you even harder. So initially you have to accept that sharp

67
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,840
pain of restraint which eventually you can see that it's actually it's not the restraint. Restrain

68
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,440
just shows me what happens when these animals yank in their respective domains and I don't give in

69
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,040
because if the animals wouldn't be yanking they wouldn't be any pain revealed by the restraint.

70
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,720
Imagine the animals are tamed and calm and they just walk slowly and you can just remain seated

71
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,480
and not have to run with them so they don't rip your arm off. But initially people get confused

72
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,440
and then this might start doing the restraint but then all the pain that arises as a result of

73
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,720
being yanked by these five senses they think it's because they're saying no they think it's because

74
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,680
of the restraint and then eventually they give back in. But it's not that pain is the nature of

75
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,000
being pressured by the senses by the sense desire. It's just when you run along with it you kind of

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,160
minimize the pulse so you pretend it's not there but the fact is all you have to do is say you

77
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,000
know to the desire and you'll see whether it's still there or not that pain. Unless you come really

78
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,800
free of course. So that's something everybody could benefit from just learning how to say no to

79
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,240
themselves gradually more in regard to this in regard to unnecessary things in regard to unnecessary

80
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,840
luxuries in regard to unnecessary indulgences because you are each time you give in carelessly

81
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,080
like that the animals get more to feed on which means they get more powerful which means each time

82
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,280
they pull you you'll be less and less able to resist those desires and very often and I'm

83
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,840
pretty sure many people can can relate to that out of their experience. Your own desire

84
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,960
takes you to the places you don't want to be. You know you like you'll know you regret it even

85
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,920
before him yet you can't help it and you're just drying there and let alone when the old age

86
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,840
sets in or sickness when your senses start to fail yet your mind is fully dependent on that

87
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,080
pleasure that you get from that remote satisfaction of your desires then the only source I said

88
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,240
before the only kind of remotely resemblance way of relief from any disagreeable feelings is

89
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,720
taken away now because senses can't enjoy anymore then you know eyes can't can barely see it's painful

90
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,440
to listen it's it's hard to chew body doesn't listen it's not young doesn't have that much energy

91
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,360
yet your mind was dependent on that constant run and now that's just taken away so when the

92
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,440
unpleasant feelings arise and they will inevitably now you have even less ground to deal with it

93
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,440
it's like a solid to find it. That's why people are terrified of solid
