00:00.000 --> 00:25.200
Well, all the problems can be solved if you see that all problems are caused by craving

00:25.200 --> 00:32.600
people with sheer responsibility. There's no problem if there's no suffering. Or

00:32.600 --> 00:36.400
rather, when there is a problem, means it's something is a problem because it's

00:36.400 --> 00:44.840
making you suffer. Well, headache in itself, it's not a problem nor is it a

00:44.840 --> 00:49.440
suffering. You're not wanting it to be that way and I wanted to have a headache

00:49.440 --> 00:53.120
while having or not having a headache is not in your control. That's why you

00:53.120 --> 00:56.920
suffer. So you crave to get rid of the circumstances that you find this

00:56.920 --> 01:03.040
pleasing, which means you create a problem. That's what I mean. At the root of

01:03.040 --> 01:08.680
every suffering is craving. It's impossible to experience suffering without

01:08.680 --> 01:12.760
having the present craving present in your experience as your attitude. It's

01:12.760 --> 01:16.520
impossible. That's what it would have said that the root of suffering is craving.

01:16.520 --> 01:28.680
Not the external circumstances, however bad they might be.

01:28.680 --> 01:33.760
Poverty is not suffering. Poverty is hardship, but hardship does not need to be

01:33.760 --> 01:41.300
suffering. If you don't, basically, again, in a fundamental level, if you want to

01:41.300 --> 01:49.480
describe the nature of craving, there's these three types. When circumstances are

01:49.480 --> 01:56.360
pleasing, you're craving for more of that pleasure. The circumstances at this

01:56.360 --> 02:03.440
pleasing, you are craving for that this pleasure to disappear, to not be there.

02:03.440 --> 02:08.120
You want to get rid of it instantly. And the third type is the subtlest to see, but

02:08.120 --> 02:12.680
basically, the circumstances are neither good nor bad. You kind of crave towards

02:12.680 --> 02:22.280
indolence and searching excitement or whatever. People fear boredom. They fear

02:22.280 --> 02:27.560
the neutral environment, which is neither good nor bad. They can't recognize it as

02:27.560 --> 02:36.480
peaceful. So in that very manner, a person is fully responsible for all of the

02:36.480 --> 02:41.600
suffering they've experienced in this life. Because there were even cases in

02:41.600 --> 02:46.400
the suitors that the Buddha was giving the example of, was even if a highway

02:46.400 --> 02:53.560
robbers attack you and sever you, limb my limb and torture you. That basically

02:53.560 --> 02:57.480
won't be the suffering for you. It will be your craving in regard to it, your

02:57.480 --> 03:01.200
hatred towards them, trying to get rid of it, thinking why they're doing this,

03:01.200 --> 03:05.280
they shouldn't be doing this. Basically, trying to control the circumstances that

03:05.280 --> 03:13.480
are disagreeable, without recognizing that actually, fundamentally, they're not in

03:13.480 --> 03:18.280
your control. And you're responsible for lack of that knowledge, which then

03:18.280 --> 03:23.280
generates more craving. So you just keep revolving around it.

03:23.280 --> 03:28.280
So it's also instead of trying to solve every little issue that you have?

03:28.280 --> 03:31.680
Exactly, yeah. That's when people don't see the, well, they don't see the

03:31.680 --> 03:35.080
root of suffering. So they think the suffering is the, the circumstances around

03:35.080 --> 03:39.280
them. So then they try to address every single instance, every example, every

03:39.280 --> 03:43.680
issue, every person to talk to, everything disagreeable put away. I mean, that's

03:43.680 --> 03:46.680
usually what people live revolver on.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.680
That ends.

03:48.680 --> 03:54.680
Yeah, it ends because it's misapplied. It's not applied with the problem is.

03:54.680 --> 04:03.080
Which is, which is craving, yeah. So you're basically trying to solve your

04:03.080 --> 04:31.080
suffering by at a completely wrong place where the suffering isn't.
