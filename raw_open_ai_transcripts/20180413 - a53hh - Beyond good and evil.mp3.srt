1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Establishing yourself in the whole state, in that way, staying there, and learning to be composed in there, in the whole state, whatever that whole state must be.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How, let me ask you that, let me ask you that. How are you composed there?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now, it's how that composure will come to be there. Well, as you were saying, it's been able to see the determination of that person.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The relationship between the two. It requires a discernment of the principle of that relationship. That's what the relationship is.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To even be able to dwell in domain. To be able to properly establish in a state of non-Engla.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Like in this particular example. And that's what people fail to see.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Because, yes, everybody can value silence over talking. We can feel more peacefulness there.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Everybody can see as fast and it requires more determination, more resolve, makes your mind stronger. But none of them sees it in a relationship like silence in a relationship to speaking.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because if you were to see it, and even when you're not silent, you would be partaking in silence. You wouldn't be affected by speech.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, if you were to see the proper order, proper relationship between fast phenomenon and fasting in your experience and phenomenon of eating in your experience.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Then, if you might be properly established upon the discernment of that relationship. Not upon the act of fasting. The act of fasting doesn't establish you.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Doesn't establish your mind. That's why the Buddha said that self-mortification won't result in liberation.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So, you need to do it to an extent until you discern the perception of the phenomenon of it.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But, doing it in itself doesn't necessarily, well, for sure, doesn't free you, doesn't do anything for you.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's discernment of the principle in relation to eating from the point of view of fasting. That's where that knowledge is what establishes your mind.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then, basically, whenever you're eating, you won't be affected by the eating. You would remain properly established. You won't be pulled by the food. So, you overcome sensuality.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
In that example, in the example of state of non-engar, which is really great, even for angry people, it's more common, you're not angry.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's just when you have the births of anger, that's what you focus on.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, you can't spend all your time being non-angry and still remain an angry person if you don't discern the principle between non-angry and anger that can then free your mind from anger.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then, you won't be affected by anger.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What does that mean?

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Same, that's the most general, wholesome and unwholesome. All of these things, I'm talking about these examples, would come down to even a more general example, which is wholesome,

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:28,000
abandon everything unwholesome by discerning the relationship between wholesome and unwholesome.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Dependence, dependence, if you want to go higher, if you want to have high wisdom.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because seeing it gets wholesome is determined by the unwholesome.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
On a way, yeah, it is defined by it.

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's defined by it.

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, when you notice that, it leads you higher.

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's what many people are saying in the past, I don't know if you make somebody else think I'm a word of art.

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When you start keeping the precepts in the beginning, you have to keep the precepts.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But any of the wisdom starts to be developed through a practice.

32
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then, you don't keep them, they keep you. And the precepts are not about what the things you should be doing.

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's more about the behaviors that you're not doing. It's the negative aspect, that's what establishes you.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So, it's not you actively holding onto precepts, that kind of gives you a buffer zone and a boundary and a safety net.

35
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's things that you don't do, that you discern through doing the precepts.

36
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And what are the things that you don't do, unwholesome things? So, it's the negative behavior in regard to unwholesome things.

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's what defines that basis for practice.

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's exactly that thing. You can be wholesome in your life, but not discern relationship in your own home.

39
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because, in the heart of everything wholesome you do, there is the opposite possibility present as a phenomenon, as something that's not being done at the same time.

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, at the same time, there is something that's done which automatically defines something else as not done.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And that needs to be seen, because if you see that the thing that you don't do, and your mind that this signs it, then that becomes your establishment.

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then you don't have to do even what you were doing in order to maintain that establishment.

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now, it's simply you're not having to do anything is what establishes you. So, it's effortless.

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm not doing unwholesome. Not having to do unwholesome, but basically by discerning that you're not doing unwholesome, you don't have to do wholesome.

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's what I'm saying. That's how you get established.

46
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
By not discerning that you're not doing unwholesome, you have to actively keep doing wholesome, which means you don't go beyond the two.

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And by discerning what I'm talking about, you should discerning. That's how you're going to be on good and evil, as they would say.

48
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, by discerning that you're not doing evil, you don't have to do good.

49
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You could say, if you're getting it to establish your mind or matter, kindness, that's really not good.

50
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You establish matter by discerning the phenomenon of not engaging with the phenomenon of ill will.

51
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So, by doing not ill will, or other by not doing ill will, you establish loving kindness automatically.

52
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're not emulating all of fabricating or cultivating actively loving kindness.

53
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No, you do it in a negative way, in a sense of its recognition of negative things, of things that are not done.

54
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's what I mean by negative.

55
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's automatically that, which is not included in that, which is not done, is what's done.

56
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Because, in that example, kindness, if I wanted to develop kindness, and then I went out and, or what I kind of things to do, okay, smile at people, say good morning,

57
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and then you have to stay at the end of the final where you can help them. That's very different. That's a very different.

58
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That is better to do than being rude to be.

59
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, that's the first step.

60
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If somebody engages in ill will, it's good that they start doing the actual kindness.

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
By doing the actual kindness, they can start discerning that they're not doing the ill will.

62
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The more they descend, the phenomenon of ill will and their lack of engagement with it.

63
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The greater they get established in the opposite, which is non-air will, which is automatically kindness.

64
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So, then they don't have to keep bringing acts of kindness and emulating kindness in order to get the state of phenomenon of kindness,

65
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
because they automatically have it through the state of non-air will, that they have established.

66
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So, that's what I mean. You have to start fasting a bit or restraining yourself in regard to the food.

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
To then recognize that the state of non-heating is actually more fundamental than the state of eating.

68
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You spend far more time not eating than eating.

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You spend more time not engaging food than engaging food.

70
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yet, you give all the practice to the food. When the food is the food.

71
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So, you can have that in theory as much as you like, but you won't descend the principle until you actually start fasting to a degree.

72
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Restraining yourself, not constantly just chugging the food down the throat.

73
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Because then, you can start discerning that principle. Once you descend the principle, then yeah, you're going to have to keep holding on to your fasting and stuff,

74
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
because you will automatically be restraining in regard to the food.

75
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's basically the whole point of Sila. That's exactly the nature of it, and how you overcome it as a factor.

76
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Sila, about the Paramahasa, needs to be taken.

77
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But it is a factor.

78
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But it's a better factor than the factors of sensuality and everything else.

79
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So, you replace initially so that you can come out of it.

80
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And a solid burner would overcome Sila, about the Paramahasa.

81
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But what I'm telling you now, basically, but this description.

82
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
By taking it, in order to discern the principle in regard to the phenomenon of wholesome, phenomenon of wholesome,

83
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
when you are bound by your discernment, your full knowledge of the phenomenon of not wholesome, that's it.

84
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Then you're automatically wholesome, even if you don't actively, need optically, tightly, think about the actual things you must not do and the rules and whatever else.

85
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Then your behavior becomes naturally aligned with the rules.

86
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Give or take, obviously.

87
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But fundamentally, you can't do anything that's truly unwholesome.

88
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
In a sense, they will compromise the virtue.

89
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So, you know, an audience in the Suptus would sort of forget about the principle and then they would commit loads of offenses, as they would say, something's grave offenses.

90
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Really, all they would have to do is establish the principle and their purity is back.

91
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's whether the drunk and the sotpan is just drinking and drinking and not practicing.

92
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And then, oh, he composes man to the end of his life, basically, he recommends which is greater, death for life, death, which is greater, not eating or eating, not eating.

93
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Basically, he recommends that principle, which is greater, not drinking or drinking, which is greater, not sensuality or sensuality.

94
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
By recognizing, in mind, as established, sort of, celibacy or non-celibacy, exactly.

95
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because most people are basically not engaging in non-celibate acts.

96
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Most people would be celibate if you look at their behavior.

97
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
In a sense that they are not constantly engaging in sexuality, because, for example, they are not really celibate.

98
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because the mind is fully bound with centrality.

99
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But you would be celibate, well, first by taking the determination to be celibate, and then by discerning the principle, which is greater, which is more fundamental, and discerning the relationship between the two.

100
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And then, simply, by not engaging in centrality, you are a non-central person.

101
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I, you go beyond centrality.

102
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So, you actually go to guarding the doors of the senses.

103
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, basically, distraction, sensual distraction.

104
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Non-central, or non-distraction.

105
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Sure, sure, sure.

106
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Non-distraction.

107
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There is a sensual distraction, then there is a distraction that's a non-central distraction.

108
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No, you know, the more the say it is.

109
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And then, there is a non-distraction.

110
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So, you can't just leap from sensual distraction into a complete non-distraction.

111
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You have to replace sensual distraction with a non-central distraction.

112
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Which is basically holding onto views, and you, virtue, and you are celibate, but the Paramahasa would be a non-central distraction.

113
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Because it's still on the level of action.

114
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So, you have to do that in order to replace the variant wholesome, sensual distraction.

115
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
By not engaging in sensual distraction by body, by speech, you will eventually be able to not engage by mind.

116
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And you will be able to do so, why?

117
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because you then abandon.

118
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You overcome the non-central distraction.

119
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So, a non-central distraction cannot enter you.

120
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What can be said for that, which is even inferior to it, which is a sensual distraction that becomes inconceivable.

121
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's what it meant, like you replaced the grief of the household life with the grief of a renunciation of a life of a monk.

122
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You replaced the joys of household life with the joys of renunciation.

123
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You see it as greater, structurally, fundamentally, phenomenologically greater, as a phenomenon.

124
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's more fundamental.

125
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And saying, you will be abiding in a noble silence, simply by stopping you mid-sentence, if you want.

126
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You could establish your mind to that point.

127
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Whereby, yeah, you're not in silence when you're talking.

128
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The moment you stop talking, the mind goes back into silence.

129
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because it never left.

130
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But you can't do that if you never practice silence, if you never practice restraint of your speech.

131
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You've just been chatting and talking more constantly whenever there was an impulse to do so.

132
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But obviously, you certainly won't do that either if you just for the rest of your life refused to utter a word.

133
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That won't necessarily reveal you the principle between speaking and non-speaking.

134
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The verbal determination.

135
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's you trying to discern the principle, being pointed at it.

136
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That might make you help discern it.

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So that's why you can't put the proper practice of downloaded results in wisdom in any method or technique.

138
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Because it's not about what you do.

139
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's about the recognition between things that you do and you don't do.

140
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And that's neither where you do it nor where you don't do it.

141
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So you can't pin down the practice in a mere mechanical behavior or repetition or avoidance of certain things.

142
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, avoidance of unwholesome is necessary as a basis.

143
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But that's not the dumb end.

144
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The Buddha was quite clear.

145
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When he said, the Dhamma is not vineyard.

146
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's not vineyard.

147
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's as clear as many people have many monks can distinguish that.

148
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They think if there's no vineyard, there's no Dhamma.

149
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Dhamma is not vineyard.

150
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
A very clear statement.

151
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Followed by, but there is no practice of Dhamma without presence of vineyard.

152
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Without presence of urch.

153
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So aha, there is something to be understood there.

154
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You understand that, you will be free from silver parmas.

155
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You truly understand it.

156
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Which is basically what I'm expanding on here.

157
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's what I'm trying to explain.

158
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So your non-sensual behavior needs to become established.

159
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You need to actually do it.

160
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because by doing a non-sensual behavior,

161
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
you kind of the same time do the central behavior.

162
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But then, yeah, you can spend rest of your life.

163
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Your object can focus about your rules and virtue.

164
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And every descendant principle in regard to hold on.

165
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's not about me doing the virtue.

166
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
My virtue is actually defined by not doing the non-virtual.

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And that's a completely different thing.

168
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So that's why you can't put the practice into certain meditation

169
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
or just watch that to do this or walk like this.

170
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No.

171
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It makes no sense at all.

172
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
If it comes down to, if you recognize it actually,

173
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
what I'm supposed to do is descend the principle within hold on and hold on.

174
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's why the Buddha would like to mark up a job

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
that when she asked him to go on the retreat and give her a brief instruction.

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And all he said was, whatever you know is an awesome abandonment,

177
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
whatever you know is awesome, cultivated.

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So she went in the mountains based on that,

179
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
done the retreat and became another.

180
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So you could see that cultivating unhulsing,

181
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
sorry, cultivating wholesome means basically cultivating.

182
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's the descendant, the development, the bhavana, bringing it to being

183
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
until it's understood.

184
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Because she wasn't in the mountain and doing charity work

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
or some other wholesome things that people usually got as good.

186
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, she was completely secluded.

187
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So when it's said to be cultivating wholesome means yeah,

188
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
you don't do unhulsing.

189
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You're already cultivating wholesome.

190
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
When you know that that's what you're doing.

191
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you're unaware of the principle,

192
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
then by not doing unhulsing,

193
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
you're automatically wholesome.

194
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So you don't have to then do wholesome.

195
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If you don't listen to that principle,

196
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you remain bound by wholesome.

197
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Consequently, you remain bound by unhulsing.

198
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's why she adherence to the rules and virtue

199
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
can result in good rebirth because you've been doing good actions.

200
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But it cannot take you outside of the sphere of karma,

201
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
sphere of action.

202
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's only reserved for those with the right people,

203
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
which is where the download begins,

204
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
with the right view begins.

205
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So if you was in relation to that,

206
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
the system, when people come and ask me questions that

207
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
they don't focus, don't think you can put it in a technique or something.

208
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And they say, I find it helpful or something.

209
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's not your criteria of what's helpful.

210
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's not right.

211
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Or it's not existing very often.

212
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So what's helpful is just what feels good for most people.

213
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Because if you're adhered to something,

214
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
you think this is what I should be doing.

215
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Basically, that's the definition of silabata paramasa.

216
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's what you end UT.

217
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I need to be doing this.

218
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And that's the first factor.

219
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The first factor that prevents you from becoming another.

220
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So if a person has some transparency,

221
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
they'll think, okay, so I can either adhere to this neurotic link

222
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
for rest of my life and do this technique and what not.

223
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And remain a putlujena.

224
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Or I can really figure out what it meant by that.

225
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
These are the words of the Buddha.

226
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The silabata paramasa, it's basically a definition of

227
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
virtue in UT.

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's the first factor.

229
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is it?

230
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If I just read that,

231
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
because you should put each,

232
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
please attention to objects,

233
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
from pleasure, in the morning, in the afternoon.

234
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And even I read that, I think, I should do that.

235
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Or what is the object of a body?

236
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Do you know what the object is?

237
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, you know, take a wholesome.

238
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Exactly.

239
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
As opposed to the unwholesome I might do.

240
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Exactly.

241
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So you can call that object as well.

242
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But most people, what is an object?

243
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Well, I don't know.

244
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A smiley face, a clay pot, a Buddha root, or something.

245
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Give me an object.

246
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Give me something, but no.

247
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
A recognition of one wholesome,

248
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
if that's your present thought,

249
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
is the object that you can focus on.

250
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
As a result of it,

251
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
you will discern the relationship between the wholesome.

252
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's automatically defined,

253
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
simply by not engaging in unwholesome.

254
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So another thing I was thinking about,

255
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
is that, in terms of that.

256
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If one sees it,

257
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not engaging in unwholesome acts,

258
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
therefore I dwell in wholesomeism.

259
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Quite.

260
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's a peaceful state,

261
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and I think, too,

262
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
it's kind of distilled.

263
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

264
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, I see.

265
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay.

266
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, one is determined by the other.

267
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But that says that neither are mine.

268
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah.

269
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Exactly.

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So.

271
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So I think what is higher then?

272
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What is the higher perception then?

273
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's what I'm talking about.

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's going beyond good and bad.

275
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So the higher perception is self.

276
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Not so.

277
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Sure.

278
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Fundamentally.

279
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But that is already the result only for the right view.

280
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Not so.

281
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Appetitions can have higher perceptions

282
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
in regard to sensuality.

283
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
In regard to virtue and duties,

284
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
all view padanas,

285
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
that they can feel themselves from.

286
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
In regard to views.

287
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But they can't have a higher perception

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
in regard to self and not self.

289
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If they do so,

290
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
they'll be from the South of America.

291
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But it is exactly.

292
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's what I'm talking about.

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The discernment of the relationship

294
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
of wholesome and wholesome

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
takes you above wholesome and wholesome.

296
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Takes you above things that you were doing.

297
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Takes you above action.

298
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Which means it cannot be appropriate.

299
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Because only things that you can do are appropriate.

300
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Things on that level are things

301
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
that are regarded as mine, for me, as myself.

302
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Things that you can access as even a

303
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
rudimental levels of control.

304
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's that that that sense of

305
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
fulfilled is necessary basis for a sense of self.

306
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It is the sense of self.

307
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So when you go beyond the terms of the discernment of

308
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
that relationship,

309
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
that means that neither that unwholesome,

310
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
well, that means that you would see that,

311
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
yeah, wholesome is defined by that,

312
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
which is not done in terms of unwholesome.

313
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And continually unwholesome

314
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
is the absence of wholesome.

315
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So there is no need for you to hold on to anything.

316
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Those things define itself.

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's why it's the terminations.

318
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's why ignorance of that,

319
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
the termination relationships

320
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
results in a preparation of things.

321
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's where VJ is the first.

322
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Non-ignorance of that relationship

323
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
results in disarmament of ownership of that relationship.

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So you don't know neither good or bad.

325
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We don't have to hold some of our hosts.

326
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We go beyond it.

327
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Because your actions are completely unnecessary redundant.

328
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There is no room for that.

329
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Unwholesome is defined by wholesome.

330
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Wholesome is the absence of unwholesome.

331
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But obviously for as long as your behavior has been engaging

332
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
in unwholesome, you've been perpetuating that mistake,

333
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
maintaining that mistake in view.

334
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But if you can see self.

335
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And not hold even to yourself.

336
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Then it's automatically not self.

337
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But self is still there, there's something actually not holding.

338
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, it's not yourself there.

339
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Because self is defined not but what is there.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Self is defined by weather but there is being held as mine or not.

341
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So by seeing self as something there that means it's already

342
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
can be regarded as not mine.

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Just see what I mean.

344
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So that's ends of self, there would be there if seen as not self.

345
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Sorry, there's not mine.

346
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
First thing needs to be acknowledged is ends of self.

347
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
If you deny there's not self, there's not self.

348
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You never see that which is yourself.

349
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Why does that seem?

350
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's not seen as a phenomenon.

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If it's a phenomenon, it's something that has a reason.

352
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If it's something that has a reason, it cannot be that master

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
behind the horizon, behind the manifestation, that controller.

354
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Why?

355
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Because it's manifest.

356
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It just partakes in the same thing.

357
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It shares the same nature.

358
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's not mine.

359
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, but that's possible to see only once.

360
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, there is higher.

361
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Then.

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Then mine.

363
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And self.

364
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So in a way you can use that reflection like which is great

365
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and not mine or mine.

366
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
In general.

367
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And what is more?

368
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Things that don't belong to you, things that belong to you.

369
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Of course, things that don't belong to me are far more numerous in this world.

370
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That is greater than things that belong to you.

371
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Then you can use simply that discernment on a quite mundane level in a way

372
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and actually develop your mind and account of it.

373
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Because if you stick to it discerning it, you would see that then whatever is yours,

374
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
it's completely gratuitously accidentally solved.

375
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Which means you are not in control of things that are taking to be yours.

376
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Which means, oh, they're not really mine.

377
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Basically, things that are yours are really things that are not yours that are just closer to you.

378
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
They're things that are really not not yours.

379
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So it's not like, oh, this is not mine and this is mine.

380
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's like, this is not mine, not not mine and this is not mine.

381
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But fundamentally, none of it is yours.

382
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
All of it is not mine.

383
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But then for an hour and a half.

384
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Not mine. It's higher than that.

385
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Because not mine is opposed to mine.

386
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, that's what an Aryan needs to keep doing.

387
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That's why he said, not I am, not mine, not myself.

388
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That's the reflection of Aryan needs to be here.

389
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He doesn't even need to do it anymore.

390
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It sees completely notions of mine and not mine.

391
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Notions of course, some of them are false.

392
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Notions of good and bad have gone.

393
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You went beyond.

394
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's a path he might be on.

395
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So what is the highest determination?

396
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Determination that he, I don't know what I'm trying to say.

397
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What is the highest?

398
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Nibbam is ours.

399
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

400
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What is the highest thing he sees?

401
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This is determined by that.

402
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
This is determined by that.

403
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, that's what he sees.

404
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Well, it's gone.

405
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Determinations have ceased.

406
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Determinations have ceased.

407
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yes, exactly. Determinations have ceased.

408
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And that's determined by all his previous efforts towards ceasing the terminations.

409
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But that's gone.

410
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's irreversible.

411
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So there is nothing dependent on...

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That's the undetermined.

413
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Nibbana.

414
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Assam kata, yeah.

415
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's the definition of exactly.

416
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There's nothing dependent on anything anymore.

417
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Nothing taken as mine.

418
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Anywhere, anywhere in any manner.

419
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And I say before, oh, come on.

420
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It was the better we could.

421
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Mine anymore.

422
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
No, no.

423
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
He doesn't need to say it.

424
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

425
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And about life and death.

426
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So, would you say that?

427
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Here's life.

428
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Here's activity.

429
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Or what is higher than that?

430
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What is greater than that?

431
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah, death.

432
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Death would be more fundamental.

433
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah.

434
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Because if life would be full, more fundamental,

435
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
death would just not be manifested today.

436
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
See, but there's something different as, like, say, with anger and don't anger.

437
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Well, it's different because it kind of involves you in your entirety.

438
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Anger and not anger offers you some perspective.

439
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's kind of, but this is life and not life.

440
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So, I can't stop doing life.

441
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Life and death are basically on the level of nibbana and not nibbana.

442
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Determine.

443
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Determine and undetermine.

444
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah.

445
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But in the same manner, I say, like, the fact,

446
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
if you recognize that you can die at any moment,

447
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
then your whole life,

448
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
anything you pass, your future, your hopes, everything, your fears, your desires,

449
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
everything, everything, your family, everything,

450
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
it just becomes quite insignificant.

451
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Because you don't know.

452
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's the whole go away and you cannot possibly prevent it in any manner.

453
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
If you truly contemplate death, you realize how circumstantial your entire life is.

454
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
There is no greatness or priority of your own or certain personal life.

455
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Completely, it could have been otherwise.

456
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That's the recognition.

457
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm like, oh, the one that the Buddha created is already.

458
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It could not be for me.

459
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It will not be for me.

460
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And then the Buddha corrected in saying,

461
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
you won't be for me.

462
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It will not be for me.

463
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
As in the greatest of the potuginous views,

464
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
they would have said, it could have not been for me.

465
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Which is kind of, basically, almost a month, the entire life.

466
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You don't quite get the whole relationship thing between the Sankara and Sankata down,

467
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
between the determined.

468
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But you can abandon a lot.

469
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But the one who gets the rest,

470
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
he will say, it will not, if not for sure,

471
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
then in the future won't be for him, because there is no room for the ownership

472
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
in the present, not in the past, not in the future.

473
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So he corrects that statement just slightly.

474
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Like, from a first person to a third person,

475
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I have to go out in a long time.
