1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What are you saying? Anywhere around the corner?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, the whole work from a cherry.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's the way of life.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh yeah.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The way of the gods.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, the way of the gods.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The way of the gods.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The way of the gods.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the more you know.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The cleaner, the more virtues, the loftier.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The more kind life.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The human life is led.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It becomes more godlike.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The more proliferated, the more based on senses,

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
revolving around senses,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
observed in the senses,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
more animal-like is.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Based around sensual pleasures and gratification

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and so on.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's more like animals.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So that's why the human choice,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
based on which you perform certain actions,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
also not kind of determines

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
your future sort of direction.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Because it's a sort of realm

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in between.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It gives you glimpse about,

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you know, animals don't have much,

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
they're fully responsible,

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but they don't have much choice.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And they certainly can't behave like gods.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They can sometimes exhibit human-like behaviour,

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
which is already a big step forward for them anyway.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, wow, look at that.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And also, when they are good for gods,

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
they can't behave.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's harder for them to behave like animals.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But for human being kind of in between,

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
you can get both,

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
which is why the distinction is clear to you,

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
which is why the human realm

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
has both suffering and pleasure

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
to such an extent that it's most optimal

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
for practice.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You get both, you can really recognize.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Animals are just so deeply in pain, basically.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Constant drive, constant fear,

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
constant need,

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
no much reflection,

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
so they don't really know anything better.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Gods, on the other hand,

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
are usually between intoxicated with pleasure

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and no one's never experienced pain,

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
so they don't stop and think about it.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Human realm is exposed to both,

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and you kind of have the threat of the pain

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
of the suffering,

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but then you do have pleasure and gratification,

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
which is also valid, valid phenomenon.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And that's like the most optimal

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to really develop wisdom.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's really, really, really spectacular,

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
not just the animal,

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
just to watch a god, you know?

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Just to see how agitated it is.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can't, like, you know, when you train,

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
when you train a dog,

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
in order to get into the list,

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
you have to get his attention.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So then through little repetition and training,

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you keep learning how to get his attention,

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and that's when you're telling one command

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and you always listen.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But you realize how quickly that attention changes,

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and you know sometimes there's no point saying now,

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't have, like, something else has taken.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Obviously, the well-trained dog

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
would be able to be snacked out

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
of whatever has taken his attention,

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
no matter what.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But that requires, you know,

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
obviously it depends on the breed

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and the skill of the trainer and so on.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But it already was,

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and when you do that,

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you notice how that attention

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
is just all over the place constantly.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sound, sound, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell,

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
sound, sound, sound,

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
around the left, right, back,

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ah, something agitates, jump, calm, hungry,

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
constantly, just constantly.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And that's the anyway,

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you know, you look at the little cute little bird,

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you look at it,

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's just constant terror,

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
constant threats,

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
just keeps looking around, switching,

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
buzzing, switching,

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
because next moment,

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
it might be very last,

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
do some attack or something.

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Either birds,

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
other prey,

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
preying animals,

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think,

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
things of that nature.

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So you're just constantly,

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and that's the anyway though,

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
constant struggle,

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
constant fight,

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
constant survival.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You do?

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Like yet?

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well, the other day will.

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And for some people,

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
like to get into,

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
like you hear this whole,

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
getting into contact with the animal spirit

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and stuff, I guess,

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that hold it.

124
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, that's ridiculous.

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You know, as you,

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that the lion,

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
just gets, you know,

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
the lion's got no feel.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can use the similar,

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you can say,

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the lion is the fearless,

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you become fearless,

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
but you don't emulate a lion.

134
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, you don't.

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Because what else is lion?

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's a killer,

137
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
it's a murderer,

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
it's a rapist,

139
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
if that's what lions are.

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Or when people glorify animals,

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
as if they kind of have some deeper,

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
six cents that we don't have.

143
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah, they have their own ways

144
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
of perception, sure.

145
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You know, they can detect

146
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
subtly things,

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
better smells,

148
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but that's the thing.

149
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's not necessarily,

150
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it's not better,

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it's actually more proliferated,

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
more particular,

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
more based upon it,

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
which means less reflection of power

155
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
you have in regard to your senses,

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
more you pull,

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
driven,

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
constant drive.

159
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's what animals are like.

160
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So this whole kind of, you know,

161
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
one with a nature,

162
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
like I'm a snow into fear,

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
with a nature self.

164
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, that's quite silly actually,

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
because nature is what some sort of is.

166
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Nature wants you to stay ignorant.

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Nature is ignorant,

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and it's all about ignorance.

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So it's not the getting in touch

170
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
with nature,

171
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
becoming one with nature,

172
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
means becoming one with your ignorance,

173
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
fully endorsing it,

174
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
as a valid,

175
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
as a valid thing that should be

176
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
cherished and protected.

177
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because nature is what it is,

178
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and what it is,

179
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it's affected with religion.

180
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So going against the stream

181
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
means going against the nature.

182
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, sure.

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The nature of the body

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is to run after its like,

185
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
senses,

186
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and that's what the super sick,

187
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
senses,

188
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
five senses are like five wild animals,

189
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
they have their feeding grounds,

190
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and that's all they want to do.

191
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They just want to go

192
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and feed in their own feeding grounds.

193
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Eyes will pull you towards sides,

194
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
nose will pull you towards mouth,

195
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
ears will pull you to the inside,

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and that's what your senses are,

197
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and that's what nature is.

198
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So you actually go against that,

199
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
against the stream,

200
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
against the grain.

201
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you going against the nature

202
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
or are you understanding

203
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
nature for what it is?

204
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, that means going against the nature.

205
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Obviously, you know,

206
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
there are different ways you can understand

207
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
going against the nature.

208
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
People can just take that to mean

209
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
denying the nature,

210
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
but again,

211
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
in order to deny something,

212
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
that thing has to be accepted first,

213
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
which means denial of rebellion

214
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
against nature is just confirmation of the nature.

215
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Full understanding,

216
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
on the other hand,

217
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
is truly going against it,

218
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
like overcoming it,

219
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
swimming against the stream.

220
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, yeah, sure.

221
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Going against needs to be

222
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
clarified,

223
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
like individually,

224
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and understood correctly,

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
whereas everything else

226
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:37,000
could be things to done.

227
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
One thing is,

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
once a person

229
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
has entered the stream,

230
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
sort of on a

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
three-metre era,

232
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
on someone has achieved sort of

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
one that's a guarantee

234
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
that he wouldn't do a lot,

235
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but he wouldn't fall back to ignore us.

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So, what do you mean exactly,

237
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
but fall back,

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
before and after fall back?

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He would.

240
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He can't unbecome,

241
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
a sort of one.

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He can't become profusion again.

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He can't have

244
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the personality view anymore.

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He can't.

246
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No.

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But anything below that,

248
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
we can break all the precepts,

249
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
despite the popular belief.

250
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He can, you know,

251
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
break all the precepts.

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He cannot practice at all.

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But it will require

254
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
a lot of carelessness,

255
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
lots of exposure to unwholesome circumstances

256
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
for him to go that bad,

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
because he inherently possesses

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
a criteria of wholesome,

259
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and has that permanently available view,

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
right view,

261
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that he can effortlessly engage in.

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So, it's quite unlikely,

263
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
but it's possible,

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
as they were case in the

265
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
cities of Adhrankin,

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sotapana and so on.

267
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We spoke about it before,

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think I spoke there with Tonya.

269
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The Sotas mentioned clearly,

270
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
things that Sotapana cannot do,

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
which is hold anything,

272
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
any determination is permanent,

273
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
any determination is pleasurable,

274
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
anything to assume to be his self.

275
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He can't kill his mother,

276
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
he can't kill his father,

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
he can't kill an other hand,

278
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
he can't violate the killing,

279
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
can't disparage the Buddha,

280
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
or boom the Buddha,

281
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
can't take anybody else

282
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
other than the Buddha

283
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
as his teacher.

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Can I say that?

285
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's all.

286
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Change it.

287
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Can't take,

288
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't follow any other teacher.

289
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why?

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Because the Dharma is not just a view,

291
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
it's a recognition of the,

292
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
like a universal criteria,

293
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that it claims,

294
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
you know,

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
to recognize discern in your experience as a whole,

296
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
which means,

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
once you discern that,

298
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
those things are fundamental,

299
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
those things are universal.

300
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So that's confirmed,

301
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that becomes the core criteria for everything else.

302
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So whenever you come across any other view,

303
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
it's just going to be seen as either chords

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to the universal principle,

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
the right principle,

306
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
or it doesn't.

307
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So if you come across some other teaching,

308
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
as a Sotapani,

309
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you'll see,

310
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ah, this actually

311
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
accords to the principles of the Dharma.

312
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So this teaching is the Dharma.

313
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Or you'll see,

314
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you know,

315
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
it doesn't accord the Dharma

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
for such and such reasons,

317
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that's not Dharma.

318
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And by saying Dharma,

319
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
it refers to that universal principle.

320
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You don't have to call it Buddhism,

321
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
because often,

322
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
today, now,

323
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
modern Buddhism,

324
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
contemporary Buddhism,

325
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
there's nothing to do with the actual Dharma.

326
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is the views they have evolved,

327
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
wrong views,

328
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
wrong methods,

329
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
wrong principles,

330
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
wrong techniques.

331
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So it takes a religion,

332
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
product of society,

333
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
ignorance,

334
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and so on.

335
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But the Dharma

336
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
as a universal principle stands,

337
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and always will stand,

338
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
which is why liberation always remains possible.

339
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
As the Buddha says,

340
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
like, really discovering an ancient path,

341
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and he found the Dharma,

342
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
like that,

343
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
that has been worked before,

344
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
by others,

345
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
because he didn't create anything,

346
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
nor invent,

347
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
he rediscovered it,

348
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and then reformulated it.

349
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So anyone,

350
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that develops wisdom,

351
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but haven't attained,

352
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
a state,

353
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
could develop it,

354
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
no matter what level,

355
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
that they fall back to Sansaara,

356
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
continuously.

357
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, what do you mean by state?

358
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I mean, sort of unknown.

359
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

360
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Like,

361
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
putugenus wisdom,

362
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
unless he develops it enough,

363
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to cease to be a putugenus,

364
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
he remains at risk.

365
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's why as the Buddha pointed out,

366
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
a person really,

367
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
a genuine person,

368
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
a genuine interest in practice,

369
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
you really have to start thinking about,

370
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you know,

371
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
developing a right view,

372
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
as not an optional thing.

373
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's your duty to become a Sotapana.

374
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And all of your faculties,

375
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
reasoning,

376
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
powers of reflection are intact.

377
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You have no reason to not become a Sotapana,

378
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
except laziness and lack of effort,

379
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
lack of commitment,

380
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
lack of determination,

381
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and so on.

382
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Absolutely no reason.

383
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Family, children, wives,

384
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
husbands,

385
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
none of that is actual excuse.

386
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Obviously people make an excuse out of that,

387
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
so they won't feel guilty

388
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
on a kind of,

389
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
not following the way out.

390
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So they absolve themselves

391
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
from responsibility for,

392
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
for practice,

393
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
for determination,

394
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
for giving up,

395
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
because they say,

396
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
oh, well, I have a family,

397
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have duties and stuff.

398
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, it's a worldly duty,

399
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
but this pertains to something much more.

400
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So actually,

401
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the worldly duty can never serve

402
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
as a reason,

403
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
or as an excuse.

404
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It just might require more of your determination,

405
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
but then there is no excuse

406
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
for not having more determination.

407
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Unless your faculties are impaired,

408
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
you're mad,

409
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
they range to whatever else,

410
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
then there is actually an excuse

411
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
for not doing it.

412
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And if you stop and think about it,

413
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
how many times have you been reborn?

414
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You might not know,

415
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
but you can have a safe guess.

416
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And if you have faith in the Buddha

417
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and trusting his words,

418
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
he said how many times,

419
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
countless times,

420
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
eons, and eons,

421
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and eons,

422
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and eons of rebirth

423
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
in every possible realm

424
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
that there was,

425
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
there's nothing left,

426
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
unexperienced,

427
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
unexplored,

428
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
or anything like that,

429
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
so real as well.

430
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
From that point of view,

431
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and that's why the Buddha

432
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
would talk about that,

433
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
because from that point of view,

434
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
you can actually look

435
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
at this entire life differently,

436
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and real as well,

437
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
what is one life dedicated to Dharma?

438
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Nothing.

439
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because you know,

440
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
now something feels all right.

441
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, I can't give everything up

442
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
in this life

443
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and just go and practice,

444
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
because it just feels too much.

445
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, from the perspective

446
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
of only this life,

447
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
it feels too much.

448
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But if you start reflecting,

449
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
like from a greater point of view,

450
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you realize what is one life,

451
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
dedicated in one life,

452
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
succeeding,

453
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
maybe failing,

454
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
maybe partially succeeding.

455
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Well, at least you know you try.

456
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Because you know,

457
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
you can believe in rebirth or not,

458
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
or whatever else.

459
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But the point is,

460
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
you don't know those things.

461
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
One thing you know for sure is,

462
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you will die.

463
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And what if,

464
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the Buddha was right,

465
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
when he was talking about

466
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
rebirth and everything else,

467
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
are you willing,

468
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to kind of just better it,

469
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and gamble in it,

470
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and spend this life carelessly,

471
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
doing whatever you want,

472
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
whatever it pleases you,

473
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and then the Buddha turns out to be right,

474
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and then you end up much worse

475
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
for like thousands of beings.

476
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You know, the chances of coming back up,

477
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the human realm wants to fall lower

478
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
into any matter,

479
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
for example,

480
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
was like the blind seater,

481
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
so it comes out every 500 years,

482
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
it just comes out to the top of the sea,

483
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and goes down.

484
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So it doesn't linger.

485
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And then there is a yoke

486
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
with a piece of wood with a hole in it,

487
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
being thrown around by the, you know,

488
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
raised winds in the sea,

489
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
left and right everywhere.

490
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This turtle has a great chance of sticking its neck

491
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
through their little hole,

492
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
then somebody who is falling back

493
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
onto the animal realm has a chance

494
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
to come back on the human realm.

495
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So you consider that, and like again,

496
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
you can't have a empirical proof,

497
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
or give me a scientific,

498
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
but it's because science is all based on senses.

499
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You should expect it to experience

500
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
three senses as a proof

501
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that which precedes your senses,

502
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
rebuts and realms.

503
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But if you just allow it

504
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
as a valid possibility,

505
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you should then,

506
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
it will become obvious that

507
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the safe course of action would be,

508
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
well, let me assume that there is

509
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
just in case that there is.

510
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Because then, I'll be safe.

511
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Rather than gambling,

512
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and just deciding that there isn't,

513
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
because there is no more proof

514
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
that there is no rebirth,

515
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and there is a proof that there is rebirth.

516
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So people who say,

517
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
well, I don't believe in rebirth,

518
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
they are no more justified

519
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
than those who believe in it.

520
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So you won't accept both,

521
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and then reckon as well,

522
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't really know

523
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
whether there is or there isn't.

524
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Thus, I should act

525
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
just in case that there is.

526
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because if there is,

527
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll be much worse off

528
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
if I behave as if there isn't.

529
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wouldn't that be,

530
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
wouldn't that same argument be applied

531
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to a lot of different views?

532
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What do you mean?

533
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Like,

534
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
just anything like, you know,

535
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
whether it's

536
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
a view about how many persons,

537
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
or any sort of other philosophical

538
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
or religious view.

539
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Well, this is not really a philosophical view.

540
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This clearly pertains something that precedes

541
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
or comes after succeeds

542
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
after your existence that you know.

543
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Which means,

544
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
it's truly metaphysical.

545
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It can't be experienced.

546
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It can be speculated about.

547
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And that's what you reckon as.

548
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
This is inherently never,

549
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
can never go beyond the level of speculation.

550
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Thus, I should act

551
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
just in case,

552
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
choose a wise course of action.

553
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But, you know,

554
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
views whether there is suffering

555
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and there is freedom of suffering,

556
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
that's not metaphysical.

557
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's not like,

558
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you know,

559
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
that can be speculative,

560
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
but can also be proven

561
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
to yourself,

562
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
fully understood,

563
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
discerned,

564
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and confirmed.

565
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay.

566
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So is that,

567
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
especially like,

568
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
you know,

569
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
that is metaphysical?

570
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, exactly.

571
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And that's what the Buddha said.

572
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
When he said,

573
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
well, you don't know,

574
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
thus, you should act.

575
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And actually,

576
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
you don't even have to believe in it.

577
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can just use your reasoning right here

578
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and now that you do have,

579
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and just discern.

580
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, in case there is a label,

581
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
it's actually better to behave here.

582
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And then, plus,

583
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
if I do behave here,

584
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
people will like me here,

585
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
respect me here,

586
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
find me trustworthy here,

587
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
searchers person,

588
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and then they know they can rely on me.

589
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And then if there is a next life,

590
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
great,

591
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
then I win,

592
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
like on both accounts.

593
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I win here,

594
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I win in the next life.

595
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
If there is a next life,

596
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
well, so big,

597
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
then we all end up the same,

598
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but at least here,

599
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I live happily and respect you by others,

600
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and have my life smoother,

601
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
than if I'm a crook of criminal,

602
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and always worrying,

603
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
being caught,

604
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
or whatever else.

605
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So you really,

606
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
you don't need a proof for it.

607
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Just use your reasoning,

608
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and recognize that it's better to act as if there is.

609
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And that's all it matters,

610
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
how you act right here right now.

611
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It doesn't matter whether there is or there isn't.

612
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And that's why I brought this up,

613
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
because if you start thinking that it really is,

614
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
what is

615
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
dedicating this life then

616
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
to the practice of Dharma?

617
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's nothing.

618
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This is one life.

619
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Big deal.

620
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You'll be dead anyway,

621
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and you know that for sure.

622
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And not in 50 years,

623
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
might be much sooner,

624
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
might be much later.

625
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Point is,

626
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
it will happen.

627
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So it will come to an end.

628
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So having the spending your time pursuing

629
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
mundane goals,

630
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
of course,

631
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
just plain gratification

632
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
of your senses,

633
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
just scratching your itch.

634
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You know that,

635
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
even from the worldly point of view,

636
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
that it doesn't amount to anything more than that.

637
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And then you're dead.

638
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Then your senses start breaking up.

639
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You can't enjoy them anymore.

640
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Everything becomes rather unpleasant.

641
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Your hearing goes.

642
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Your body doesn't listen.

643
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Sickness sets in.

644
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And then you're dead.

645
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And how you spend the life,

646
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
being completely controlled by those five wild animals,

647
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
just yanking your left and right,

648
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
as they please.

649
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And now you're kind of stuck all too weak

650
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
to do anything better,

651
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and then you're dead.

652
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then if there is the next life,

653
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
then you'll be really, really screwed.

654
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Because there's obviously the

655
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
what I've heard,

656
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
common, you know,

657
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
just enjoy the life now.

658
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Is there anyone you can,

659
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
anyone you have,

660
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
just enjoy it.

661
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Do the best you can.

662
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Good time.

663
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Go out.

664
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And then.

665
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Great.

666
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But as I said,

667
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
you don't even have to wait for the next life,

668
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
or so you can see that,

669
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
that view and logic,

670
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
well, works, only body,

671
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
you have your health,

672
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
you have your youth,

673
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
you have your life.

674
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And none of those things

675
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
are guaranteed that you're going to have the very next moment.

676
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
All of them are based upon a gratuitous assumption

677
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
that you'll live forever,

678
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
or at least for a long time,

679
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and that you will always be healthy.

680
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, yeah, life is happening

681
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
so that you can go out and enjoy it.

682
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But what about the person who's

683
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
going to go out and enjoy it?

684
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Or what about you just next day,

685
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
you'll find you have cancer.

686
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Does it work?

687
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It doesn't work.

688
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How are you going to enjoy that?

689
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What happens to that view then,

690
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
when you realize,

691
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm subject to death,

692
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and now it's confirmed.

693
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And those of you,

694
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
that's a fact,

695
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
you're going to die,

696
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
what's going to happen afterwards as much.

697
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So what's the point?

698
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What's the point of life, you know,

699
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
you can just say,

700
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
if you have the view that this is all there is,

701
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you know,

702
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
you say they don't think very far

703
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
further than that, really.

704
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You know, because if you think further than that,

705
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
what,

706
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
then what's the point of anything?

707
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Is it really the point

708
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
just to be enjoying?

709
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Again, as I was just said,

710
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
like a few minutes ago,

711
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm saying,

712
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
like those people having a view,

713
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
this is all there is,

714
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
well,

715
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
that's something you decided,

716
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
as a view,

717
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you don't know that for a fact.

718
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So you're no more justified in deciding that,

719
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
than deciding,

720
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
you know, this isn't all there is.

721
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And as it turns out,

722
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
you're less justified,

723
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
why?

724
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because that's much,

725
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
less,

726
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
much riskier,

727
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
course of assumption,

728
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
or this is all there is,

729
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
to which you can,

730
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
while you can.

731
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And then you realize,

732
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
well, what if this isn't all there is,

733
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and all my time that I had,

734
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I spent misbehaving

735
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and just running after like an animal,

736
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
after any gratification I could get?

737
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Then you end up much worse.

738
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So you want to consider it,

739
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
that you don't know,

740
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
whether this is all there is,

741
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
thus it's better to act,

742
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
as if it isn't all there is.

743
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Why?

744
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Because if there is something afterwards,

745
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
those people who do say that

746
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
there is something afterwards,

747
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
they say,

748
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
because of that,

749
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
you should behave right here right now.

750
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And there is a good sense in that.

751
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And you can see that for yourself,

752
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
right here, right now,

753
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
even as a protuginous,

754
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
protuginous can see that as well.

755
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And then obviously,

756
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
if you want even more,

757
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
if you want to be free

758
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
from suffering right here,

759
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
right now,

760
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
let alone any future,

761
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
instances,

762
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
then yeah,

763
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
you have to apply yourself even harder,

764
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
but again,

765
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
it comes from the,

766
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
from the same perspective,

767
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
except in the fact,

768
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
well rather,

769
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
recognizing the fact,

770
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
that one thing is sure is,

771
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you will grow sick,

772
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
age and dying.

773
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That's it.

774
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So, you know,

775
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
spend your life enjoying your senses,

776
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
works when you're 20-year-old,

777
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
when you think you live forever.

778
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Mind you,

779
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
you can be 50-year-old

780
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and still say that,

781
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
because you think you live forever,

782
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and you're healthy at the time.

783
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But find your sick person,

784
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
in a hospital,

785
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
bedridden,

786
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
saying that,

787
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
holding that view.

788
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh yeah,

789
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
enjoy your life.

790
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This is great.

791
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
See,

792
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and I'm still alive,

793
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
bedridden in a hospital,

794
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
oozing out,

795
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
whatever I,

796
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I don't know,

797
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
depending on the illness,

798
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I guess.

799
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And,

800
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and that person,

801
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
would they be saying,

802
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
oh yeah,

803
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
enjoy your senses while you,

804
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
while you're still alive?

805
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They might be telling others that.

806
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well, they might,

807
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
oh see,

808
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
now I'm sick,

809
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
really make the most of it.

810
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And they might listen

811
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
because the others are not sick.

812
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
They're intoxicated

813
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
with health.

814
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And you know that,

815
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
for yourself,

816
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
everybody experienced

817
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
that more or less,

818
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
when you're healthy,

819
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
you don't care,

820
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
when you get sick,

821
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
then you get all really worried,

822
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
and then you're,

823
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
oh,

824
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and you got sick

825
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
because of your stupidity

826
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
or foolishness,

827
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and then you make all those grand,

828
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
they think, oh,

829
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
never did that again.

830
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And then you recover,

831
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and then you're back

832
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
to the old ways

833
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
you completely forgot.

834
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's pure intoxication.

835
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's what you have at the time.

836
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's like,

837
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
complete,

838
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
like the mindfulness.

839
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Absence.

840
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And saying,

841
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
you make grand plans

842
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and projects,

843
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and ideas,

844
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and hopes,

845
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and whatever else,

846
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
just because you assume

847
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
you will live forever,

848
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
you assume your life

849
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
will last for a long time.

850
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And if you stop

851
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and think about that assumption,

852
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
it's completely gratuitous.

853
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
As every assumption is,

854
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
but this one,

855
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:35,000
it really can hit you.

856
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So, as Buddha said,

857
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
even if somebody went for,

858
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and they don't achieve anything,

859
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
but they don't disrupt the state,

860
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
they keep the rules,

861
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and they keep trying to practice.

862
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Even if they don't get anywhere,

863
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
even if they spend every single day,

864
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
for the rest of their life,

865
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
in tears, in pain,

866
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
imposed by the restraint,

867
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
it's still better than going back.

868
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Why?

869
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Because you've been around so long,

870
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
so many times,

871
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
it's spending

872
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
a third of your lifetime now,

873
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
crying in pain,

874
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
but holding that restraint,

875
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
will actually contribute much more,

876
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
than just giving in to the senses.

877
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And then, at the same time,

878
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
we stop thinking,

879
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
well, it's impossible to spend every single day,

880
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
for the rest of your life,

881
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
in tears, in pain.

882
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
No matter how great that pain is,

883
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
it will fade.

884
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But if you're ready for every single day of pain,

885
00:27:40,000 --> 00:28:07,000
anything less than that will be a blessing.

886
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And people, nobody likes this strain,

887
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
because it feels like a chore.

888
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It feels like an effort.

889
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And it feels like that,

890
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
only from the point of view,

891
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
where your sensuality feels effortless.

892
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Now, the actual gratification of the senses,

893
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
might feel effortless,

894
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
but it never comes on its own.

895
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It always comes with a price.

896
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And it's not seeing the connection

897
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
between sensuality and gratification

898
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and the price and the toll it takes.

899
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You reflect on the connection long enough,

900
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and it would become apparent

901
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
because it is there.

902
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And then you realize,

903
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it's much harder,

904
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
much more taxing,

905
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
much more,

906
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
much more of a chore,

907
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
to be following your senses,

908
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and enjoying them,

909
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
then saying no to the whole thing.

910
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But that connection needs to be well on long enough

911
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
until it becomes apparent,

912
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
because it's not apparent,

913
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
because if it were apparent so easily,

914
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
everybody would be free from sensuality.

915
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And you can start with a simple reflection of,

916
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
if you are a layperson,

917
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
living a household life,

918
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
enjoying the pleasures of your senses,

919
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
means pleasant pastes,

920
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
touches sounds,

921
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
finding a pleasant wife,

922
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
or a girlfriend,

923
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
living a pleasant life.

924
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
How do you achieve that?

925
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You need to work.

926
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You need to earn.

927
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You need to really

928
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
put up with stuff you don't like,

929
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
very often.

930
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You might find the work you like,

931
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
you might be your own boss,

932
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
but then you have to protect it.

933
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You have to fend off.

934
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
People who want the same.

935
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
People who cheated,

936
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
people who lie,

937
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and people want to take things away from you.

938
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So there's always that risk.

939
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Then you're committing your life to it.

940
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You're spending 90% of doing things

941
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
you don't want,

942
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
just so you get that 5% enjoyment.

943
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It doesn't feel directly related to it,

944
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and that's the ignorance,

945
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
obscuring it.

946
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But if you realize that it's impossible

947
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
to have enjoyment,

948
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
without 95% of pain revolving around it,

949
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
directly or indirectly,

950
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
you realize that enjoyment is not worth it.

951
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And that's when the Buddha talks about

952
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
seeing the danger

953
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
in the sensuality.

954
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So by choosing to pursue

955
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
the ways of the senses,

956
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
which is basically choosing to have family,

957
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
children, wives or husbands,

958
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
whatever else,

959
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
living that kind of life,

960
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
you accept that whole central domain

961
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
with these things pertain,

962
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
with these things are,

963
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
which means you don't practice restraint,

964
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
but you practice pursuit.

965
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And that's a form of commitment.

966
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Pursuing your senses is a form of commitment,

967
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but then you realize,

968
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
by accepting, by engaging in that pursuit,

969
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
you make yourself liable

970
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
to a great loss.

971
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So say, you commit yourself to a pursuit

972
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
of having a family,

973
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
having children.

974
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Well, now that you have family and children,

975
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
you have to work harder for them.

976
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
For the food, for the clothing, for the school.

977
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What if they get sick?

978
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What if they die on you?

979
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You spent 20, 30 years,

980
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
cultivating, investing in those things,

981
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
dedicating your whole life,

982
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
praising your children,

983
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
then they turn away on you,

984
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
or they die, or an accident happened,

985
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and they just snatched away

986
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
in a second,

987
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
and you have not had say in that

988
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
from the beginning.

989
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Like, from the day one,

990
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
you have no say in the destiny of your child.

991
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Well, you have no say in your own destiny,

992
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
but you have ignored that

993
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
when you decided to pursue the senses.

994
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But if you reflect on that,

995
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you realize that even the pursuit of the senses

996
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
is actually completely out of your hands.

997
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That's why the suitors compare it to climbing a tree.

998
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh, you see the ripe mangoes

999
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
on the tree, so you climb the tree

1000
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
to eat them, to enjoy them.

1001
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And then somebody else while you're on top of that tree

1002
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
comes, and he can't climb the tree,

1003
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
so he decides to cut it.

1004
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
While you're still on the top,

1005
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
he doesn't see or he doesn't care.

1006
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You chop the tree, you fall down, break in there,

1007
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and you're done.

1008
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And pursue the senses

1009
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
exposes you to that,

1010
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
means going down, or climbing up the tree,

1011
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
off a kind,

1012
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
or the other,

1013
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and something might come at a direct cross-purpose

1014
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and just snatch it away from you.

1015
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Be it an accident, being other people,

1016
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
being both.

1017
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Who knows?

1018
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The point is, the exposure is there.

1019
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So there is the inherent danger in that pursuit.

1020
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So you realize that danger is 95% of luck.

1021
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Easy worth risking your life,

1022
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
putting your head on a chopping block

1023
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
when there is a good chance of accident falling down,

1024
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
just so you get that 5% thrill.

1025
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And in this worth,

1026
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
that gratification is worth

1027
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
for as long as you don't establish that connection

1028
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
between the two.

1029
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I, for as long as you don't see the danger in centrality.

1030
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You establish the connection

1031
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and then the danger became apparent.

1032
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
The visible.

1033
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The mind turned away.

1034
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Spear is the passion.

1035
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
As the suit is described.

1036
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh, like the disgust became real.

1037
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
This is danger.

1038
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
This is not like mind turned away.

1039
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Never to go back to it.

1040
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Why?

1041
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Because it is like that.

1042
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Essentiality and gratification

1043
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
would not inherently be dangerous

1044
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and risky,

1045
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and much more revolving around pain

1046
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
in this satisfaction.

1047
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
If it wouldn't be inherently that,

1048
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
then it wouldn't be unholy.

1049
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And that certainly freedom from it would not be possible.

1050
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But because it is inherently dangerous, risky,

1051
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and not worthy,

1052
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
it is inherently like that.

1053
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But dwelling on that freedom from it is possible.

1054
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And then you realize,

1055
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
saying no as a formal restraint to centrality,

1056
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it's 5% of effort,

1057
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
95% of peace,

1058
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and it's well worth it.

1059
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And that's when you find,

1060
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
when a person finds pleasure over renunciation,

1061
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
like actually you experience pleasure

1062
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
by being, by recognizing strength

1063
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
that you have of saying no,

1064
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
not being you are stronger than senses,

1065
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
senses are not stronger than you.

1066
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There's also a view that you will actually

1067
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
through those challenges in life.

1068
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
If you're having a family in the child,

1069
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
you will get to know yourself.

1070
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah.

1071
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You will evolve.

1072
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You will evolve in a way,

1073
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
in a discovering different ways

1074
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
of pursuing the senses.

1075
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But whether you evolve this way or that way,

1076
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
bottom line is,

1077
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
it's still within the nature of pursuing the senses,

1078
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and that's still within the nature of their danger and risk.

1079
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Does any evolving that you do

1080
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
will be within that?

1081
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's basically like going in a muddy swamp

1082
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
and finding different ways

1083
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
to wash yourself with a muddy water.

1084
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
No matter how liberated your ways become,

1085
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
it's still filled with water.

1086
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Means you'll never be clean.

1087
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Evolving the same way.

1088
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Evolving.

1089
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Like, you can be in prison.

1090
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
In prison, behind a low door.

1091
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Sure, you can evolve in that environment.

1092
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Whatever evolving you do,

1093
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
it will be evolving in the prison.

1094
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But you really want to be out of the prison.

1095
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's better to be uninvolved out of the prison

1096
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
than involved in very common sense in the prison.

1097
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Because that's not really involvement.

1098
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's just a further proliferation.

1099
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And it's people say that they never say

1100
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
for any other sense,

1101
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
any other purpose than a purpose of justifying their pursuit

1102
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
of the senses upon which they already decided.

1103
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But now they need to keep justifying it.

1104
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And sure, you can.

1105
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But you do that to others

1106
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
because you might feel guilty,

1107
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
or you might feel watched or judged.

1108
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So you justify yourself.

1109
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But basically,

1110
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that's done already when you're deeply committed to the senses.

1111
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So now you're just trying to make the best out of it.

1112
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Cover up any doubt in regard to your choices,

1113
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
in regard to your commitment.

1114
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Above all, observe all the responsibility for it.

1115
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh, well, you know, I can't.

1116
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I can't go forth now because I have wife and children.

1117
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Well, they were not given to you,

1118
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
like, you know, out of nowhere.

1119
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You've chosen that.

1120
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So basically what you're saying,

1121
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
you can't go forth because of the choices you make.

1122
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And the choices that you're still accepting.

1123
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And that means you can't go forth

1124
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
because you're choosing to not go forth.

1125
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That's it.

1126
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh, if you put it like that,

1127
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
you realize I'm so responsible for them going forth,

1128
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
for not practicing the Dharma.

1129
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So saying, oh, well, you evolve,

1130
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
you grow as a fight by engaging in these challenges.

1131
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's like, well, you really grow

1132
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
by recognizing how to completely overcome those challenges

1133
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
so they don't rise.

1134
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Why would you keep yourself in the environment

1135
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
where those challenges will be coming the over?

1136
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's silly.

1137
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Surely the wisdom is finding a place

1138
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
that's free from any challenge.

1139
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But only a person who doesn't know how to free himself

1140
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
from their challenges will say,

1141
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
no, no, no, challenges are good.

1142
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
They only say that because they don't know how to escape

1143
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and how to overcome them.

1144
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So they need to make himself feel important

1145
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
or more valuable than they actually are.

1146
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I remember we spoke a while back about seeing an attractive thing.

1147
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I see.

1148
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
We see an attractive object.

1149
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I can quite a bit.

1150
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It feels painful if I...

1151
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah.

1152
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So if I see a beautiful woman

1153
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
walking around in the city,

1154
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't try to drown this.

1155
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But I can see the beauty from the corner of my eye.

1156
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I don't have to look at it.

1157
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I can see it on the other side of the road.

1158
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And then I have to restrain myself.

1159
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But I was reflecting on the third of it.

1160
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That sign of beauty comes with pain somehow.

1161
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah.

1162
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That's what I was saying before.

1163
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
That sign of beauty is that which is painful.

1164
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's not the restraint.

1165
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yes, not the restraint.

1166
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Because when you say no to a prospect of pleasure

1167
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
that it's pulling you,

1168
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
whether it's a pleasurable sight,

1169
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
sound, smell or any other sense,

1170
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
it feels like the pain has a reason

1171
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
because you said no.

1172
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You finally go with it.

1173
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
No, the pain has a reason

1174
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
because you've been yanked by that enemy

1175
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
of that sense.

1176
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's just usually you immediately go with it

1177
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
so there is no yank.

1178
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Like as the leash starts pulling you,

1179
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
you go with it.

1180
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So there is no tension created.

1181
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So you just feel smooth sailing

1182
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
because you're just being driven.

1183
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
When you start reflecting on it,

1184
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
you sort of don't go instantaneously

1185
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and then there is a pain arising.

1186
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And you think, oh, this pain has a reason

1187
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
because I didn't go immediately

1188
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
with this animal that pulled me

1189
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and animal of sight.

1190
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
But actually, no.

1191
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You go step further and you realize no.

1192
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The pain has a reason

1193
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
because it's stupid.

1194
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The animal yanked me.

1195
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And for as long as I go with it,

1196
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
it will keep yanking

1197
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
because I'm allowing you to do it.

1198
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Same you take a dog on a leash

1199
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
you let it yank your arm

1200
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and that's what I get used to.

1201
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So instead of going with it,

1202
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
you invest the effort

1203
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
to overpower that yank

1204
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
so you actually control the animal.

1205
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And then eventually animal learns

1206
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
it's pointless to yank.

1207
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I won't be let go when I am.

1208
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And then it listens.

1209
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then it goes where you did it after to go.

1210
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But then that's what it is.

1211
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
But that needs to...

1212
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So yeah, the inevitable...

1213
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Oh, I've been yanked.

1214
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's because I didn't go with the animal as quickly

1215
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
as I should have.

1216
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But no, you've been yanked

1217
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
because the animal pulled you.

1218
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So you have to endure that initial pain

1219
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and also see through it

1220
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
as not originating from you saying no

1221
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
to the animal that started to run

1222
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
with you holding on to its chain.

1223
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
But it has a reason

1224
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
because the animal is wild.

1225
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The animal is untrained, the animal ends.

1226
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The eye goes towards that...

1227
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Exactly. The eye goes for the sights.

1228
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And that's what...

1229
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So when there is a pain of a pleasurable sight,

1230
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
it's because of the eye goes there

1231
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
not because you're saying no to it.

1232
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And you stick to saying no to it

1233
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
until eventually you overpower the eye

1234
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and it stops yanking here.

1235
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Because it realized it's pointless.

1236
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
You know, you tie the dog

1237
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
to a post.

1238
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It will yank and yank.

1239
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And then no, the post doesn't budge.

1240
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It doesn't break.

1241
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It will sit down and calm down.

1242
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And actually that's a super similar.

1243
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
When you, like a strong post,

1244
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
you tie this fire animals to the chain.

1245
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
They will go wild and try to pull the rope.

1246
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
When they come break it eventually,

1247
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
they'll quiet down and sit down.

1248
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And then you can take them off for a walk

1249
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and they'll be there.

1250
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Let the training of the senses.

1251
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Because with the eye,

1252
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
you're going into the city

1253
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
where it likes pretty girls, beautiful women.

1254
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And like I said, now,

1255
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
you can see that it's not yours

1256
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
because you realize

1257
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
that you're all of a sudden

1258
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
you're looking at this pretty girl

1259
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
on the outside of the road.

1260
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But the whole time, your attention,

1261
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
your intention was, say,

1262
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
you're looking at the pavement,

1263
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
following you or whatever.

1264
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And then all of a sudden my head turns,

1265
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
my vision turns to that specific thing,

1266
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
which I can say.

1267
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I can say, yeah, that's attractive.

1268
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
From the hundreds of people walking around.

1269
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
We're not attractive.

1270
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
We're not a joke.

1271
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I picked the one which I'm not even looking at.

1272
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm not attractive.

1273
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It's because my eye is not mine.

1274
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's seen more than what I'm looking at.

1275
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The eye wants that.

1276
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
The eye sees that.

1277
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The eye sees that.

1278
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And it's the same,

1279
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
like the same,

1280
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
the suit I was talking about yesterday,

1281
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
when the weather asked the man,

1282
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
what do you think,

1283
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
which is more numerous,

1284
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
things that you haven't seen

1285
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
or things that you've seen.

1286
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Things that you haven't seen, obviously.

1287
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
You use, because of that,

1288
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
you abandon all the things that you've seen.

1289
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
All the things that you will see

1290
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
with always be less numerous

1291
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
the things that are unseen.

1292
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Thus, but reflecting on that,

1293
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
unseen, we can abandon

1294
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
everything that you've seen

1295
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and you will see.

1296
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
In the same sense,

1297
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
which is more numerous?

1298
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Beautiful or ugly?

1299
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Ugly.

1300
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Out of 100 people,

1301
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
you might find one or five attractive.

1302
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yet,

1303
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
there of the same material,

1304
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
of the same make,

1305
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
like 95 unattractive ones,

1306
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
old, sick, aging,

1307
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
overweights,

1308
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
whatever,

1309
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
things you don't find attractive,

1310
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
they're more numerous

1311
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
than the ones you pick as attractive.

1312
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So you realize

1313
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
how circumstantial attractive this is,

1314
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and how random,

1315
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
and how exactly,

1316
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
nothing to do with you.

1317
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's entirely your eye,

1318
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
finding this circumstantially pleasing.

1319
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But you just run with it,

1320
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
why because it pulls you?

1321
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Because you don't know any better.

1322
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And that's it.

1323
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So that's why

1324
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
a protrusion that can free himself from sensuality.

1325
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Obviously,

1326
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
there will be a lot of wisdom.

1327
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It's quite unlikely

1328
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
that a protrusion of free from sensuality

1329
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
that has come across

1330
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Buddha's teaching

1331
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
wouldn't discern enough

1332
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
to get the right view either.

1333
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Like, it's unlikely.

1334
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Because it's kind of along

1335
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
the same way of abandoning assumptions.

1336
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But it is possible,

1337
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
technically,

1338
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
seeing they've never had

1339
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
a protrusion,

1340
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
it's possible, why?

1341
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Because those things are obvious.

1342
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Well, not obvious.

1343
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Sorry, those things can be discerned,

1344
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
can be made obvious.

1345
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That is what's insured it is.

1346
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's pain.

1347
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And by going with it,

1348
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
you avoid the pain of the yank

1349
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
or the pull.

1350
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Well, especially,

1351
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
imagine if you're a weak little man,

1352
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
have a massive

1353
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
rot-weather,

1354
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
or even some crossbreed,

1355
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and bull-master,

1356
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
powerful dog.

1357
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Oh, you better go with it.

1358
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Because it will rip your arm out.

1359
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But when you go with it?

1360
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Well, exactly.

1361
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Go with it means

1362
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
you're going to end up

1363
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
in the places you don't want to be.

1364
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah.

1365
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Inevitably.

1366
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You'll be dragged over things

1367
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
just so you get a final satisfaction

1368
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
while the animal wants.

1369
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But 95% of it,

1370
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
you'll be dragged over thorns

1371
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and bushes and sharp rocks

1372
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and whatever else.

1373
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You have to put up with

1374
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
just so you get that last moment of

1375
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
life.

1376
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Oh, okay, I go with it.

1377
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And then another one.

1378
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And then another one.

1379
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And then another one.

1380
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So it's much better actually

1381
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
to start developing your arms

1382
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
so you can overpower the animal

1383
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
rather than animal overpowering you.

1384
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It will take time,

1385
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
but there's any other strength

1386
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
development will,

1387
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
physical and mental.

1388
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah.

1389
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Everything takes time,

1390
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
but it's worth it.

1391
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And in this case,

1392
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
obviously,

1393
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
pretending to the mind,

1394
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
it's, well,

1395
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
the benefits are immeasurable.

1396
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
There's that,

1397
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
one translation

1398
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
in the 60-year fighter.

1399
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I don't know what to say about this,

1400
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
but it's his guide.

1401
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Not guiding the doors,

1402
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
well, guiding the doors of the

1403
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
senses is quite good in there.

1404
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
We said guiding the aperture

1405
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
of the senses,

1406
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
apertures.

1407
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I don't know.

1408
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It sounded quite nice,

1409
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
because...

1410
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
What was that?

1411
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
A sutra.

1412
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, a sutra in the fighter.

1413
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Someone just translated

1414
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
guiding the apertures

1415
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
of the senses,

1416
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
which just seems a bit more...

1417
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I don't know.

1418
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Because you can get that sense

1419
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
or that sense of that door

1420
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
of the senses.

1421
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah.

1422
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
That's all you're doing.

1423
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You're not trying to,

1424
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
you're trying to be pulled into,

1425
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
into this.

1426
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah.

1427
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That sense of that door.

1428
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So it's not,

1429
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
it's not like...

1430
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
You can't just go 24-7

1431
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
saying no,

1432
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
go everything.

1433
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It's just going to collapse.

1434
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You can't,

1435
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
you can't sustain that.

1436
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So you discern

1437
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
when a dog is about to pull you,

1438
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
when a wild animal of the senses

1439
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
is about to pull you.

1440
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
What direction is heading?

1441
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Olsum or an Olsum?

1442
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Olsum?

1443
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Fine.

1444
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Go.

1445
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Don't go too fast.

1446
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Don't let it yank you.

1447
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So, be mindful in other words.

1448
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Okay, you have to eat.

1449
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
The animal of the taste

1450
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
will inevitably enjoy it,

1451
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
but you also have to eat.

1452
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So,

1453
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
you do let the animal go and eat.

1454
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
But you're mindful of it,

1455
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
so make sure

1456
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
it's not about enjoyment.

1457
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's about eating.

1458
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But you don't go,

1459
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
you don't have to go

1460
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
for the wild music parties.

1461
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Or, you know,

1462
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
even worse,

1463
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
take drugs

1464
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
or immoral sexual behavior

1465
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
or who knows what else.

1466
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You don't have to do that.

1467
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So,

1468
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
you don't let the animal go there.

1469
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
If animal is used to going there,

1470
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
which every animal is,

1471
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
it will hurt saying no to that animal,

1472
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
because it will keep yanking you.

1473
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
You're yanking you.

1474
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You're yanking you.

1475
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
But you do as well.

1476
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It can't yank me forever.

1477
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
But if I do give in,

1478
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
well,

1479
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
it will end up yanking me for much longer.

1480
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And,

1481
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
you have 95% of pain

1482
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
revolving around it.

1483
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Being dragged out of your control.

1484
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And then you come up with a counter.

1485
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Once you, you know,

1486
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
when you think yanks you,

1487
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
if you stand your ground still,

1488
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
you can withstand.

1489
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But if you give in,

1490
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
when the animal picks up more pace,

1491
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
more speed,

1492
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
then it's much harder to stop.

1493
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Then you just have to wait for the crash

1494
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and hope to survive the crash,

1495
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
and then restart again.

1496
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Oh, painful elephant,

1497
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
like so many similes in the suit.

1498
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Power is there,

1499
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
a pain,

1500
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
in full control.

1501
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So,

1502
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
this is in regard to yourself,

1503
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
your own senses,

1504
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
which means,

1505
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
like, you know,

1506
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
teaching an animal,

1507
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
a dog,

1508
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
training it,

1509
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
training to listen to your voice.

1510
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Well,

1511
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
it's identical.

1512
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
You have to train yourself

1513
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
to listen to your voice,

1514
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
the voice of reason,

1515
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
of wisdom,

1516
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
of discernment.

1517
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Because, you know,

1518
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
people know,

1519
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
deep down,

1520
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
you know,

1521
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
whether you're just giving in,

1522
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
or whether you're going about it.

1523
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
As soon as you look,

1524
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
you know.

1525
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
That's right.

1526
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Because you know,

1527
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
you feel guilty,

1528
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
and that's where I need to come up

1529
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
with those excuses

1530
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
that, that time,

1531
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
you just listed the people

1532
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
who will often say,

1533
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
ah,

1534
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
it's a real great deal.

1535
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
This is the real challenge.

1536
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
There's no nonsense.

1537
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You do that only just to cover up

1538
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
your sense of guilt

1539
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and response really.

1540
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You know deep down inside,

1541
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
what are you doing,

1542
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
whether you're doing what it's,

1543
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
whether it's indulgent or not.

1544
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But it's awesome, right?

1545
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Awesome.

1546
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
You just have to listen.

1547
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Learn how to listen to that.

1548
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Or rather,

1549
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
you have to make that voice powerful

1550
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
to override the pull of the senses.

1551
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So when that voice says no,

1552
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
there is absolutely no debate.

1553
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The animals stay still.

1554
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And it's far from impossible.

1555
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
This takes a method.

1556
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But everything takes effort.

1557
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Being yanked by an animal

1558
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
takes effort,

1559
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
it's indulgence.

1560
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Putting up with things.

1561
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And that's much worse

1562
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
because you're not in control at all.

1563
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So sometimes it can take you down a way

1564
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that ends up fatal,

1565
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
or much worse than what you anticipate

1566
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
as people often do.

1567
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And that's based on sensuality.

1568
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
But saying no,

1569
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
and investing in training,

1570
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
your mind to be stronger

1571
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
than the senses,

1572
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
is like,

1573
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
well,

1574
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
there's nothing dangerous about that.

1575
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
All on the contrary.

1576
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Thus,

1577
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
even if you spend your entire life

1578
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
for the rest of your life in tears

1579
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
and pain of restraint,

1580
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
it's still more awesome

1581
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and more peaceful actually

1582
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
than being driven around

1583
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
by the fine wild animals.

1584
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Did you know?

1585
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You can teach them how to enjoy other things.

1586
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Well, that's the thing.

1587
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
When they're prevented

1588
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
from going wild

1589
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
as far as they can,

1590
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
then they started joining what they have.

1591
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
What you give them.

1592
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Yes, sir.

1593
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
That's how I work.

1594
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And that's actually,

1595
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
there is another suit

1596
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
where the Buddha says that

1597
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
to a venerable ameluda,

1598
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
just practice janas,

1599
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
which is like the ultimate

1600
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
establishments of your mind,

1601
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
the strength,

1602
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
which is developed.

1603
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Why?

1604
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Because if you develop janas,

1605
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
then the course

1606
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
rice that you're eating

1607
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
will feel like the finest

1608
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
hand-picked rice grains

1609
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
from, you know,

1610
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
the most,

1611
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
the richest caries.

1612
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So the course rice

1613
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
would feel the finest.

1614
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Why?

1615
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Because that's what you gave your mind.

1616
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And that's where your mind

1617
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
got established.

1618
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And now it finds

1619
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
tremendous contentment.

1620
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And that's it.

1621
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Contentment comes from the mind.

1622
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It doesn't come from

1623
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
the prey that your animals chase

1624
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
and hunt.

1625
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You prevent that.

1626
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Then they'll have to settle

1627
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
with what they have.

1628
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And when they do,

1629
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
then you have even more.

1630
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Then he said,

1631
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
practice janas

1632
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
because they,

1633
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
the course hand probes

1634
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
that you wear

1635
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
will feel

1636
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
will be perceived

1637
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
as finest

1638
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Kashmir silk.

1639
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Practice janas

1640
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
because sleeping

1641
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
on the root of

1642
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
three or cage

1643
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
like this where we are now

1644
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
will feel like

1645
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
spending time

1646
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
in the fully-plasted

1647
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
mentions,

1648
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
King's palaces.

1649
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Why?

1650
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Because the mind

1651
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
determines

1652
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
how it's going to feel

1653
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
like.

1654
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Undeveloped mind

1655
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
will need more

1656
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
to get any sense

1657
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
of gratification,

1658
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
fully-developed mind

1659
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
warning any

1660
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
essential

1661
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
to get sense of

1662
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
content and gratification.

1663
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Which people work

1664
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
for their whole lives.

1665
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
They give you

1666
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
all life,

1667
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
sleeping, you know.

1668
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Having a boss

1669
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
whom you hate

1670
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
who is abusing you

1671
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
to make you do things

1672
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
you don't want,

1673
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
colleagues you don't trust.

1674
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And you just have

1675
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
your friends.

1676
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Well, like,

1677
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
keep a living with your family

1678
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
that you don't get on with.

1679
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
They,

1680
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that's human life.

1681
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You spend your whole life

1682
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
why?

1683
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
For that

1684
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
five percent of the

1685
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
that they find

1686
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
like itch,

1687
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
just rickering the

1688
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
itch open,

1689
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
bleeding out.

1690
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But having

1691
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
a little sense of

1692
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
gratification of

1693
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
scratching it,

1694
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
to scratch,

1695
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
just a bit.

1696
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Ignoring 95% of the

1697
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
mess you're creating

1698
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
just because they're

1699
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
tiny little scratch.

1700
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And then,

1701
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
compared that to the pleasure

1702
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
of somebody

1703
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
whose itchy wounds

1704
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
have healed completely

1705
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
and it feels

1706
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
nowhere to whatsoever

1707
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
at all

1708
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
ever again.

1709
00:55:42,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You can't even compare it.

1710
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Are you right about

1711
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
that?

1712
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah.

1713
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I mean, I was thinking

1714
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
the other day too,

1715
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and when I'm meeting

1716
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
these British bulls

1717
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
and like,

1718
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
this

1719
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
brown rice and all of that,

1720
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I'm enjoying it

1721
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
far much better than

1722
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
anything I used to have.

1723
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
In the earlier times,

1724
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I went to

1725
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
the...

1726
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Well, you can see that.

1727
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Like, you can see it.

1728
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You know,

1729
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
when you have a plate full

1730
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
of a table full of different

1731
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
plates of food,

1732
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and you just, you know,

1733
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
go for the ones

1734
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
really you like,

1735
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and the mind gets overly

1736
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
excited all the way.

1737
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You kind of get

1738
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
some enjoyment,

1739
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
but it's not

1740
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
the same as if like,

1741
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
when you're like this

1742
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
in the middle of the jungle,

1743
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
no village inside,

1744
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
nothing,

1745
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and then you have some

1746
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
plain food,

1747
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
but that's all you have.

1748
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It feels much

1749
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
more gratifying

1750
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and satisfying

1751
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
than when you have a full

1752
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
plate full table of

1753
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
all sorts of plates and stuff.

1754
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
When you're just so concerned

1755
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
about picking the word

1756
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
exactly what you want,

1757
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
if you don't end up

1758
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
really

1759
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
appreciating anything.

1760
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It will, if you

1761
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
if you only eat

1762
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
when you're hungry,

1763
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I mean,

1764
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
whatever you eat.

1765
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Exactly.

1766
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
If you only eat

1767
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
when you're hungry,

1768
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
whatever you eat,

1769
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
you'll enjoy it.

1770
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Yeah, if you can drink it.

1771
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Like, if you just try

1772
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
to fast drink

1773
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
two days.

1774
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Then,

1775
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
then like, you know,

1776
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
the plainest

1777
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
cream crack is

1778
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
well, you know,

1779
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
when you haven't

1780
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
been eating for days.

1781
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So it's just like

1782
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
how far your animals

1783
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
have proliferated.

1784
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
How far they

1785
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
you got used to going.

1786
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
As I say, you have a

1787
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
wild dog.

1788
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
He's just used to

1789
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
running around

1790
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
wherever he wants.

1791
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
But you can't expect him

1792
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
to be content

1793
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
sitting in one spot.

1794
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
He won't.

1795
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
He will be

1796
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
angry,

1797
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
mad.

1798
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But he will come down.

1799
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Training.

1800
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
That's why

1801
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
the suit is off to

1802
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
about training.

1803
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Training yourself.

1804
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
They're becoming

1805
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
a master of your sense of

1806
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
him.

1807
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And it's not

1808
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
which we need to be

1809
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
then you become a

1810
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
master of your life.

1811
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Well, then wisdom is

1812
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
easy.

1813
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You're not being

1814
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
distracted,

1815
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
pulled around,

1816
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
controlled by your

1817
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
senses.

1818
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Insight is just

1819
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
the matter of time.

1820
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So,

1821
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
you're not

1822
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
being distracted,

1823
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
pulled around,

1824
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
controlled by

1825
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
your senses.

1826
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Insight is just

1827
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
the matter of time.

1828
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah.

1829
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You start to see

1830
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
way more things.

1831
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Is it obvious?

1832
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Then you need

1833
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
very little instruction.

1834
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,000
You don't need a

1835
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
PhD or a degree of

1836
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
listening.

1837
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
A job.

1838
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Work yourself up.

1839
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Get out.

1840
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Because you've got

1841
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
your senses already.

1842
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Well, the senses

1843
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
got you.

1844
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Changing it

1845
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
around.

1846
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So,

1847
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
you're not

1848
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
being distracted.

1849
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
You're not being

1850
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
distracted.

1851
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,000
You're not being

1852
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
distracted.

1853
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You're not being

1854
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
distracted.

1855
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You're not being

1856
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
distracted.

1857
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
You're not being

1858
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
distracted.

1859
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So,

1860
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
you're not being

1861
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
distracted.

1862
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
You're not being

1863
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
distracted.

1864
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You're not being

1865
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
distracted.

1866
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,000
You're not being

1867
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
distracted.

1868
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Well, yeah.

1869
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
All the

1870
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
pursuits were

1871
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
the ambitious stuff

1872
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
comes through the

1873
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
senses.

1874
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Through wanting more

1875
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
for your senses.

1876
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
You know,

1877
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
later on security,

1878
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
safety,

1879
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
all of that comes

1880
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
comes through

1881
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
being controlled

1882
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
by the senses.

1883
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Living on that

1884
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
domain,

1885
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
where those

1886
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
animals control

1887
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,000
you and

1888
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
pull you around,

1889
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
pull you apart

1890
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,500
as they please.

1891
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:57,500
So, sometimes people

1892
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:03,300
it, some restraint, just don't run out just now, wait, because then you can run further

1893
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,740
later, but it still pertains to the same round, same yank, same pull by the same animal

1894
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:15,300
with the same chain. So you really want to start addressing the nature of being pulled

1895
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:21,820
by your senses. In other words, you really want to start addressing the unwholesome pull

1896
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:37,740
and then controlling the wholesome ones. And you address that then it becomes apparent

1897
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:45,060
that it was never you who was going after sights. It couldn't have been you because sights

1898
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:52,260
pertain to your eyes. That's why it's called Salayatuna, 6th sense space. Then you have

1899
01:00:52,260 --> 01:01:02,940
the 5 senses and in the sutras they refer to as fields, which means these fields are

1900
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:11,460
where these sights run and pertain to, which means your eyes goes after the sights. By

1901
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:18,460
being constantly pulled, you just stop, you don't even see that. All you see is me and

1902
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:22,500
the stuff around sights around. So you end up appropriating, you end up thinking you

1903
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:28,220
are those animals. But you start distinguishing yourself, there is no sight without this

1904
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:36,740
fleshy organ of my eyes, inconceivable to have sights, to see sights, even eyes. Same for

1905
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:43,940
any other of the 5 senses, inconceivable without the corresponding sense. So if you think

1906
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:49,980
inconceivable without which means it's inseparable from, it's fully determined by, it's fully

1907
01:01:49,980 --> 01:02:03,140
bound by, it's fully made by that, which means you and your senses self is completely redundant.

1908
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:09,580
And that can be discerned even when you are not free from sensuality. But imagine how

1909
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:14,620
easy that would be to discern when you are not being driven around by those animals.

1910
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:19,300
Then you just see, hey, I have no interest in this at all and now I have proven that to

1911
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:24,940
myself, I have confirmed it to myself, better world than proven, I have confirmed for myself

1912
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:29,540
that I have no interest in it because I am in control, not the animals. And all you see

1913
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:34,140
is just pathetic animals trying to run left and right. And then even they will come down

1914
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:42,180
eventually. And then it becomes apparent, yeah, this was not mine to begin with. Because

1915
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:49,180
if it were yours, you would have say in it, if it were yours, those eyes would not be

1916
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:54,980
subject to destruction, subject to sickness, subject to death. You wouldn't, but they are,

1917
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,900
which means it's all yours. You can't have it both.
