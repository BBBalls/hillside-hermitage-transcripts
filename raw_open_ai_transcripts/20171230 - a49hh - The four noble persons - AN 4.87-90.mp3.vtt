WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.480
I thought just to ask some thanks which I find the suitors relating to stages of Ayyapugala

00:11.480 --> 00:18.240
and also inside elements like eight emaciations.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.040
So I will read it later on.

00:21.040 --> 00:27.840
So I'm referring to the suitors and we'll turn on the Kaya 4 suitors which are suitors

00:27.840 --> 00:36.920
by the 7 to 90 and that's in those suitors who are talking about 4 kinds of persons found

00:36.920 --> 00:46.240
existing in the world and he categorized those 4 people, those 4 persons, one is the ascetic

00:46.240 --> 00:55.560
and shaken, second is the white lotus ascetic, third one the red lotus ascetic and the fourth

00:55.560 --> 01:01.240
one the delicate ascetic among ascetics, so basically it's just referring to Sotapana

01:01.240 --> 01:10.840
Sakadagami and Arhat and each suitah describes this Ayyapugala's side differently and I put

01:10.840 --> 01:22.120
them together so I will just read some qualities of Sotapana which I think we'll be quite

01:22.120 --> 01:25.000
familiar with it.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.480
Here we are at a distraction of three letters, a big with a string enterer, who divers

01:31.480 --> 01:39.840
aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage, he's one of right view and this

01:39.840 --> 01:46.000
means that he's the one of the right people know about and who has not attained his

01:46.000 --> 01:49.480
mind's ideal.

01:49.480 --> 01:56.000
So I'll just take this take here, my god I'm interested actually what is the mind's ideal

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
in this suitah?

01:57.000 --> 02:04.800
Well, for Sotapana is to be an Arhat and to be completely free from suffering, so he's

02:04.800 --> 02:16.080
not quite there yet, but this whole quality is not referred to later one for Sakadagami

02:16.080 --> 02:17.080
maybe.

02:17.080 --> 02:29.240
And to pass security from bondage, be an Arhat, okay here I don't have any particular

02:29.240 --> 02:36.640
question for Sotapana, so second thing is, he's Sakadagami, he says here with the other

02:36.640 --> 02:43.640
distraction of three letters and with diminishing of great hatred and illusion, I'll be

02:43.640 --> 02:50.360
quick one, one's returner, who after coming back to this world only one more time will

02:50.360 --> 02:53.080
make an end of suffering.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.520
Here with a distraction of the tense, a vehicle has realized for himself direct knowledge

02:57.520 --> 03:03.560
in this very light the tenteless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom and having

03:03.560 --> 03:09.520
enter upon it, he dwells in it yet he does not dwell having contacted with the body

03:09.520 --> 03:12.360
the eight emancipations.

03:12.360 --> 03:22.200
He has actually not just a right view, right intention and other right qualities, even

03:22.200 --> 03:27.040
over past, but also right knowledge and the right liberation.

03:27.040 --> 03:35.080
This is Sakadagami, and he dwells contemplating the rising and vanishing of the five aggregates

03:35.080 --> 03:38.480
subject to assumption.

03:38.480 --> 03:45.040
So this is really kind of different described Sotapana, obviously the most interesting one

03:45.040 --> 03:50.040
was if he has also right knowledge and right liberation.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.920
It's those two are the ones that Arhatagami develops, which is why he becomes perfect,

03:54.920 --> 03:59.720
which is why he becomes fully light in Arhatagami, it was the right knowledge and right liberation.

03:59.720 --> 04:04.360
There were other suitors and that's mentioned, but those two are basically, he has them,

04:04.360 --> 04:10.240
I think he has a notion of them, basically think of Sakadagami as Sotapana, who has applied

04:10.240 --> 04:14.160
himself more than just the Sotapana.

04:14.160 --> 04:19.600
So then he starts gaining the more of that knowledge, more of that liberation, so it becomes

04:19.600 --> 04:27.240
almost like a discernible phenomena, discernible factor, but only an Arhat is fully developed

04:27.240 --> 04:35.840
as, which is why he is an Arhatagami, so what is, what we mean by knowledge and right liberation?

04:35.840 --> 04:43.520
Basically means just the continuation of the Noble-Afford path means that if those

04:43.520 --> 04:51.160
that develop then he doesn't have to keep doing it anymore, he becomes it, because for

04:51.160 --> 04:58.600
Sotapana, well, for all the areas, the Noble-Afford path they need to keep applying it, keep

04:58.600 --> 05:04.400
sort of sticking to it, keep finding energy for it, keep resisting distraction against

05:04.400 --> 05:09.200
it, even that's plot of fulfillment, then just the right knowledge and the right liberation

05:09.200 --> 05:13.640
is a result of it.

05:13.640 --> 05:19.680
And would be directly like for Sakadagami, or for this kind of person, create distinction,

05:19.680 --> 05:25.840
or I'm not over Sotapana, I'm Sakadagami, because Sotapana is Sakadagami, but it keeps

05:25.840 --> 05:26.840
since then.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.440
Yeah, I don't think there would be.

05:28.440 --> 05:32.040
I think it depends on the faculties of Sakadagami.

05:32.040 --> 05:38.320
He might be, well, if he's faculties of Shapa, he might see that there are more perceivable

05:38.320 --> 05:45.960
difference between when he was a Sotapana, and then after he is sort of weakened the

05:45.960 --> 05:53.080
other factor of sensuality in your world, but it's not, it's just a gradual weakening.

05:53.080 --> 05:57.520
Like, so he can look back and say, yeah, I'm stronger than when I had the right view, but

05:57.520 --> 05:58.840
like, how much stronger?

05:58.840 --> 06:06.080
Well, I am not free from sensuality, which means then I might be at the most Sakadagami.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.520
If you were to be free from sensuality, then you're okay, so I'm, so, but see, if the

06:09.520 --> 06:16.440
Buddha never laid out these four kind of constants, these four kind of guidelines, milestones,

06:16.440 --> 06:22.160
now, cornerstone, milestones, you, they wouldn't have known, all they would have known is,

06:22.160 --> 06:27.360
yeah, I've understood the Dhamma, yeah, my, my last version I've been kind of lessened

06:27.360 --> 06:31.440
because of the Dhamma, or, oh, yeah, I don't have any more last nora version because

06:31.440 --> 06:35.720
of the Dhamma, or, oh, my mind is completely bright and pure free from suffering and supreme

06:35.720 --> 06:39.840
security of bondage, but they wouldn't have called it in those terms.

06:39.840 --> 06:45.440
The Buddha laid it out only after, like, a constant kind of being harassed by, by questions

06:45.440 --> 06:48.600
or where it is such, in such a month or even more, and where it is, because people wanted

06:48.600 --> 06:52.560
to know how far they were in their practice, and then they would say, well, it's, it's

06:52.560 --> 06:53.560
a real hassle.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.200
If every time somebody dies, you come and talk to me and ask me about him, so, and he laid

06:57.200 --> 07:02.600
down these critters, so it's just like a, kind of a general sort of criteria of the

07:02.600 --> 07:06.120
state, and then, you know, because there is, I don't know if you include it, but there's

07:06.120 --> 07:13.120
another sort about Sotapana, where basically it says, well, the common sort of description

07:13.120 --> 07:21.160
is a seven lifetimes and most, but there is one sort that says, Sotapana dies, and basically,

07:21.160 --> 07:25.160
while he's still in that experience of death, he becomes an Arhan, then I think the other

07:25.160 --> 07:32.240
one is while he's in between, kind of, because he becomes an Arhan, or while he's getting

07:32.240 --> 07:37.320
ready to be reborn or something, and he becomes an Arhan, or he becomes an Arhan upon landing

07:37.320 --> 07:39.240
or upon being reborn.

07:39.240 --> 07:44.600
So you realize, yeah, it's at most, so again, you give a general description, they will

07:44.600 --> 07:49.640
include everybody who would be a Sotapana, but it doesn't mean the Sotapana has to go

07:49.640 --> 07:50.640
through seven.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.640
No, it just depends.

07:51.640 --> 07:58.680
How much he has applied himself, how much, how much of these uppertilers are here sort

07:58.680 --> 08:04.080
of abolished or weakened, and then, and how clear his knowledge is.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.120
How much effort he has invested in the repetition of that knowledge.

08:07.120 --> 08:12.760
So then, moment of death might be enough for Sotapana, and quite often probably would be,

08:12.760 --> 08:19.360
as it was mentioned in the Sotas, that, oh, yeah, that is the complete dispassion, release

08:19.360 --> 08:24.320
and so on, when they're dying, basically, when they have no more room for any distraction

08:24.320 --> 08:28.640
or carelessness or complacency.

08:28.640 --> 08:32.800
But if that doesn't happen yet, what they would have told us then, well, they won't

08:32.800 --> 08:37.400
be reborn shortly enough human, and it would be at most several lifetimes, not more than

08:37.400 --> 08:38.400
that.

08:38.400 --> 08:43.040
And you understand this lifetimes more than the traditional way, basically, die and

08:43.040 --> 08:44.040
then you will.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.040
Well, yeah, but not necessarily as a human.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.480
So you might be higher.

08:49.480 --> 08:54.040
Well, basically, seven more returns.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.680
Seven more reappearances, re-emergence at most.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.080
Well, it can be two and a half.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.480
I was thinking that maybe seven, seven, number seven is more metaphorical, because sometimes

09:03.480 --> 09:08.880
number just means like, I don't know, there are 500 are, and this means exactly 500 means

09:08.880 --> 09:09.880
like just a lot.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.880
It means seven is few.

09:10.880 --> 09:11.880
You, maybe?

09:11.880 --> 09:12.880
Yeah.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.240
Well, actually, yes, probably.

09:16.240 --> 09:20.520
Because as you read, like, and even when it comes to anagams, like, ah, not written,

09:20.520 --> 09:21.520
he's going to be incurable.

09:21.520 --> 09:26.440
But then you read that, I think it's an anagami signita, they're like all these different

09:26.440 --> 09:30.360
types of heavens, like, I don't know, with search or something, based on the different

09:30.360 --> 09:34.680
fact, how strong the anagami's were in their understanding.

09:34.680 --> 09:40.640
So it's basically just like one gradual development, then the Buddha laid out milestones for just

09:40.640 --> 09:47.320
as an incentive, as a as a guideline, as a kind of clarification, as a sort of a place

09:47.320 --> 09:51.680
of confidence as well, because you can, you can all, you understood.

09:51.680 --> 09:56.720
Like, if you have, before the Buddha described what Sotapana is, the actual Sotapana is what

09:56.720 --> 10:00.200
they've understood the Dharma, and be free from three fetters, they wouldn't have necessarily

10:00.200 --> 10:06.400
known, almost certainly they wouldn't have known that they cannot be reborn, lower than

10:06.400 --> 10:11.800
a human, that they cannot be reborn more than seven times, they wouldn't have known

10:11.800 --> 10:12.800
that.

10:12.800 --> 10:17.240
But, but saying by defining is like, oh, yeah, so then they, they do feel the release and

10:17.240 --> 10:23.640
kind of a sense of, a sense of freedom and accomplishment, and that's quite important

10:23.640 --> 10:25.640
as well.

10:25.640 --> 10:31.680
And also, in a similar manner, by defining what Sotapana is, in terms of which practice

10:31.680 --> 10:35.320
you're free from, what Sotapana can do, what Sotapana can do, what Sotapana can do, what

10:35.320 --> 10:40.280
the Buddha is intentions is similar things, and you didn't, so does then actually it clarifies

10:40.280 --> 10:46.280
you what you need to understand, so you actually kind of defines the work, defines the object

10:46.280 --> 10:53.040
for your contemplation, because if you do understand, you would be the one, it's just, that's

10:53.040 --> 10:54.040
how it works.

10:54.040 --> 10:59.680
So, there is no look in between, no, I understand, but I'm not Sotapana, nope, you can't have

10:59.680 --> 11:00.680
that.

11:00.680 --> 11:05.000
So, you either understand, in which case you're Sotapana, so I understand, if I'm not Sotapana,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.880
no, I'm not means I don't understand, because that's the only way of thinking that can

11:09.880 --> 11:15.320
actually then keep you coding, coding you on towards understanding the Sotapana, if there

11:15.320 --> 11:20.960
is anything in between that compromise will obstruct, so if you are able to hold a contradiction

11:20.960 --> 11:25.840
of yes I know, and at the same time know that you, the one who doesn't know, well that's

11:25.840 --> 11:29.640
massive contradiction of a very fundamental, essentially coding, somebody can tolerate

11:29.640 --> 11:34.880
that, means they cannot become Sotapana, because of that, so it has to be black and white,

11:34.880 --> 11:40.040
and be like, oh you know, well that's, yeah, it's harsh, but what do you want, you want

11:40.040 --> 11:43.520
harsh, what do you want easy, that can kind of keep you put to dinner or harsh, that can

11:43.520 --> 11:47.880
sort of make a Sotapana, and it's so hard, it's harsh only because you're sensitive,

11:47.880 --> 11:53.320
so basically if a person thinks I've only a Sotapana, nobody short in a Sotapana understands

11:53.320 --> 11:59.200
the Dhamma, means that any notion of them understanding the Dhamma unless they're Sotapana,

11:59.200 --> 12:03.880
they will not take for granted, which means they will eventually understand what Dhamma

12:03.880 --> 12:08.160
is, but if they take it, if they take it as that which they have understood, they won't

12:08.160 --> 12:12.040
be making a further effort to understand it, and they will take it as that which they

12:12.040 --> 12:17.600
have understood, if they are able to maintain conservation of somebody, yeah, I understood,

12:17.600 --> 12:20.800
and at the same time know that they're not Sotapana.

12:20.800 --> 12:27.200
So we may quote Sotapana doesn't have doubts anymore, but when he comes to some presidious

12:27.200 --> 12:34.280
ness Sotapana, and maybe sees, and can he say, oh I'm sorry, I don't understand that one.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.080
Yeah, yeah, probably.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.480
Like you probably mentioned, there are reservations and some other things, but yeah, yeah, because

12:40.480 --> 12:46.080
there are so many, so many different ways, well, they're all ways along the same universal

12:46.080 --> 12:50.920
principles, but they're different approaches, and they're different expositions, and different

12:50.920 --> 12:56.080
descriptions, and yeah, I mean, most of those people back in the day they haven't heard

12:56.080 --> 12:58.080
it all.

12:58.080 --> 13:01.800
So then, if they were to dwell on it, or they were to talk more about it, I'm sure they

13:01.800 --> 13:07.800
would see it within the principles, but not by default, like suddenly they know everything

13:07.800 --> 13:11.960
and everyone who ever said it, no, it doesn't work for that.

13:11.960 --> 13:18.000
So basically, the Sotapana stage would be a really recognition that all these things,

13:18.000 --> 13:25.480
this kind of, this is impossible, actually, to own five aggregates, like feeling, perception,

13:25.480 --> 13:26.480
and so on.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.480
Well, they would stop.

13:27.480 --> 13:34.840
They would basically cease to assume a separate center of experience, the center experience

13:34.840 --> 13:38.560
that is basically independent of the five aggregates, it's independent of anything that appears

13:38.560 --> 13:44.400
for it, which is the Atavada, they cannot think that anymore, and by not being able to

13:44.400 --> 13:48.160
think that anymore, all they would see is five aggregates arising, five aggregates ceasing.

13:48.160 --> 13:53.040
So basically, all these aggregates would more feel like in longs more there, rather than

13:53.040 --> 13:55.280
actually something that belongs to me.

13:55.280 --> 14:02.280
Well, yes, but see, yeah, describing that would imply a comparison between hard feels without

14:02.280 --> 14:05.160
atavada and hard feels without atavada.

14:05.160 --> 14:11.280
Now, the Sotapana would feel released shortly after abolishing atavada, but then that

14:11.280 --> 14:12.280
is the normal state.

14:12.280 --> 14:17.600
So here's no old reference anymore to compare to this, which means that's it now.

14:17.600 --> 14:22.280
It was very beginning, it didn't belong to him, so no, no, no, no, what I mean is he

14:22.280 --> 14:27.600
doesn't have the old reference of atavada to compare to the new reference of all the things

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
don't belong to me.

14:28.600 --> 14:34.120
There's a memory of it, but any kind of emotional release there will be initially upon understanding

14:34.120 --> 14:38.680
until things settle, but in afterwards he cannot go back and kind of have the experience

14:38.680 --> 14:43.240
of atavada and then compare it to the experience of the non atavada, which is what you compare

14:43.240 --> 14:48.400
basically when you said like, oh, there in terms of how much release there is no, because

14:48.400 --> 14:51.800
I would require him to still be able to access atavada, he can still access atavada

14:51.800 --> 14:53.600
you're not free from it.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
You have an abolished it.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.600
He doesn't need much of remembering his argument mindless and care.

14:59.600 --> 15:04.200
Yeah, because the right view is what his center experience is now.

15:04.200 --> 15:10.080
So all he has to do really is not actively distract himself from that, because if he stops

15:10.080 --> 15:14.760
distracting automatically the mind will go back to what is based on, and for so the

15:14.760 --> 15:19.080
premise, based upon the right view, for putugina is based upon atavada.

15:19.080 --> 15:26.280
So basically it's like he cannot anymore control, he doesn't he realizes in the first place

15:26.280 --> 15:31.880
he was not as he could control in the feeling, the perception and the whole nature.

15:31.880 --> 15:35.880
Yeah, there was no separate identity of self apart from those things.

15:35.880 --> 15:41.720
So if he still remains, if he's still affected by those things to some degree, which is

15:41.720 --> 15:48.840
what one would be, he would be just a degree that he still might kind of regard it as

15:48.840 --> 15:53.400
for me, my mind, in relation to me, but not in relation to that independent sense of

15:53.400 --> 15:59.520
self as a view, as like this, that just cannot, cannot rise.

15:59.520 --> 16:04.240
So yeah, he couldn't possibly take things in such a permanent manner, even if he were

16:04.240 --> 16:07.360
to make the effort to do so, he would be inconceivable for him.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.200
So there's still a memory in this kind of longing, this kind of distance.

16:10.200 --> 16:15.880
And the reason why he would be inconceivable for him is because things were truly impossible

16:15.880 --> 16:24.280
to begin with, and that's why 100 is possible, by finding that out, you have then basically

16:24.280 --> 16:29.480
undone the mistake of not knowing that he was impossible, which means what you have

16:29.480 --> 16:33.080
to do that mistake, you can't really go back to it, even if you think about it, it just

16:33.080 --> 16:36.080
doesn't, that it can't, it's inconceivable, it cannot happen.

16:36.080 --> 16:41.720
And because if you didn't know before, you had a visa, that's why you were understanding

16:41.720 --> 16:46.600
that now, this is why it was all the time, this kind of longing, basically kind of frustration

16:46.600 --> 16:51.640
for Tanka, praying maybe to Gros for me, so I feel like, you know, I think the other

16:51.640 --> 16:58.440
way around actually, I mean longing is more longing, like leaning forwards, like, for

16:58.440 --> 17:03.480
it, you know, it's important for me, perception for me, it just kind of just very subtle,

17:03.480 --> 17:11.160
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so you can kind of realize that, but then it's still time that

17:11.160 --> 17:18.720
this old comma diminishes, basically still kind of effect, maybe a habit, can quite

17:18.720 --> 17:20.720
have it, so the one still has a habit.

17:20.720 --> 17:27.080
Well, he still has a habit, but he still also has a sense of I am, in terms of conceit,

17:27.080 --> 17:35.680
yeah, so, yeah, it's not as much as for Petudjana, who is like fully self-centred in a completely

17:35.680 --> 17:41.120
assumed gratuitous center of art of art, but still, so only for an artist, you can truly

17:41.120 --> 17:46.120
say that all he has left are the habits, so the one still has a good three-quarters of

17:46.120 --> 17:52.040
responsibility for his habits, especially if you don't have habits of last version

17:52.040 --> 17:56.240
of evolution, and it's impossible, but you're really not habits then, and it's impossible

17:56.240 --> 18:02.840
if he doesn't take this possibility for his sexuality, he can't ignore it, or he can

18:02.840 --> 18:11.240
ignore it on the art of certain extent, because all he has to do is stop, to take a break

18:11.240 --> 18:16.160
from all the destruction and unholes some habits, and at that time he will be looking at

18:16.160 --> 18:21.680
his right view, from his right view, he just, that is his place of rest, so all he has

18:21.680 --> 18:27.520
to do is not, not distract himself, not sort of get careless in the sense of take, and

18:27.520 --> 18:32.800
then it would, at most, in seven lifetimes, basically, in any way, but he wants to fast

18:32.800 --> 18:35.000
all he needs to do is practice his strength, basically.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.600
It's like, well, all that has to be done, not to put the stick back to the water, that's

18:39.600 --> 18:40.600
all.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
Yeah, yeah.

18:41.600 --> 18:51.600
There's things which are really rare in Saka Pekami, it says, if I read it again, here

18:51.600 --> 18:55.800
with destruction of things, the Biko has realized what himself direct knowledge, in this

18:55.800 --> 19:00.760
way alive, the dangerous liberation of mine, the liberation of wisdom, and having thanks

19:00.760 --> 19:05.280
upon it, he trusts in it.

19:05.280 --> 19:11.960
This is listed in Saka Pekami, does it mean this thing, so does it, doesn't have, why

19:11.960 --> 19:29.040
it's just, I don't know if it's anything, no, it sounds bad, I don't see, this is not

19:29.040 --> 19:30.040
Saka Pekami.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
I didn't make any mistake.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.040
If you didn't enter, the eight minutes patience comes later on.

19:32.040 --> 19:36.440
No, it says, here with the destruction of the three fighters, the diminishing of greed

19:36.440 --> 19:41.840
is in delusion because once you turn it, who after coming back to this world, who after

19:41.840 --> 19:45.640
coming back to this world, one more time, will make an end to suffering.

19:45.640 --> 19:49.560
And in the next paragraph that you say, here with the destruction of the ten, the Biko

19:49.560 --> 19:53.160
has realized for himself direct knowledge, in this very life, the tenest liberation

19:53.160 --> 19:57.960
of mine, liberation of wisdom, having entered upon it, he does it, he does not dwell, having

19:57.960 --> 20:01.280
connected with the body, the eight emancipations.

20:01.280 --> 20:05.800
So oh, I see, the last bit is different, okay, he dwells in it, he does not, I thought

20:05.800 --> 20:08.800
just everything in the first sense, and that's our answer.

20:08.800 --> 20:17.040
But even that, I think, well, I guess, no, this can be also said basically for a sotapana.

20:17.040 --> 20:24.120
Because sotapana knows what nibana is, and he can enter upon it with wisdom, liberation

20:24.120 --> 20:26.160
by wisdom, and he can be dwell in it.

20:26.160 --> 20:32.160
But for as long as his body, the phenomenon of the body, I must say, like body into some

20:32.160 --> 20:33.160
mystical experience.

20:33.160 --> 20:38.320
But for as long as that body does not get established in it, he won't be in nibana

20:38.320 --> 20:39.320
as an other hand.

20:39.320 --> 20:44.720
But it is the same nibana, it is the same understanding, in that sense, yeah, even sotapana

20:44.720 --> 20:50.080
has the notion of the right knowledge and right liberation, but it's very weak notion.

20:50.080 --> 20:54.480
And as I said, the only other hand is fully developed it.

20:54.480 --> 21:01.080
So basically, the difference between sotapana and sotapana is basically that, like you

21:01.080 --> 21:06.320
said, sotapana is just more developed, sotapana, and one of the differences between

21:06.320 --> 21:09.720
sotapana and sotapana has also the right knowledge and right liberation.

21:09.720 --> 21:10.720
Okay.

21:10.720 --> 21:16.080
And then it says, it was contemplating rising and seizing, the fact that it is a Dritra

21:16.080 --> 21:20.400
assumption, that's also sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana.

21:20.400 --> 21:25.960
And then, amagami, here, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, the biku is one

21:25.960 --> 21:36.080
of continuous births, due to attained by nibana, without returning from that world.

21:36.080 --> 21:44.800
And also, the births have been concentrated with the body, the eight emancipations, and

21:44.800 --> 21:55.600
the same body, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana,

21:55.600 --> 21:56.600
sotapana.

21:56.600 --> 22:10.960
And then, as for the very, very fine type of reborn sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana.

22:10.960 --> 22:16.480
So to that degree of residue, to that degree of almost, is going to have very well in one

22:16.480 --> 22:24.040
of the purebotes, but even then, they told you that sanitamika, just dozens of them.

22:24.040 --> 22:29.800
like one place for all noises, depending how much residue you have left, and you can measure,

22:29.800 --> 22:35.000
even the voodoo can measure that, it's so subtle, because he said he will obtain the final

22:35.000 --> 22:41.160
variation here now, oh, if there is an any residue left, he will go to the pierabot and then be

22:41.160 --> 22:51.160
finished there, so, and that's why often Anagami's would have overestimated himself and thinking

22:51.160 --> 22:55.640
there were other ants, but they couldn't tell, the voodoo would only be able to tell what I

22:55.640 --> 23:02.600
see in the mind, but which means Anagami, that's already person free from sensuality,

23:02.600 --> 23:08.600
aversion, virtually free from all the ignorance, he still couldn't tell, because he's just so,

23:08.600 --> 23:13.160
so subtle left over, but it doesn't matter, if it's that subtle it doesn't matter,

23:13.160 --> 23:16.520
because they're going to have a spontaneous rebirth in such a refined realm,

23:16.520 --> 23:24.440
preserved only for such beings, and he'll be going up, but very soon upon landing again,

23:25.080 --> 23:30.120
might be longer, might be a bit much more longer, and another one just here, just imagine.

23:30.760 --> 23:36.040
I think there's some sort of some variations, yes, you know, it could be quite,

23:36.040 --> 23:40.360
you're ready to jump from sort of the part of the Arabian ship, but what prevents

23:40.360 --> 23:47.400
him to go to all to the Arabian ship, and he remains to be Anagami, is he's delighted and done well.

23:48.120 --> 23:52.280
Right, just kind of step there, I think I'm holding on the last thing.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.240
Yeah, yeah, no, I remember that, yeah.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.480
It's just not the link from you.

23:59.480 --> 23:59.720
Yeah.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.240
Maybe it could be a little bit excited.

24:03.240 --> 24:12.360
It's not that small, you're just not looking back thoroughly at the right view that brought

24:12.360 --> 24:17.240
into that place, and not just because even that, even at the right view, you just completely

24:17.240 --> 24:22.040
developed this passion towards, discussed this passion, relinquishment, everything else,

24:22.040 --> 24:24.600
and then you're fully enlightened, and it's really just extinguished.

24:25.160 --> 24:30.600
So they might not necessarily do that sufficiently, they might not necessarily experience

24:30.600 --> 24:32.920
complete need be that towards the right view then.

24:37.400 --> 24:42.760
And the most interesting things is he dwells hadn't contacted.

24:42.760 --> 24:46.280
Contacted with a body, the eight emancipations?

24:46.280 --> 24:51.960
Yeah, you should have gone to the eight emancipations.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.480
Yeah, what is the body world?

24:53.480 --> 24:55.080
What is the translation emancipation?

24:55.080 --> 25:03.720
Art of immolca, okay, like liberation, okay, yes, shall I just read first?

25:03.720 --> 25:08.120
Well, yes, sure, and then one processing Europa, Ciceropa.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.200
Why not preceding the Europa internalists, Ciceropa externally?

25:13.160 --> 25:16.520
One is released upon the idea of the beautiful,

25:16.520 --> 25:19.720
or translation can be one is focused on and beautiful.

25:19.720 --> 25:28.680
So, fourth one is through the complete surmounting of perception of Europa,

25:28.680 --> 25:37.160
the passing away of perception of impingement and content and non-attention

25:37.160 --> 25:41.720
to perception of diversity, perceiving in brackets.

25:41.720 --> 25:48.920
Space is infinite, one enters and dwells in the base of infinity of space.

25:48.920 --> 25:53.160
This fifth one is the same thing, consciousness is infinite,

25:53.160 --> 25:57.640
six, there's nothing, seven, need a perception, non-attention,

25:57.640 --> 26:00.440
eight, Ciceropa perception.

26:00.440 --> 26:06.120
So, just first four really interesting things.

26:06.120 --> 26:10.840
Well, the point is, you know, like, I mean, they are eight different,

26:10.840 --> 26:16.360
but not eight different in a sense of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

26:16.360 --> 26:20.520
But it's basically one within that, you can go to the second one,

26:20.520 --> 26:24.120
within that, you can go to the third one, within that, you can go to the fourth one.

26:24.120 --> 26:27.400
So, if you have one, definitely you conducted all of them.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.480
But how far, up that one, you will go.

26:32.680 --> 26:37.000
That's basically how to find, in terms of development, your mind gets.

26:37.880 --> 26:41.640
So, does every, every area, Puglara, say, a lot to do all these things?

26:41.640 --> 26:45.080
No, not every Anogami and Arhant.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.360
Not all.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.640
No, that's the thing.

26:47.640 --> 26:55.080
So, they contact those principles of such a liberation,

26:56.120 --> 26:58.760
which means they get one, the first one.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.480
One is the Ciceropa.

27:01.480 --> 27:02.680
Oh, Ciceropa, yeah.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.040
So, start with that.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.640
Within that, they can, you know, is they're beyond,

27:07.640 --> 27:09.800
as sometimes you're reading the service,

27:09.800 --> 27:13.480
and then go further, in further, in further, until they go what?

27:13.480 --> 27:15.160
The ultimate, and there is no beyond.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.560
And it was a similar description when he came to Janas,

27:17.560 --> 27:21.000
and that's a Sariputra in Magi Manika, one by one,

27:21.640 --> 27:24.520
steps whenever, when he comes to the session of session.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.680
He says, there is no beyond this, that's it.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.440
So, basically, Anogami, sort of an Arhant,

27:30.440 --> 27:33.320
Sakarigami, have not contacted with the body,

27:33.320 --> 27:36.120
the principle of such, the liberation of two of these things.

27:36.120 --> 27:36.520
Huh?

27:36.520 --> 27:37.960
The understanding is phenomenal.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.240
Well, I think that, because even, even those,

27:41.240 --> 27:44.920
those are probably along the same lines that say,

27:44.920 --> 27:46.840
A. Sotabana would have developed his mind.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.880
So, he would have, he would have started

27:49.880 --> 27:51.880
to get in the principle of the mind development,

27:53.320 --> 27:56.760
which means that he hasn't contacted with the body,

27:56.760 --> 28:00.600
which means he hasn't really experienced those liberations.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.160
So, but if he, if he experienced,

28:03.160 --> 28:04.680
well, a contact with the body means basically,

28:04.680 --> 28:07.720
making, making such experience actual present,

28:07.720 --> 28:09.720
not just resolve upon wisdom,

28:09.720 --> 28:12.040
you can, you can clear it up with wisdom,

28:12.040 --> 28:14.680
but actually, you haven't been establishing your mind

28:14.680 --> 28:17.960
in the sense that, now, that experience is what is present

28:17.960 --> 28:19.640
for you, actually, right there and then.

28:19.640 --> 28:20.760
So, going to the body, wouldn't we,

28:20.760 --> 28:22.280
let it take some mystical strength?

28:22.280 --> 28:23.240
No, no, no, no, no, no.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.720
Contacting with the body just means making it actual,

28:25.720 --> 28:28.920
as opposed to, like, a peripheral understanding.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.440
And it can be very, that's how, like,

28:31.400 --> 28:33.560
people can resolve upon wisdom,

28:34.440 --> 28:37.080
upon the element of Nibana, and become an Arhant.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.520
Doesn't mean the resolve is put to, now,

28:38.520 --> 28:40.120
you need to have the element of Nibana,

28:40.120 --> 28:41.720
you need to understand what it is.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.400
And then, if the mind gets resolve upon it,

28:43.400 --> 28:45.800
it will drag the body into the actual experience of it,

28:45.800 --> 28:47.400
if the mind doesn't come up.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.480
So, that's where the pain of emotive,

28:49.480 --> 28:51.000
like, liberate through wisdom.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.280
Basically, he, he kind of shoots his mind out there,

28:54.280 --> 28:55.640
towards the right principle that he isn't

28:55.640 --> 28:57.480
understood through the clarity of his wisdom,

28:57.480 --> 28:59.080
but he's actually quite far removed

28:59.080 --> 29:01.880
in terms of actually experiencing

29:01.880 --> 29:04.680
as an actual reason phenomenon that Nibana

29:04.680 --> 29:06.360
are attaching him in the body.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.800
But if he mind stays in it,

29:07.800 --> 29:09.960
the body will eventually catch up with it,

29:09.960 --> 29:12.360
and then he would say, yeah, he was liberated.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.040
All you have, those whose mind is developed,

29:14.040 --> 29:15.400
they're not necessarily understanding

29:15.400 --> 29:17.480
all the, all the subtleties of Nibana,

29:17.480 --> 29:19.320
but they clearly have the mind developed

29:19.320 --> 29:21.400
to the extent of, yeah, they're actually experiencing

29:21.400 --> 29:24.600
that with the body, that kind of the undetermined element,

29:24.600 --> 29:26.200
and they can, they, they're experiencing,

29:26.200 --> 29:27.800
they can hold onto it, they can have it.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.200
Present, as opposed to, you know,

29:30.200 --> 29:31.640
it's not like a momentary song.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.240
So, that's like when people are sort of liberated,

29:35.240 --> 29:35.880
both ways.

29:35.880 --> 29:40.200
And, and in this case, basically, it's that.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.720
So, these eight, just think of it as one,

29:45.240 --> 29:47.560
and think of that one as standing as a description

29:47.560 --> 29:48.600
of touching the body.

29:50.440 --> 29:50.920
That's it.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.040
So, within that, you can keep refining that

29:54.040 --> 29:56.360
to the point of cessation and perception and feeling,

29:56.360 --> 29:57.240
but you don't have to.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.200
You can become a fool in life in Narahana,

30:00.200 --> 30:01.480
just by touching the principle.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.560
So, just by getting the first one.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.840
So, how important is it now to understand this sutra?

30:07.480 --> 30:08.360
What sutra?

30:08.360 --> 30:10.360
Well, that sutra just gives you the ultimate

30:10.360 --> 30:13.000
perfect scenario of going through all the eight.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.920
Like, in the same sense, whenever Janas go,

30:14.920 --> 30:16.360
they go through all four.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.600
Then, whenever the material sort of establishments

30:18.600 --> 30:21.320
of mind are described, again, they're all described.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.960
But, there are all the sutras that we've said,

30:23.960 --> 30:25.800
it's the strength of the first Janas,

30:25.800 --> 30:27.240
enough for our own children.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.920
Anagami needs to understand the first Jan,

30:28.920 --> 30:30.360
and he can become fully enlightened,

30:30.360 --> 30:33.880
or a hand. So, you might not have necessarily touched with the body,

30:33.880 --> 30:38.040
the seven, and the eight, of those liberations,

30:38.040 --> 30:40.520
but he certainly touched them all in a sense,

30:40.520 --> 30:43.160
that the principle, which is kind of the first one,

30:43.160 --> 30:44.520
the second one, and so on,

30:44.520 --> 30:46.600
has been understood and has been touched with the body.

30:47.960 --> 30:52.120
We've got one by one, at least, first four.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.800
So, one possessing urukatsu is rupa.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.760
This ice is almost just...

31:00.760 --> 31:04.760
Well, see, this can be a long discussion,

31:08.040 --> 31:10.200
because it's a sort of thing.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.080
So, basically, if I were to sort of describe the emboleads to you,

31:14.200 --> 31:20.840
then we have to sort of address the meaning of those words as well,

31:20.840 --> 31:23.400
and then I might have to do the meaning of those words as well.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.520
So, most concisely, basically,

31:26.520 --> 31:28.360
the experience consists of two points of view,

31:28.360 --> 31:29.480
simultaneously present.

31:31.320 --> 31:35.240
One coming from the direction of the conscious body present in the world,

31:35.240 --> 31:38.600
and another one coming from the point of view of, basically,

31:41.480 --> 31:42.120
nama rupa.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.520
So, the two points of view at once,

31:47.320 --> 31:49.480
which is why reflection is possible,

31:49.480 --> 31:52.600
which is why our energy is possible, really,

31:52.600 --> 31:55.080
because if there is only one point of view to your experience,

31:55.080 --> 31:58.520
right there and then, there would be a sense of self.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.560
There would be a center.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.920
But the reason, there's always two.

32:00.920 --> 32:01.800
They cannot be one.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.000
So, if there's always two,

32:05.000 --> 32:06.360
they cannot be one self.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.600
They cannot be one conceit.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.160
So, two points of view of one.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.600
So, imagine you've become very skilled.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.400
There was two points of view of rupa.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.480
Simultaneous, that's what five aggregates are.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.440
It's two points of view.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.400
Two things simultaneously present.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.920
Two directions, two points of view.

32:22.920 --> 32:25.320
They don't come together.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.040
They don't meet.

32:26.040 --> 32:26.760
They don't cross.

32:26.760 --> 32:27.960
There is two points of view

32:28.680 --> 32:30.120
with their respective directions.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.520
And then, because you have two points of view,

32:32.520 --> 32:36.520
you can sometimes see the same thing twice.

32:37.960 --> 32:41.720
But it doesn't mean that you see it independent of those points of view.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.440
It just means you recognize that thing is double present.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.720
Two points, it appears in both directions.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.720
And that's it.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.720
But there is no outside of those directions, by the way.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.920
So, attention cannot be resting on one point of view

32:56.920 --> 32:58.120
or the other point of view.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.320
But it's the assumption of the external in regard to the two points of view

33:01.320 --> 33:03.720
that causes the whole confusion and so on.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.720
So, imagine you've removed all the confusion.

33:05.720 --> 33:06.920
And I've just said two points of view.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.520
And, because of that,

33:08.520 --> 33:09.960
the confuses two points of view is that

33:09.960 --> 33:11.480
it doesn't see them.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.480
It doesn't see the two points of view.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.400
It's just me, basically.

33:15.400 --> 33:19.640
So, imagine you remove the confusion in regard to two points of view.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.640
And, well, the possibilities are endless.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.640
Well, not endless.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.640
They will end in this station and perception and feeling.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.640
So, with one point of view,

33:27.640 --> 33:29.640
you cannot perceive the other point of view.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.640
With the other point of view,

33:31.640 --> 33:33.640
you can perceive the other point of view.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.640
Or with the other point of view, you cannot perceive the other point of view.

33:35.640 --> 33:39.640
So, I mean, while we're pursuing a little bit internally,

33:39.640 --> 33:41.640
it's a little bit stunning.

33:41.640 --> 33:43.640
I would basically have it before.

33:43.640 --> 33:43.640
Yes, it is.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.640
It's just a principle.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.640
It's just a principle.

33:47.640 --> 33:51.640
Okay, then you can sort of move along, really.

33:51.640 --> 33:55.640
Or, to the point of, when you basically stop giving attention to either points of view.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.640
And then, that's the cessation.

33:57.640 --> 34:01.640
Well, they will pretend that the other,

34:01.640 --> 34:03.640
are the four, really.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.640
Like, in between the two points of view, so to speak.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.640
Not externally,

34:07.640 --> 34:11.640
just, basically, not based on the two points of view.

34:11.640 --> 34:15.640
Whereby, it will culminate in cessation of perception and feeling.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.640
Or the both points of view.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.640
The word beautiful,

34:19.640 --> 34:21.640
in those third lines, which is interesting,

34:21.640 --> 34:25.640
that you're beautiful or focused on in the beautiful.

34:25.640 --> 34:27.640
Well, there's another, I don't know if it's in the sense of the nonsense,

34:27.640 --> 34:29.640
and it says, he sees beautiful in ugly.

34:29.640 --> 34:31.640
Or he sees ugly in the beautiful.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.640
Ah, actually, ah, I'm comfortable to suit that.

34:33.640 --> 34:37.640
Right, well, it's, it's, it's, again, it's on the same things.

34:37.640 --> 34:41.640
Because the super limiter, it's obviously always on the basis of what is kind of,

34:41.640 --> 34:45.640
a limiter, and that limiter is always basically a suba.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.640
In the sense.

34:47.640 --> 34:49.640
Sure.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.640
Okay, go for a recording.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.640
One recipient of forms internally,

34:53.640 --> 34:55.640
cis forms externally,

34:55.640 --> 34:57.640
limited, beautiful, and ugly.

34:57.640 --> 35:01.640
One recipient of forms internally, cis forms externally,

35:01.640 --> 35:05.640
measure as beautiful or ugly.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.640
One not recipient of forms internally,

35:07.640 --> 35:11.640
cis forms externally, limited, beautiful, or ugly.

35:11.640 --> 35:17.640
One not recipient of forms internally, cis forms externally,

35:17.640 --> 35:19.640
measure as beautiful or ugly.

35:19.640 --> 35:23.640
One not recipient of forms internally, cis forms externally,

35:23.640 --> 35:25.640
blue ones,

35:25.640 --> 35:27.640
blue in color,

35:27.640 --> 35:29.640
with a blue, with a blue tint.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.640
And that goes straight to the yellow,

35:31.640 --> 35:33.640
because then it's red and it's white.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.640
So, first one is,

35:35.640 --> 35:39.640
this is like the white recipient of forms internally,

35:39.640 --> 35:41.640
cis forms externally,

35:41.640 --> 35:45.640
limited, beautiful, or ugly.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.640
So, say, basically, the money,

35:47.640 --> 35:49.640
the money really about super limiter and so on.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.640
Yeah, you can see beautiful in ugly.

35:53.640 --> 35:57.640
Oh, you can see ugly and beautiful.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.640
And basically, discerning that,

35:59.640 --> 36:01.640
that depends upon the two point of view,

36:01.640 --> 36:03.640
present at once,

36:03.640 --> 36:05.640
you would see that, well,

36:05.640 --> 36:07.640
beautiful in terms of intoxication loses its power,

36:07.640 --> 36:09.640
because you just see beautiful,

36:09.640 --> 36:13.640
that simultaneously seen as ugly.

36:13.640 --> 36:17.640
So, you could just resolve upon seeing the beautiful

36:17.640 --> 36:19.640
in everything that is really around you,

36:19.640 --> 36:21.640
which is ugly,

36:21.640 --> 36:23.640
or you could resolve to see ugly in everything that's beautiful.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.640
It doesn't matter.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.640
It doesn't matter. The point is dispassion

36:27.640 --> 36:29.640
in regard to the two.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.640
So, only when people have one point of view

36:31.640 --> 36:33.640
and what they have presented,

36:33.640 --> 36:35.640
well, when they assume one point of view,

36:35.640 --> 36:37.640
and what they have presented in front of them,

36:37.640 --> 36:39.640
is the beautiful, there's that kind of mesmerizing

36:39.640 --> 36:41.640
and lasting song with the beautiful,

36:41.640 --> 36:43.640
mind is locked up on it.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.640
You see, it's simultaneously,

36:45.640 --> 36:47.640
just simultaneously present, again,

36:47.640 --> 36:49.640
as another point of view,

36:49.640 --> 36:51.640
automatically cannot be as beautiful,

36:51.640 --> 36:53.640
which means it's ugly,

36:53.640 --> 36:55.640
for whatever reason.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.640
And then the second one is about,

36:57.640 --> 36:59.640
the first one was like,

36:59.640 --> 37:01.640
it's limited,

37:01.640 --> 37:03.640
but then becomes, measure us.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.640
Yeah, infinite.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.640
Infinite.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.640
So, finer,

37:09.640 --> 37:11.640
arises on the basis of infinity,

37:11.640 --> 37:13.640
so only because it's possible for things to be infinite,

37:13.640 --> 37:15.640
they can be finer.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.640
So, in the same sense,

37:17.640 --> 37:19.640
a finer thing, a defined thing,

37:19.640 --> 37:21.640
right in front of you,

37:21.640 --> 37:23.640
that has a reason to view your point of view,

37:23.640 --> 37:25.640
you discern the other point of view,

37:25.640 --> 37:27.640
becoming through that thing,

37:27.640 --> 37:29.640
and then you see, yeah,

37:29.640 --> 37:31.640
it's on the basis of infinity.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.640
The domain of eight point of view,

37:33.640 --> 37:35.640
one of the point of view,

37:35.640 --> 37:37.640
or the nature of the point of view,

37:37.640 --> 37:39.640
the nature of the direction is that infinity.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.640
So, you start seeing that,

37:41.640 --> 37:45.640
while the finer thing is present in front of you.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.640
So, with limitless,

37:47.640 --> 37:49.640
you see limited,

37:49.640 --> 37:51.640
or with measureless,

37:51.640 --> 37:53.640
you see limited,

37:53.640 --> 37:55.640
or with limited,

37:55.640 --> 37:57.640
just what point of view you attend to,

37:57.640 --> 38:01.640
and what aspect of the point of view you attend to.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.640
And again,

38:05.640 --> 38:07.640
the purpose of that,

38:07.640 --> 38:09.640
is the full dispassion

38:09.640 --> 38:11.640
in regards to the five other rates,

38:11.640 --> 38:13.640
the structure of the experience.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.640
So, you don't have to really say that one,

38:17.640 --> 38:19.640
if like it's least,

38:19.640 --> 38:21.640
or one to eight.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.640
No, of course,

38:23.640 --> 38:25.640
in the same sense,

38:25.640 --> 38:27.640
like the casinos,

38:27.640 --> 38:29.640
the ten casinos,

38:29.640 --> 38:31.640
you can develop a full energy upon one,

38:31.640 --> 38:33.640
upon the first one,

38:33.640 --> 38:35.640
or maybe if somebody else is on the second one,

38:35.640 --> 38:37.640
or maybe if somebody is on the third one,

38:37.640 --> 38:39.640
but not, you know, up to ten,

38:39.640 --> 38:41.640
that's it.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.640
But doesn't mean you have to go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

38:43.640 --> 38:45.640
ten, I need a service read.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.640
Sorry, eight casinos.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.640
You know,

38:49.640 --> 38:51.640
it's only four missing institutions.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.640
So, there's one, I think the ten casinos.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.640
Sorry.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.640
The four elements,

38:57.640 --> 38:59.640
the four colors,

38:59.640 --> 39:01.640
and then the space in the consciousness.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.640
But the colors is four.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.640
And then space in the consciousness.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.640
But it doesn't matter,

39:07.640 --> 39:09.640
because the first casino is already

39:09.640 --> 39:11.640
the principal casinos there.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.640
So, you're just refining the same principle

39:13.640 --> 39:15.640
that you get in the first place.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.640
So, you don't have to.

39:17.640 --> 39:19.640
Yeah, it's interesting.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.640
This is exactly the four colors,

39:21.640 --> 39:23.640
plan, what I was talking about,

39:23.640 --> 39:25.640
what's perception.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.640
The perception perceived blue, yellow, red, and white.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.640
Yeah.

39:29.640 --> 39:33.640
And there's a nice splitter.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.640
There's a verse, actually,

39:35.640 --> 39:37.640
saying, having touched with the body,

39:37.640 --> 39:39.640
the deadless element,

39:39.640 --> 39:41.640
free from clinging,

39:41.640 --> 39:43.640
having realized the linkishing

39:43.640 --> 39:45.640
of clinging,

39:45.640 --> 39:47.640
his stains are gone.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.640
The fully alighting one proclaims

39:49.640 --> 39:51.640
the sorrowless state

39:51.640 --> 39:53.640
that is void of stain.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.640
So, then with our other hands,

39:55.640 --> 39:59.640
says, here with the destruction of the tent,

39:59.640 --> 40:01.640
the vehicle has realized,

40:01.640 --> 40:03.640
for himself, with the wreck knowledge,

40:03.640 --> 40:05.640
in this very light,

40:05.640 --> 40:07.640
the tankless liberation of mine,

40:07.640 --> 40:09.640
liberation,

40:09.640 --> 40:11.640
white wisdom,

40:11.640 --> 40:13.640
and having entered on it,

40:13.640 --> 40:15.640
he dwells in it,

40:15.640 --> 40:17.640
and he also

40:17.640 --> 40:19.640
do well,

40:19.640 --> 40:21.640
and having contacted with the body,

40:21.640 --> 40:23.640
the eight manifestations.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.640
Yeah, he dwells

40:25.640 --> 40:29.640
in it, that's his actual experience, basically.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.640
That's when those, I think,

40:35.640 --> 40:37.640
thinking the notes is imagining kind of there.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.640
I didn't even disagree with some translation,

40:39.640 --> 40:41.640
kind of what it was,

40:41.640 --> 40:43.640
but he mentions that, oh,

40:43.640 --> 40:45.640
this is the kind of show,

40:45.640 --> 40:47.640
to kind of show how, like,

40:47.640 --> 40:49.640
an area,

40:49.640 --> 40:51.640
sort of fall away from the banner,

40:51.640 --> 40:53.640
and then there are problems, sort of,

40:53.640 --> 40:55.640
not falling away.

40:55.640 --> 40:59.640
There are problems not falling away from the banner,

40:59.640 --> 41:01.640
and that's when they committed suicide,

41:01.640 --> 41:03.640
things like that, because they had kind of, oh,

41:03.640 --> 41:05.640
got sick, and then they couldn't.

41:05.640 --> 41:07.640
So, yeah,

41:07.640 --> 41:09.640
it's one thing to understand the banner,

41:09.640 --> 41:11.640
to kind of develop it,

41:11.640 --> 41:13.640
to the point of that,

41:13.640 --> 41:15.640
becoming your basis,

41:15.640 --> 41:17.640
of, you know, how you replace,

41:17.640 --> 41:19.640
at a lot of the right view,

41:19.640 --> 41:21.640
well, then replace that right view,

41:21.640 --> 41:23.640
with, like, a fully, sort of,

41:23.640 --> 41:25.640
just relinquished,

41:25.640 --> 41:27.640
undetermined element.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.640
Turned in the banner.

41:29.640 --> 41:31.640
So, that takes time to develop it.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.640
That's when it's a noble effort path, kind of,

41:33.640 --> 41:35.640
eightfold, sort of, covering different aspects of it,

41:35.640 --> 41:37.640
as needed,

41:37.640 --> 41:39.640
because some people would be,

41:39.640 --> 41:41.640
because of this, some people would be falling away,

41:41.640 --> 41:43.640
because of that,

41:43.640 --> 41:45.640
and that's when some people fall away less,

41:45.640 --> 41:47.640
or fall away less far.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.640
So, you have different areas, you have,

41:49.640 --> 41:51.640
within the defined areas,

41:51.640 --> 41:53.640
you have different types.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.640
It's a really weak sort of banner,

41:55.640 --> 41:57.640
it's barely sort of a banner, it's strong sort of a banner,

41:57.640 --> 41:59.640
it's existed,

41:59.640 --> 42:01.640
because they get reborn in different places,

42:01.640 --> 42:03.640
because of the different strength.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.640
These four kinds of beings,

42:05.640 --> 42:07.640
the number ones,

42:07.640 --> 42:09.640
and they also take the skillfulives,

42:09.640 --> 42:11.640
for people maybe,

42:11.640 --> 42:13.640
grasping wrongly, and for boosting the ego.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.640
Some people go to another extreme,

42:15.640 --> 42:17.640
or you just make a political,

42:17.640 --> 42:19.640
and just be here,

42:19.640 --> 42:21.640
and don't think about these four stages.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.640
Well, yeah.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.640
Some people would say,

42:25.640 --> 42:27.640
it's just like a carer than a donkey,

42:27.640 --> 42:29.640
keeps encouraging,

42:29.640 --> 42:31.640
you know, just, like,

42:31.640 --> 42:33.640
open the stage to go to the stage.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.640
So, there's nothing wrong with that.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.640
This is actually,

42:37.640 --> 42:39.640
but I think it's better to accept them as criterias,

42:39.640 --> 42:41.640
because if you don't,

42:41.640 --> 42:43.640
then you won't be making effort.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.640
When people say,

42:45.640 --> 42:47.640
ah, don't try to become anything.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.640
Well, they would say that only because they haven't become anything.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.640
So, then they start dismissing the goal of becoming something

42:51.640 --> 42:53.640
valuable,

42:53.640 --> 42:55.640
because if it's,

42:55.640 --> 42:57.640
no, it becomes a sort of a banner,

42:57.640 --> 42:59.640
because that is what you're supposed to do.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.640
So, it's good enough to become a sucker again.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.640
Of course.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.640
It's good to say that.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.640
Well, somebody here is all such and such and such and such and such,

43:07.640 --> 43:09.640
such a banner.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.640
Well, I can do it then,

43:11.640 --> 43:11.640
because of that craving,

43:11.640 --> 43:13.640
he actually makes the effort and does it.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.640
But if the one who hears about somebody

43:15.640 --> 43:17.640
becomes sort of a banner or somebody coming out of hand

43:17.640 --> 43:19.640
says, oh, there is nothing to become anyway,

43:19.640 --> 43:21.640
you can know for sure he won't be making an effort.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.640
That's just how it works.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.640
Why would he be making an effort when he dismissed the goal?

43:25.640 --> 43:27.640
He dismissed the name.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.640
So, that's why the Buddha was encouraging such aim,

43:29.640 --> 43:31.640
so that you can crave for it,

43:31.640 --> 43:33.640
because of which you would abandon the craving

43:33.640 --> 43:35.640
and then actually become one sort of a banner.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.640
So, only people have got anywhere in the book,

43:37.640 --> 43:39.640
who didn't get anywhere in the practice,

43:39.640 --> 43:41.640
would be dismissing it,

43:41.640 --> 43:43.640
who would say, they would say things like,

43:43.640 --> 43:45.640
oh, there's nothing to be able to try to become anything,

43:45.640 --> 43:47.640
there's just nothing to be becoming,

43:47.640 --> 43:49.640
or they would say things like,

43:49.640 --> 43:51.640
the more you practice, the less you know,

43:51.640 --> 43:53.640
and I've been 30 years in robes and, you know,

43:53.640 --> 43:55.640
I feel like I know even less,

43:55.640 --> 43:57.640
as if that's a good thing,

43:57.640 --> 43:59.640
should be embarrassed to say that.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.640
That's how you're wasting.

44:01.640 --> 44:03.640
Means you actually should be more embarrassed.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.640
Imagine there is something you need to learn,

44:05.640 --> 44:07.640
something you need to get fixed,

44:07.640 --> 44:09.640
and you fix it on a second day,

44:09.640 --> 44:11.640
and then you meet somebody who can't fix it for 10 years.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.640
You would say, it's pretty, pretty cold,

44:13.640 --> 44:15.640
isn't it?

44:15.640 --> 44:17.640
And you wouldn't take advice from him, wouldn't you?

44:17.640 --> 44:19.640
Would you take advice from somebody who fixed it in two days?

44:19.640 --> 44:21.640
Or for somebody who couldn't fix it in 10 years?

44:21.640 --> 44:23.640
Would you take advice on how to fix it?

44:23.640 --> 44:25.640
Who would you choose from?

44:25.640 --> 44:27.640
Ha!

44:27.640 --> 44:29.640
Simply just people indulging their own weakness.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.640
So see, they haven't got anywhere,

44:31.640 --> 44:33.640
not because they like faculties,

44:33.640 --> 44:35.640
not because they like support,

44:35.640 --> 44:37.640
not because they like health,

44:37.640 --> 44:39.640
because they like determination,

44:39.640 --> 44:41.640
they like faith,

44:41.640 --> 44:43.640
they like clarity,

44:43.640 --> 44:45.640
they like to fight enlightenment factors.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.640
And then they indulge in,

44:47.640 --> 44:49.640
then they make that to be the goal,

44:49.640 --> 44:51.640
like not getting anywhere,

44:51.640 --> 44:53.640
is the goal of the practice.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.640
Certainly it's not a goal of the Buddhist practice.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.640
Because if they were,

44:57.640 --> 44:59.640
he would have said so.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.640
He would have not said entirely the opposite thing.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.640
Ha!

45:03.640 --> 45:05.640
So...

45:05.640 --> 45:07.640
As soon as the monks,

45:07.640 --> 45:09.640
they were quite,

45:09.640 --> 45:11.640
not quite clear maybe,

45:11.640 --> 45:13.640
but there was some knowledge

45:13.640 --> 45:15.640
who attained what,

45:15.640 --> 45:17.640
maybe things were spoken up.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.640
But now this goal is to know if she is spoken.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.640
Yes, there's nothing there.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.640
And they just hope that other people will assume

45:23.640 --> 45:25.640
what they're hopeful,

45:25.640 --> 45:27.640
but the only reason they don't speak about attainment

45:27.640 --> 45:29.640
is because they don't know what they are.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.640
If they don't know what they will be speaking about it,

45:31.640 --> 45:33.640
because that's just along the lines of Dhamma.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.640
So, should we actually

45:35.640 --> 45:37.640
the book question?

45:37.640 --> 45:39.640
Of course not about this thing.

45:39.640 --> 45:41.640
Yeah, you should be careful.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.640
You should be careful in terms of,

45:43.640 --> 45:45.640
some people in the past have used it

45:45.640 --> 45:47.640
and used it to gain the offerings and so on.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.640
But, no, of course it should not be.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.640
I mean, it's a personal thing.

45:51.640 --> 45:53.640
And then they won't tell you,

45:53.640 --> 45:55.640
because you're just asking casually,

45:55.640 --> 45:57.640
and that's not a casual thing.

45:57.640 --> 45:59.640
But, no, of course it's not, you know.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.640
Well, like if you were to book,

46:01.640 --> 46:03.640
the book wouldn't have spoken about it.

46:03.640 --> 46:07.640
Also, for the environment of practice,

46:07.640 --> 46:09.640
so the panel basically can practice

46:09.640 --> 46:13.640
for attainment of the environment.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.640
It can be in the family,

46:15.640 --> 46:17.640
it can be in the workspace,

46:17.640 --> 46:19.640
not anymore.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.640
So, theoretically, yes.

46:21.640 --> 46:23.640
But, in the Buddhist time,

46:23.640 --> 46:25.640
because in those days,

46:25.640 --> 46:27.640
the world hasn't been proliferated

46:27.640 --> 46:29.640
as much as it is today.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.640
The availability of destruction,

46:31.640 --> 46:33.640
the freedom from fear,

46:33.640 --> 46:35.640
anxiety, sickness,

46:35.640 --> 46:37.640
aging deference,

46:37.640 --> 46:39.640
you were all kind of sheltered from it.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.640
It's all quickly covered, it's all quickly fixed.

46:41.640 --> 46:43.640
It's all quickly sort of painted over.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.640
Plus all the destruction,

46:45.640 --> 46:49.640
the majority, many fold,

46:49.640 --> 46:51.640
ways of getting it,

46:51.640 --> 46:53.640
as absolutely.

46:53.640 --> 46:55.640
So, we require the effort to step back

46:55.640 --> 46:57.640
from the pool of the world and society.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.640
Too much effort.

46:59.640 --> 47:01.640
You have a lot of effort.

47:01.640 --> 47:03.640
We require too much effort for today's person.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.640
Back in the day,

47:05.640 --> 47:07.640
when the world did not have as much pool

47:07.640 --> 47:09.640
in terms of its proliferation,

47:09.640 --> 47:11.640
in terms of its diversification,

47:11.640 --> 47:13.640
then, yeah, they could have.

47:13.640 --> 47:15.640
For those who wanted to send down

47:15.640 --> 47:15.640
or had asked me,

47:15.640 --> 47:17.640
Nirvana, what's the duration to do?

47:17.640 --> 47:19.640
Well, they lived the world.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.640
They had to leave the laylife.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.640
You can't be a layman, and expect it to.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.640
It was hard back.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.640
In the Buddhist day, they would say,

47:27.640 --> 47:29.640
oh, laylife is crowded and dusty,

47:29.640 --> 47:31.640
and we have so much to do,

47:31.640 --> 47:33.640
and so many responsibilities we can't practice down there.

47:33.640 --> 47:35.640
Imagine today.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.640
Imagine today.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.640
It's just a mess of clutter.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.640
It's absolutely not possible.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.640
It's just a mess of clutter.

47:43.640 --> 47:45.640
Sure, it doesn't need to put the role.

47:45.640 --> 47:47.640
Like, there's nothing special with the ropes.

47:47.640 --> 47:49.640
It's just an external statement.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.640
But what a layperson needs to do is

47:51.640 --> 47:53.640
justically change their living environment.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.640
Ah, not leave as a common layperson.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.640
And today,

47:57.640 --> 47:59.640
in pretty much practically speaking,

47:59.640 --> 48:01.640
the way to change that environment

48:01.640 --> 48:03.640
is to find a forest monastery.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.640
If you can do it by as a layman,

48:05.640 --> 48:07.640
going, yeah, sure,

48:07.640 --> 48:09.640
you can, and it is possible.

48:09.640 --> 48:13.640
But, yeah, I think it's important to

48:13.640 --> 48:15.640
recognize the back in the Buddhist day

48:15.640 --> 48:17.640
was hard as a layperson.

48:17.640 --> 48:19.640
20,000 years later,

48:19.640 --> 48:21.640
it's virtually impossible.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.640
And the effort doesn't mean

48:23.640 --> 48:25.640
that they have to sit like many hours meditation.

48:25.640 --> 48:26.640
Yeah.

48:26.640 --> 48:27.640
They try to read a sutra

48:27.640 --> 48:28.640
and try to understand,

48:28.640 --> 48:29.640
at least, the position,

48:29.640 --> 48:30.640
and everything.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.640
The effort means they have to sit for many hours,

48:32.640 --> 48:34.640
trying to understand the meaning of done.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.640
Many hours.

48:36.640 --> 48:39.640
Many days, many times.

48:39.640 --> 48:41.640
But if they actually spend the time sitting

48:41.640 --> 48:43.640
doing a meditation technique,

48:43.640 --> 48:45.640
well, they'll be better off as a generous layman.

48:45.640 --> 48:48.640
They'll be less misguided, probably.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.640
Just as a layman who doesn't try to practice done,

48:50.640 --> 48:53.640
but it's just been generous in virtues.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.640
But instead of if they sit,

48:57.640 --> 49:00.640
cross like watching the nostril observing the belly,

49:00.640 --> 49:03.640
they should sit for many hours,

49:03.640 --> 49:04.640
or walk for many hours,

49:04.640 --> 49:07.640
and keep doing the understanding of dharma.

49:07.640 --> 49:10.640
What are the factors?

49:10.640 --> 49:11.640
Understand the nature of the factors?

49:11.640 --> 49:13.640
You'll be free from them.

49:13.640 --> 49:14.640
What are the following virtues?

49:14.640 --> 49:15.640
See the following virtues?

49:15.640 --> 49:16.640
See the principle of them?

49:16.640 --> 49:18.640
You will be realizing them.

49:18.640 --> 49:20.640
But that won't happen by itself.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.640
That won't happen if you sit cross like,

49:22.640 --> 49:24.640
and watch a breath.

49:24.640 --> 49:25.640
Or do any other.

49:25.640 --> 49:27.640
So the main thing we have to learn

49:27.640 --> 49:29.640
is really how to contemplate,

49:29.640 --> 49:31.640
because people can go to another extreme,

49:31.640 --> 49:34.640
some iteration, but didn't do it in the entire thing.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.640
Yeah, of course.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.640
Yeah, when I say try to understand,

49:37.640 --> 49:39.640
I don't mean like doing scholarly work,

49:39.640 --> 49:42.640
and fixing all the declinations of Pali,

49:42.640 --> 49:44.640
all the time.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.640
I mean actually try to understand the nature of things.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.640
So you can see how,

49:49.640 --> 49:51.640
well, it sounds very vague to people.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.640
And the reason for that is because the thinking

49:53.640 --> 49:56.640
is so far removed from any form of correct thinking,

49:56.640 --> 49:58.640
and just the concept of thinking is,

49:58.640 --> 49:59.640
it seems so vague.

49:59.640 --> 50:01.640
Also, what do I think about?

50:01.640 --> 50:03.640
Give me an object, you know.

50:03.640 --> 50:06.640
An object is really subtle, that's the object.

50:06.640 --> 50:08.640
Yeah, that's what people struggle.

50:08.640 --> 50:09.640
They think like,

50:09.640 --> 50:12.640
what has to be the object of my thought then?

50:12.640 --> 50:14.640
Because they can't comprehend thinking

50:14.640 --> 50:17.640
without a clearly defined object.

50:17.640 --> 50:18.640
It's like, well,

50:18.640 --> 50:21.640
think about the nature of your sense-basis.

50:21.640 --> 50:24.640
You see how ambiguous that is for most people.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.640
The more ambiguous it is,

50:26.640 --> 50:28.640
the more far removed from it you are.

50:28.640 --> 50:31.640
But you won't fix that by

50:31.640 --> 50:34.640
sort of finding a completely different object

50:34.640 --> 50:35.640
to think about.

50:35.640 --> 50:37.640
You'll fix it by thinking about an ambiguity,

50:37.640 --> 50:38.640
trying to clarify.

50:38.640 --> 50:39.640
Ready the suitors?

50:39.640 --> 50:41.640
Get the info you can?

50:41.640 --> 50:42.640
Relate, think about it,

50:42.640 --> 50:43.640
and then if you become clear,

50:43.640 --> 50:45.640
you start discerning your experience

50:45.640 --> 50:46.640
why?

50:46.640 --> 50:48.640
Because you're making the effort to discerning.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.640
But if you don't make the effort to discerning,

50:49.640 --> 50:51.640
if you make effort to do some,

50:51.640 --> 50:52.640
I don't know, mechanical technique,

50:52.640 --> 50:55.640
or to be thinking about a particular mantra

50:55.640 --> 50:56.640
or something else,

50:56.640 --> 50:58.640
because you'll never descend the ambiguity

50:58.640 --> 50:59.640
of your senses,

50:59.640 --> 51:00.640
or of your nature of the soul,

51:00.640 --> 51:01.640
or anything of feelings,

51:01.640 --> 51:02.640
to that matter.

51:02.640 --> 51:03.640
Yeah.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.640
So it's ambiguous only because it's not clear.

51:05.640 --> 51:06.640
And it's all clear,

51:06.640 --> 51:07.640
because there's never

51:07.640 --> 51:09.640
any effort made towards clarification of it.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.640
So, and then, actually, you know,

51:11.640 --> 51:13.640
for someone who is aiming

51:13.640 --> 51:16.640
from high developments of the pana,

51:16.640 --> 51:17.640
you would say that actually

51:17.640 --> 51:19.640
complete seclusion is necessary,

51:19.640 --> 51:23.640
giving more away from distractions.

51:23.640 --> 51:26.640
For an authentic person, yes.

51:26.640 --> 51:28.640
For a person who's not running away from things,

51:28.640 --> 51:30.640
but for a person who's actively making the effort

51:30.640 --> 51:31.640
in overcoming them.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.640
You're talking about from sort of a dilemma.

51:33.640 --> 51:36.640
Oh, sorry, I'm talking about a dilemma.

51:36.640 --> 51:37.640
Sorry.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.640
Oh, yeah.

51:38.640 --> 51:40.640
Yeah, if somebody's already discerning the pana,

51:40.640 --> 51:42.640
if they want to become, yeah.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
Yeah, he has to be.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.640
Again, back in the day,

51:44.640 --> 51:46.640
it would have been maybe possible

51:46.640 --> 51:48.640
living in the outskirts,

51:48.640 --> 51:49.640
depending on the village,

51:49.640 --> 51:50.640
depending on the village,

51:50.640 --> 51:51.640
and so on,

51:51.640 --> 51:52.640
and kind of having interaction with us.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.640
But I think even back then,

51:54.640 --> 51:56.640
to put a cap sort of resorting months,

51:56.640 --> 51:57.640
there are empty hearts,

51:57.640 --> 51:58.640
there are empty roots of trees,

51:58.640 --> 51:59.640
empty forests,

51:59.640 --> 52:01.640
empty jungle, basically.

52:01.640 --> 52:02.640
You have to.

52:02.640 --> 52:05.640
So, today, imagine how much more you have to do that.

52:05.640 --> 52:07.640
Back then, you can go for a retreat like that,

52:07.640 --> 52:09.640
to the work,

52:09.640 --> 52:10.640
and then, you know,

52:10.640 --> 52:12.640
come back to a more comfortable setting.

52:12.640 --> 52:13.640
But today, I think,

52:13.640 --> 52:15.640
it's very much, much more.

52:15.640 --> 52:17.640
Is there hope for our partnership

52:17.640 --> 52:18.640
with this person?

52:18.640 --> 52:19.640
Yeah, yeah.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.640
There's hope as long as there is hope

52:20.640 --> 52:22.640
that we can be safe.
