00:00.000 --> 00:15.440
So these suitors are from the Samyutani Kaya, the connected discourses, and this is a

00:15.440 --> 00:18.600
chapter on feelings.

00:18.600 --> 00:28.640
And this suit is called should be seen, because there are these three feelings, what three

00:28.640 --> 00:34.240
pleasant feelings — painful feelings — neither painful nor pleasant feelings.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.640
Pleasant feelings — Bros. Beku's should be seen as painful.

00:37.640 --> 00:42.760
Painful feelings should be seen as a dart — neither painful nor pleasant feelings should

00:42.760 --> 00:46.360
be seen as impermanent.

00:46.360 --> 00:50.840
When Beku's ability had seen pleasant feeling as painful or painful as a dart in neither

00:50.840 --> 00:56.400
painful nor pleasant feeling as impermanent, he's called a beggar who sees rightly, he

00:56.400 --> 01:02.560
cut off craving severed the fetters by completely breaking through conceit. He has made an end to suffer.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.640
One who has seen the pleasant as painful and the painful as a dart, seen as impermanent

01:12.640 --> 01:19.200
the peaceful feeling, neither painful nor pleasant, he is a bicker who sees rightly one who fully understands

01:19.760 --> 01:26.080
feelings. Having understood feelings, he is tankless in this very life, standing in the dharma

01:26.080 --> 01:29.600
with the body's breakup, the knowledge master cannot be readied.

01:32.080 --> 01:38.720
That's what I was saying this morning, in relation to central pleasures,

01:42.880 --> 01:53.280
that seeing centrality as painful, the centre, the centre, the core of a central desire

01:53.280 --> 02:01.680
that is always regarded as pleasurable, that can't tip, that satisfaction, seeing that as painful

02:04.400 --> 02:11.440
in a sense of understanding, that pleasure to be the pain, not denying the fact that it's

02:11.440 --> 02:19.280
initially to see this pleasurable, that will free one from central cravings, and then

02:19.280 --> 02:26.160
applying the same principle onto the nature-feeling in general whereby whatever is being felt

02:26.960 --> 02:34.080
you regard as disagreeable because it was felt, and that's pretty much what this sutra says.

02:35.040 --> 02:40.800
You regard pain, sorry, you regard pleasure as pain, pain as even more as dart,

02:41.440 --> 02:47.440
and you are feeling the peaceful feeling you understand. It cannot be controlled, it cannot be

02:47.440 --> 02:56.240
owned thus, it's impermanent, it has a reason, it's impermanent, and I said that this morning,

02:56.240 --> 03:00.400
that's the difference, if you do that then basically you'll free yourself from conceded further

03:01.120 --> 03:05.520
towards our country, as opposed to if you just do the same principle, but in regard to the

03:06.080 --> 03:08.960
particular essential pleasure, it will free you from sensuality,

03:10.080 --> 03:15.280
but now you have to take that application onto the general level of the nature of feelings,

03:15.280 --> 03:19.040
whether it's being held, and they will free you from conceded, from the sense of I am.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.080
And this sutra refers to that second freeing self from conceded, the whole thing.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.760
Obviously, if it just feels out from conceded, you may free from sexuality as well.

03:31.760 --> 03:45.840
But this is right to see, and to see pleasant feeling as painful,

03:47.840 --> 03:51.440
because it is pleasant, so what is the painfulness of it?

03:52.240 --> 03:56.720
Then it's pleasant, then it's self, it's afflicting you.

03:56.720 --> 04:02.080
See, when you ask that, you expect you to find pain in relation

04:02.720 --> 04:08.080
or somewhere else from that pleasure, but okay, so it's pleasant, but what is pain in there?

04:09.360 --> 04:11.280
The pleasure, it's the pain.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.520
Nothing left to write up or down from it, it's that very pleasure that is painful,

04:18.080 --> 04:19.920
and that is not seen directly.

04:19.920 --> 04:27.040
Why is it painful? It's because it's... Well, see, the reason you ask why,

04:27.920 --> 04:32.240
is because you still don't know, you're still doubting it that it's painful,

04:32.240 --> 04:36.640
which means you're not seeing it as painful, thus you're asking why is it painful, how is it painful?

04:37.120 --> 04:39.680
But any of the answers will not make it clearer.

04:41.920 --> 04:46.720
Any of the answers will not make it, will not make you see directly.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.240
But I can give you an answer once you see directly.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.520
Well, you can give an answer once you see directly,

04:54.320 --> 04:57.520
but you have to be careful when you give an answer, because then there's a person

04:57.520 --> 05:00.240
I think they understand the answer without seeing it directly.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.480
But if you want to be accurate in describing it, it's what the sutra says.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.120
That pleasure is pain.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.040
Not knowing that, you perceive it as pleasure.

05:11.040 --> 05:21.840
Like a leper regarding burning coals as pleasurable, while they were actually always painful,

05:21.840 --> 05:27.360
or like the actual perception of it was also always very disagreeable.

05:27.360 --> 05:32.800
But you have to say to yourself, yeah, as investigating it.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.680
As investigating it, you basically first have to see that pleasure for what it is.

05:37.680 --> 05:44.080
And then, while it's simultaneously present, you have to simultaneously,

05:44.080 --> 05:49.360
while pleasure is there, you have to regard it as disagreeable, as painful, as dangerous.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.720
Another similar I was explaining to you this morning was the trap.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.840
For as long as you don't see the deadly trap hidden in it,

05:58.560 --> 06:00.960
it's meant solely for you to catch you,

06:02.080 --> 06:05.520
you will still regard aspects of that bait as agreeable.

06:05.520 --> 06:09.360
Even if sometimes you might suspect that there is a trap,

06:09.360 --> 06:12.640
the fact that you are not sure, the fact that you don't see it,

06:13.520 --> 06:17.760
it would be enough for you to still regard some aspects of that bait as agreeable,

06:17.760 --> 06:19.760
as desirable, as attractive.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.160
But if suddenly the danger becomes apparent,

06:22.160 --> 06:27.600
if you see what kind of trap it is, whereby even if you just stand and look at it,

06:27.600 --> 06:31.200
you are at the danger of being trapped, let alone if you engage with it,

06:31.200 --> 06:35.600
then you will not want anything to do with any part of it.

06:36.800 --> 06:41.920
So, before it was pleasant, that trap, because you didn't know it was a trap.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.480
But it was always a trap.

06:46.160 --> 06:50.640
Now you know it's a trap and any desire towards it, it's absolutely gone,

06:51.680 --> 06:54.160
because you know it results in a certain death.

06:54.160 --> 07:00.800
That's a surely.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.400
So rather than trying to explain to you why it is a trap,

07:05.520 --> 07:11.760
you really want to allow that phenomenon of that pleasure of that bait,

07:11.760 --> 07:18.000
whatever it is, to rise for what it is, obviously, without engaging with the priority strength present.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.200
So if thoughts arise, you have to see them for what they are,

07:21.200 --> 07:27.600
you have to let that pleasure arise and then feel that pain, that it's revealed by the restraint.

07:30.800 --> 07:36.800
When the mind stops trying to kind of run away from that pain that is revealed by the restraint,

07:36.800 --> 07:44.400
you are left with that bait in its entirety, and then the trap can become apparent.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.480
But not before your mind stops trying to avoid it,

07:48.480 --> 07:57.040
because people practice restraint, but when things do arise on the mental level, obviously,

07:57.040 --> 08:00.480
they're not engaging in unwholesome sensual activity with their body,

08:00.480 --> 08:05.360
but on mental level thoughts still might arise, and then they will be feeling them,

08:05.360 --> 08:08.080
or indulging them, they will not be understanding them.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.280
So by neither feeling or indulging them, but letting them arise for what they are,

08:13.280 --> 08:21.040
when you stop feeling that the risk of doing something unwholesome basically means your mind

08:21.040 --> 08:25.920
has developed in regard to those thoughts, it's not an immediate pressure by them,

08:25.920 --> 08:33.680
then you can actually see for what it is, and then you can see the agreeable as unpleasant.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.320
Why? Because it's a trap. The agreeable.

08:36.320 --> 08:45.120
It's obviously subtle because it involves perception,

08:45.120 --> 08:47.280
the domain of perception, the domain of feeling.

08:47.280 --> 08:51.840
You can also regard it basically, you can also regard it from a perception point of view,

08:52.640 --> 08:57.040
not from the feeling point of view. From a perception point of view, it is being

08:57.040 --> 09:07.680
that perception is perverted, so the agreeable aspect of the central perception is actually painful,

09:08.960 --> 09:10.000
that might make more sense.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.160
Literally being touched by that in that manner, it's actually painful.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.200
Because you touched. Because you touched full stop.

09:23.200 --> 09:29.280
Because you touched by the trap. Because giving in kills you.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.760
Giving in maintains you, keeps you, and matters domain.

09:34.720 --> 09:40.480
Giving in makes you be reborn for EMS and EMS, and because of that,

09:40.480 --> 09:45.440
direct result of that experience, every single misfortune that a mind can think of.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.640
Many times.

09:48.640 --> 10:03.040
Because of that sweet tip of pleasure, or because of that seemingly agreeable delightful perception.

10:04.160 --> 10:13.200
No matter how tiny or small it is, it's actually that very tiny, tiny little perception of that

10:13.200 --> 10:20.000
delightfulness, that is a pain. So you have to basically start looking at that.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.560
Because everything else is management. Explain to yourself why you shouldn't engage in

10:24.560 --> 10:27.920
sensuality and everything. Obviously, you need it in the beginning. But only to the

10:27.920 --> 10:33.040
bring you the point where you can see directly that in itself, it's actually pain.

10:34.560 --> 10:40.800
Rising of sensuality of any sense, or potentially the main of any kind, it's actually pain.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.680
It's actually piercing that.

10:46.400 --> 10:52.480
And then perception is not perverted anymore. Again, similar to the burning coil, burning

10:52.480 --> 11:00.480
coils. So that lapper is basically burning himself with those coils.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.360
And he regards that as agreeable, while it's actually always being disagreeable.

11:07.360 --> 11:13.760
But it's because of his disease, his assumptions, he never stops and thinks, hold on.

11:13.760 --> 11:19.760
Is this really agreeable? This very center of that delightful agreeable tip of the pleasure

11:19.760 --> 11:27.840
really is no. The fact that it presses you in that tiny, tiny manner that are very like to the

11:27.840 --> 11:37.200
cold. It's actually very unpleasant. It burns. Like you're touched by a rod, by a hot rod. Like you rest

11:37.200 --> 11:43.200
through, but it's fine. But that bit that it touches you, it hurts. And if it's obviously if it's

11:43.200 --> 11:50.640
like a tiny bit, you might not necessarily even feel the pain initially. It just feels like two

11:50.640 --> 11:57.920
centers, two concentrated. But nevertheless, it is pain. If you leave it, it will longer you'll see it.

11:58.640 --> 12:06.160
And that's what the restraint shows. Basically, when you start saying no, that pain starts to build

12:06.160 --> 12:12.160
up, pain of not engaging in your desire, which is actually the pain of the touch of the desire.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.560
Or the agreeable perception. Or the seemingly agreeable perception.

12:16.560 --> 12:23.920
So obviously people who never develop their mind, they will keep regarding restraint as the reason

12:23.920 --> 12:30.400
for the pain. But actually, restraint just shows you what touches you. Pain touches you. And that's

12:30.400 --> 12:37.920
why you can't not give in. Mind that's not developed, can't handle pain. So when a desire touches you

12:37.920 --> 12:47.360
and desire equals pain, when desire touches you, you need to give in, because you are too painful, too painful to not give in.

12:50.400 --> 13:02.000
So there is no pleasure. There is no pleasure. Pleasure is relatively marvellous. Yeah. Pleasure is

13:02.000 --> 13:09.680
misperception, sensual pleasure, sensual joy, sensual delight. It's all the result of a version of

13:09.680 --> 13:16.000
perception. Regarding that which is generally painful, regarding the touch of the painful as

13:16.000 --> 13:22.320
pleasant. Why? There is no reason why. That's why it's gratuitous. That's why you can free yourself from it.

13:23.840 --> 13:28.640
By seeing that actually this is a, this is a predispanable. You will automatically stop

13:28.640 --> 13:37.280
regarding it as pleasant. Does any infatuation, any desire, any loss towards it, evaporates,

13:37.280 --> 13:43.760
cannot possibly remain. You are saying to certain experience and agree with perception. Do you

13:43.760 --> 13:49.600
have to rewriting the deception? Yes, yes. I was in there this morning. Keep applying.

13:49.600 --> 13:58.240
Are you rewriting it so to speak? Yes, or rather restoring the right order, because now it's

13:58.240 --> 14:06.000
the better order order. So that's why I meant by rewriting. Repair it. But seeing it is painful, seeing it.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.520
Yes, seeing it. But you have to first allow that agreeable perception to arise for what it is.

14:12.080 --> 14:17.680
And then while that phenomenon is present, while that phenomenon is persisting, while it is changing,

14:17.680 --> 14:22.720
while it is enduring in your experience, which means you are mindful of it, simultaneously

14:22.720 --> 14:32.080
with that phenomenon, you will get that phenomenon in its entirety as painful. While pleasant as

14:32.080 --> 14:39.920
painful, while agreeable as actually disagreeable. And that is like finding the source of infection

14:39.920 --> 14:50.000
and right there, just applying the antibiotic, the medicine, as opposed to having the source of

14:50.000 --> 14:56.080
infection still covered up with that skin or whatever else, and then you're applying. And on top of that,

14:56.080 --> 15:02.720
you're applying medicine on a completely different body part. So it's not just the fine

15:02.720 --> 15:10.400
radius, but actually have to uncover it. So you have to get to that allow that sweet, delightful

15:10.400 --> 15:16.560
enticing center to appear without actually pulling in, which means the restraint, virtue,

15:16.560 --> 15:21.840
sealant needs to be well established before. That's what I said. You can't let your mind be engaging

15:21.840 --> 15:27.840
in distractions, even of non-central nature, because that remains the basis for sensuality,

15:27.840 --> 15:40.080
mental mind. So when the mind is not giving in to any distractions or any kind, then all it has

15:40.080 --> 15:47.920
is what's in front of it, which is basically feelings or sensuality. It's always not free from it,

15:48.560 --> 15:51.920
because that those thoughts are the thoughts that are becoming up, but now you haven't been

15:51.920 --> 15:58.960
running away. You haven't been obscuring them to the distraction of a different kind. And obviously

15:58.960 --> 16:03.280
you haven't been compromising the restraint. The restraint of the eye faculty, nose faculty,

16:03.280 --> 16:11.840
ear and so on, haven't been compromising sealant virtue. So basically, then that sweet

16:12.160 --> 16:19.280
sting of desire in regard to side sounds, mouth taste touches that hits you, you kind of let it

16:19.280 --> 16:24.320
hit you basically. Because that's not the problem. The problem is you then doing all some things

16:24.320 --> 16:28.800
on account of it. But now we know you want, because all the strain and non-distraction,

16:28.800 --> 16:37.200
so when it hits you, it's seen. Actually, this is pain, because you have no choice. You're a victim

16:37.200 --> 16:44.560
to it hitting you. And if the mind still has the assumptions of I was hit by the pleasure,

16:44.560 --> 16:51.840
so to speak, you start seeing, yeah, that pleasure is aggressive, that pleasure is pain,

16:51.840 --> 16:58.080
that pleasure is attack, that pleasure is a track. That is not a pleasure. A desire for pleasure.

16:58.080 --> 17:03.840
A desire for pleasure. Well, it's, it's almost, it's converging itself. It implies the desire,

17:03.840 --> 17:17.360
it implies the desire. So yeah, the pleasure is the perversion. Yeah, because it did.

17:25.360 --> 17:31.040
You all need to do a sit, sit down, having been restrained. Having been restrained, having

17:31.040 --> 17:38.240
practiced mindfulness properly, having not been engaging in all sorts of kind of

17:39.760 --> 17:46.880
mind oblivion based meditation techniques, but actually practice clarity and composure.

17:48.320 --> 17:56.560
Then when sensual thought arises, either rises in its entirety and you see for what it is.

17:56.560 --> 18:01.760
And they end up being a whole danger. They hold danger with it, but still it will have that sweet

18:01.760 --> 18:10.000
center. That it's still just that bit. It's still okay. This is all dangerous. This is all the

18:10.000 --> 18:16.400
track. You can still let yourself, but the mind still regards this pleasure. This sweet center

18:16.400 --> 18:22.960
is still the track. This will sweet delightful tip of the pleasure is still the track. It's still a

18:22.960 --> 18:27.680
bit of danger, but it's still regarded as sweet delightful. And then you start seeing that.

18:28.240 --> 18:34.560
And when you do that, you recognize sweet delightful equals pain, sweet delightful equals pain.

18:36.640 --> 18:41.440
And then you don't have to do any management because you've really approved that sting.

18:42.160 --> 18:49.040
It's, it's pushed out. It doesn't actually pierce you anymore in that sense. So the wound is closed

18:49.040 --> 18:58.320
and this thing is out of here. And like I put it says, what is pleasant here? Nothing is felt.

18:58.320 --> 19:02.720
Yeah, nothing is felt. So what is pleasant in the body and that freedom, the fact that nothing

19:02.720 --> 19:13.680
is felt is the utmost pleasure. Because you see feeling as being. And by it seems so,

19:13.680 --> 19:27.840
you're completely drawn from it. And the mind cannot turn away towards it.

19:44.240 --> 19:49.360
I think it's really hard for me to sit down and meditate usually.

19:51.840 --> 19:58.960
But when I'm sitting here, I'm listening to you. At the same time, mind goes in.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.680
Yeah, because that's what your meditation should be. I know, like,

20:04.800 --> 20:10.080
it's hard for me to sit down and meditate. I sit down and observe my breath or do something.

20:10.080 --> 20:17.840
Yeah, it's a completely wrong thing to do to begin with. What you have to do is understand what

20:17.840 --> 20:22.480
the Dharma is. Then you know how to meditate. So now you're trying to meditate. No one

20:22.480 --> 20:28.640
that you can't. It's actually good that you can't do it because you have less of wrong notions

20:28.640 --> 20:33.600
to undo later on. But while I'm listening to you, my mind gets really disturbed.

20:33.600 --> 20:37.520
Well, exactly. Because that's the whole point. Understanding establish your mind. Understanding

20:37.520 --> 20:42.240
is meditation. That's why the Buddha always talks about only about understanding. Everything

20:42.240 --> 20:49.040
culminates in understanding and wisdom. While I'm listening to you right now, I've thought of

20:49.040 --> 20:55.520
moments of pleasure sexually. Yeah, moments of pleasure. Now I'm repulsed by it, like my

20:55.520 --> 21:03.200
can physically feel repulsed by it. Because that's the reason why people don't see. The reason why

21:03.200 --> 21:09.600
people maintain the perversion of perception is because the mind is not developed in regard to it.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.680
The mind has never been steady. The mind has never been developed. The understanding has been

21:13.680 --> 21:21.040
initiated. Nothing like that. So then they just carry on. So even when you go and sit and meditate,

21:21.040 --> 21:26.640
you should do the same. Read a sutra before and then try to understand it in your own. That's

21:26.640 --> 21:33.120
what meditation is. Like really remove any notion of any technique, any body-watching, observing

21:33.120 --> 21:39.040
sensations, but not none of that. Just understanding. When you understand, then you know how to

21:39.040 --> 21:46.800
continue that as practice of clarity or practice of sanity or samadhi. It's still within the same

21:46.800 --> 21:51.760
right view. But if there's no right view, then you'll be just wasting your time just doing some

21:51.760 --> 22:00.160
other relaxation techniques, I guess. And it was the same. That's why back in the day when people

22:00.160 --> 22:05.040
would hear the dharma, the mind would come down. The mind would be focused. The mind would be in samadhi.

22:05.840 --> 22:12.080
Not by watching the nostrils, but by actually understanding what is being taught. Dispression,

22:12.080 --> 22:21.840
disenchantment, cooling down, the mind. That result in a calm mind. That's just how it works.

22:21.840 --> 22:32.880
Right now I'm really investigated on this a sensual touch. I almost feel that vomiting, right?

22:32.880 --> 22:41.280
Well, actually, yeah. Yeah, they had the suit as well. I think tell it, they would refer to that, like

22:45.280 --> 22:51.200
like you sort of, you push, what I said pushed out, but I think I read before, you kind of

22:51.200 --> 22:59.520
you vomit it out. The sting of sensuality was kind of deep inside of you. It comes out and it's

22:59.520 --> 23:04.320
done. I always like, but the way I get the signal, like when you vomit the food, you have no desire

23:04.320 --> 23:12.320
for it anymore, once you vomit it out. And that's when you see sensuality is painful, it's vomit

23:12.320 --> 23:20.160
the food. That's how much you want it. Zero. Even if you're really hungry, you will not be eating that.

23:20.160 --> 23:27.520
Because it's horrible. Because it is horrible. And let alone the fact that it's very dangerous.

23:27.520 --> 23:36.480
But the key is that as a layman as well, indulging in sensuality. You indulge and then the

23:36.480 --> 23:42.720
after effect you go, they're disgusting. That was disgusting. But that's not enough. There's no

23:42.720 --> 23:46.560
no, but you know, there is, there is something. You need to begin it, yeah, because most people don't

23:46.560 --> 23:52.400
even see it as disgusting. Because you've passed what you just did. Yeah. What you did yesterday.

23:56.400 --> 24:00.480
But then you forget it. Even like when you're eating, try thinking about sexual

24:00.480 --> 24:05.440
integrals. It's actually disgusting while you're eating. Well, when you're not hungry anymore,

24:06.160 --> 24:12.560
then the mind goes, goes towards such fantasies. But even like somebody who's not really trained

24:12.560 --> 24:18.560
or developed their mind, just think while you're eating. Then you say, oh, no, I'm going to eat.

24:20.000 --> 24:29.760
Because it's pretty horrible. And I'm like, the monkey is like the dogs. Look at that. I'm actually

24:29.760 --> 24:38.320
not horrible. But a version of perception needs to be seen directly. Like what I said,

24:38.320 --> 24:43.280
pleasure needs to be seen directly while it's present as pain. Otherwise, everything

24:43.280 --> 24:47.680
else is going to be revolving around it. And it will not be approaching that center of that

24:47.680 --> 24:53.360
state. It's just going to be managing it while remaining stung by it.

24:58.880 --> 25:04.160
Well, this is the suit that I'm going to read now. It needs to be connected with everything you

25:04.160 --> 25:11.920
would talk about. Also from the Samyutani Kaya. And it's called exploration.

25:14.080 --> 25:18.400
So that's how I heard on one occasion, the blessed one was dwelling among the kuru's.

25:18.400 --> 25:23.680
But it was a town of the kuru's name, Kamasadama. They had the blessed one dressed

25:23.680 --> 25:28.800
because that's Bikus. Venerable sir, those Bikus you've played, the blessed one said this.

25:28.800 --> 25:36.560
Do you engage in inward exploration, Bikus? When this was said, one Bikus said to the blessed one,

25:36.560 --> 25:42.960
Venerable sir, I engage in inward exploration. How do you engage in inward exploration, Bikus?

25:42.960 --> 25:48.720
And the Bikus then explained, but the way he explained it not satisfied the blessed one.

25:48.720 --> 25:55.600
Then the Venerable and under said, now is the time for this blessed one. Now is the time for this

25:55.600 --> 26:01.120
fortunate one. Let the blessed one explain inward exploration. Having heard it from the blessed one,

26:01.120 --> 26:10.000
the Bikus will remember it. Then listen and attend closely and under, I will speak. Yes,

26:10.000 --> 26:18.320
Venerable sir, the Bikus replied. The blessed one said this. Here Bikus, when engaged in inward

26:18.320 --> 26:24.640
exploration, a Bikus explores thus the many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world,

26:24.640 --> 26:31.680
headed by aging and death. What is the source of the suffering? What is its origin? From what is it

26:31.680 --> 26:41.760
born and produced? When what exists does aging and death come to be? When what does not exist? Does

26:41.760 --> 26:48.480
aging and death not come to be? As he explores, he understands thus the many diverse kinds of

26:48.480 --> 26:54.400
suffering that arise in the world, headed by aging and death. The suffering has acquisition as its

26:54.400 --> 27:02.000
source, acquisition as its origin. It is born and produced from acquisition. When there is acquisition,

27:02.000 --> 27:06.720
aging and death comes to be. When there is no acquisition, aging and death does not come to be.

27:06.720 --> 27:19.600
Well, just to point out before, this is what you said, it is important to understand that acquisition

27:20.240 --> 27:32.320
means, well, loosely owning regarding things as yours, acquiring them. But it doesn't mean that

27:32.320 --> 27:38.320
it's the things fault. So when people sometimes release, they think, oh, so I must not own anything

27:38.320 --> 27:44.720
and they start giving away and throwing stuff. Well, you might get rid of the stuff, but the

27:44.720 --> 27:49.040
acquisition as a phenomenon will still remain, which means then you will just appropriate something

27:49.040 --> 27:55.840
else. You will appropriate your status of being a beggar, or your status of not owning anything

27:55.840 --> 28:03.840
will be on value. So it's not so easy as to just give up your possessions in order to be free

28:03.840 --> 28:11.440
from acquisition. Acquisition is based on mental assumption of possibility to own things.

28:12.720 --> 28:17.520
You stop acquiring them when you realize you can't own them in the first place. It's impossible.

28:18.240 --> 28:22.800
Not fully understanding that it's impossible, but that's enough for the ownership. Even if you

28:22.800 --> 28:33.520
don't have anything practical. It continues. He also understands ageing in death,

28:33.520 --> 28:39.200
it's origin, it's cessation, and the way leading on that is in conformity with his cessation.

28:40.320 --> 28:46.000
He practices in that way and conducts himself accordingly. This is called the Bikku

28:46.000 --> 28:50.800
is practicing for the utterly complete destruction of suffering for the cessation of ageing in death.

28:50.800 --> 28:59.040
Then engaging further in inward exploration, he explores thus. What is the source of this acquisition?

28:59.040 --> 29:06.000
What is its origin? From what is born, from what is it born and produced? When what exists does

29:06.000 --> 29:12.880
acquisition come to be? When what is absent does acquisition not come to be? As he explores,

29:12.880 --> 29:20.320
he understands thus. Acquisition has craving as its source. Craving as its origin is born and

29:20.320 --> 29:26.720
produced from craving. When it's craving, acquisition comes to be. When there's no craving,

29:26.720 --> 29:33.840
acquisition does not come to be. He understands acquisition, its origin, its cessation,

29:33.840 --> 29:40.160
and the way leading on that is in conformity with its cessation. He practices in that way and

29:40.160 --> 29:45.840
conducts himself accordingly. This is called the Bikku is practicing for the utterly complete

29:45.840 --> 29:52.480
destruction of suffering for the cessation of acquisition. Then engaging further in inward

29:52.480 --> 29:59.760
exploration, he explores thus. When there's craving arises, where does it arise? When it settles

29:59.760 --> 30:08.000
down upon what does it settle? As he explores, he understands thus. Whatever in the world has a

30:08.000 --> 30:14.800
pleasant and agreeable nature, it is here that this craving arises. When it arises, it is here that

30:14.800 --> 30:21.680
it settles when it settles down. And what in the world has a pleasant and agreeable nature?

30:22.320 --> 30:28.240
The eye has a pleasant and agreeable nature in the world. It is here that this craving arises when

30:28.240 --> 30:34.240
it arises, it is here that it settles when it settles down. So to the ear and nose, the tongue,

30:34.240 --> 30:41.600
the body, and the mind have a pleasant and agreeable nature, it is here that this craving arises when

30:41.600 --> 30:46.600
when it arises, it is here, that it settles when it settles down.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.400
Because whatever ascetics and grounds in the past,

30:58.400 --> 31:02.360
regarded that in the world with the pleasant and agreeable nature

31:02.360 --> 31:07.360
as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure,

31:07.360 --> 31:11.760
they nurtured craving, in nurturing craving, they nurtured acquisition,

31:11.760 --> 31:15.320
in nurturing acquisition, they nurtured suffering.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.360
In nurturing suffering, they were not free from birth,

31:18.360 --> 31:20.640
aging in death, they were not free from sorrow,

31:20.640 --> 31:23.880
lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.240
They were not free from suffering, I see.

31:26.240 --> 31:30.360
So it's just another way, basically, of describing

31:30.360 --> 31:32.320
that but it's on by the principle,

31:32.320 --> 31:34.120
just in case people are not free.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.880
Yeah.

31:35.880 --> 31:39.800
With this, this is, presence of craving, presence of acquisition,

31:39.800 --> 31:43.120
presence of acquisition, manifold suffering in the world,

31:43.120 --> 31:45.920
manifold suffering in the world, aging in death, sorrow,

31:45.920 --> 31:49.200
lamentation, pain, belief, and despair.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.280
But the principle is the same.

31:51.280 --> 31:54.920
When what is present, this comes to be.

31:54.920 --> 31:58.280
And craving is present, acquisition comes to be.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.920
But that speakable, this association comes to be,

32:00.920 --> 32:03.640
both are actually in the present tense.

32:03.640 --> 32:09.120
So literally, when craving is present, acquisition is.

32:09.120 --> 32:12.320
When acquisition is present, manifold suffering

32:12.320 --> 32:15.000
in the world is.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.120
If it comes to be, you kind of expect

32:17.120 --> 32:19.400
certain amount of time to pass it.

32:19.400 --> 32:23.560
But no, presence of craving equals presence of acquisition,

32:23.560 --> 32:26.440
absence of craving, absence of acquisition.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.960
That's why simply by nurturing that,

32:28.960 --> 32:32.840
upon which craving depends, you nurture death

32:32.840 --> 32:38.520
and everything else, at the very other end of the same principle.

32:38.520 --> 32:44.080
As I said, with regard, if they regard the world with a pleasant,

32:44.080 --> 32:46.600
as a pleasant and renewable nature, they

32:46.600 --> 32:50.400
regard this permanent happiness as self, as healthy, as a cure.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.040
They nurture, they nurture, they nurture, they nurture.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.360
And as you don't have to go around and regard everything

32:56.360 --> 33:01.600
as horrible, despicable, all you need to do

33:01.600 --> 33:06.320
is just regard the pleasure as such when it arises.

33:06.320 --> 33:09.240
When there is no pleasure, no need for anything,

33:09.240 --> 33:13.920
no need for any application of that medicine

33:13.920 --> 33:16.640
I was talking about before.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.520
Because when it's a neutral feeling,

33:18.520 --> 33:20.720
all you need to do is understand it,

33:20.720 --> 33:24.920
not engage in indolence, not engage in distraction.

33:24.920 --> 33:48.040
Not trying to go into boredom, but in my sound when, oh,

33:48.040 --> 33:50.440
world is pain, world is a god.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.520
In a way, yes, why?

33:51.520 --> 33:54.560
Because you regard world as pleasurable.

33:54.560 --> 33:59.320
But you apply the notion of this is pain, this is pain,

33:59.320 --> 34:04.880
this is that only to that pleasure in regard to the world.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.680
And if you do so, there will be any craving in regard

34:07.680 --> 34:08.800
to the world.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.440
Absence of craving, there will be any acquisitions in the world.

34:12.440 --> 34:16.280
No acquisitions, no suffering.

34:16.280 --> 34:26.000
No suffering, that's it.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.640
So he gives a simony.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.280
Suppose because there was a bronze cup

34:31.280 --> 34:35.440
of a beverage having a fine color, a Roman taste.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.360
But it was mixed with poison.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.440
Then a man would come along, oppressed,

34:39.440 --> 34:43.160
and afflicted by the heat tied, parched, and thirsty.

34:43.160 --> 34:46.120
They would tell me, good man, this beverage in the bronze cup

34:46.120 --> 34:48.880
has a fine color, a Roman and taste.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.560
But it is mixed with poison, drink it if you wish.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.120
If you drink it, it will gratify you

34:54.120 --> 34:57.000
with its color, a Roman and taste.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.040
But by drinking it, you will meet with death

35:00.040 --> 35:02.040
or deadly suffering.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.560
Suddenly, without reflecting, he would drink the beverage.

35:05.560 --> 35:06.720
He would not reject it.

35:06.720 --> 35:10.280
And thereby, he would meet with death or deadly suffering.

35:10.280 --> 35:13.560
So you can think of the same simuline example.

35:13.560 --> 35:18.640
Imagine, I come to you, and I actually give you poison.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.280
Then I say, it tastes nice.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.640
Would you drink it?

35:22.640 --> 35:24.560
Would you drink any of it?

35:24.560 --> 35:26.720
If I tell you, it's a deadly poison, he would use it.

35:26.720 --> 35:27.920
This bottle has a poison.

35:27.920 --> 35:31.560
This is a poison, 100% poison.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.880
He has a very nice taste of poison.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.040
Would you like to drink it?

35:36.040 --> 35:36.880
Only five.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.080
Only five is there.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.520
But only if you haven't heard me, then I say it's poison.

35:40.520 --> 35:44.080
Or completely mad, basically.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.560
Which is why the Buddha did say, or put you in as a mad,

35:47.560 --> 35:50.200
to the effect, because they're bombarded,

35:50.200 --> 35:53.120
engaging in sexuality voluntarily.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.120
That is madness.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.000
Obviously, it's, you know, this is a lovely drink.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.720
Then you have to discern, it's actually a poison.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.600
But imagine if somebody comes and there's

36:07.600 --> 36:10.800
no lovely drink, it's straight, poison.

36:10.800 --> 36:14.200
That tastes lovely, like a lovely drink.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.640
But you wouldn't even consider it as a lovely drink.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.880
I drinkable.

36:17.880 --> 36:18.880
Why?

36:18.880 --> 36:19.880
Because it's a poison.

36:19.880 --> 36:20.880
Would it be worth it?

36:20.880 --> 36:21.880
It would be valuable.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.760
It would not have the significance of to be drunk,

36:24.760 --> 36:27.520
because it's a poison.

36:27.520 --> 36:31.840
When you see a cup with a nice drink, nice juice, cocktail,

36:31.840 --> 36:35.040
whatever, oh, this is a drink.

36:35.040 --> 36:38.240
I'm going to drink it, but this is a drinkable.

36:38.240 --> 36:42.280
But if you see a bottle with a scar and bones on it,

36:42.280 --> 36:44.720
that's equally probably even tastier than this drink.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.280
You still want to regard it as drinkable,

36:47.280 --> 36:50.360
because it's a poison.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.560
So that's my point here.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.120
That's how you actually start, need

36:54.120 --> 36:57.680
to start overriding that which you regard as drinkable,

36:57.680 --> 37:00.280
as consumable, as delightful, as agreeable,

37:00.280 --> 37:04.040
as pleasurable, centrality, like not even as such,

37:04.040 --> 37:05.280
because it's a poison.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.000
Because whatever ascetics and Brahmins

37:17.000 --> 37:19.640
in the past and future or present,

37:19.640 --> 37:22.840
regarded that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable

37:22.840 --> 37:26.720
nature as impermanence, as suffering, as non-self,

37:26.720 --> 37:31.200
as a disease, as fearful, they abandoned craving.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.760
In abandoning craving, they abandoned acquisition.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.520
In abandoning acquisition, they abandoned suffering.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.040
In abandoning, in abandoning suffering,

37:39.040 --> 37:41.160
they were free from birth, aging in death.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.520
They were freed from sorrow,

37:42.520 --> 37:45.640
lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.480
They were freed from suffering.

37:48.480 --> 37:52.280
Again, just period as it says there in the beginning,

37:52.280 --> 37:58.240
that which is pleasurable, they regarded as pain,

37:58.240 --> 38:02.360
as fear, as impermanence, as disease,

38:02.360 --> 38:05.000
not everything around you, because things

38:05.000 --> 38:08.320
that are neutral, things that are irrelevant in terms

38:08.320 --> 38:09.720
of sexuality, in terms of pleasure,

38:09.720 --> 38:12.200
in terms of delight, in terms of attraction,

38:12.200 --> 38:13.520
you don't have to worry about.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.640
And here's another summary.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.040
Suppose because there was a bronze cup of a beverage

38:25.040 --> 38:27.320
having a fine color aroma and taste,

38:27.320 --> 38:29.200
but it was mixed with poison.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.520
Then men come along, impressed, and afflicted

38:31.520 --> 38:34.640
by the heat, tied, etched, and thirsty.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.840
They were telling, good man, this beverage in the bronze cup

38:37.840 --> 38:40.000
has a fine color, aroma and taste,

38:40.000 --> 38:43.880
but it is mixed with poison, drink it if you wish.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.440
If you drink it, it will gratify you

38:45.440 --> 38:47.640
with its color, aroma and taste.

38:47.640 --> 38:52.200
But by drinking it, you will meet death or deadly suffering.

38:52.200 --> 38:56.240
Then the man would think, I can quench my thirst with water,

38:56.240 --> 38:59.240
way, porridge, or soup.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.120
But I should not drink that beverage,

39:01.120 --> 39:04.440
since to do so would lead to my harm and suffering

39:04.440 --> 39:05.520
for a long time.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.800
And that's exactly the point I just said.

39:07.800 --> 39:12.840
Having reflected, he would not drink that beverage,

39:12.840 --> 39:14.800
but would object it, and thereby he would not

39:14.800 --> 39:15.920
meet a death.

39:15.920 --> 39:19.360
Things that are not pleasurable and citing

39:19.360 --> 39:23.240
the life of intoxicating, they're not a problem.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.040
So he can drink water, way, things that are not desirable,

39:27.040 --> 39:29.640
but serve the purpose.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.880
But things that are desirable are the ones

39:31.880 --> 39:34.440
where sensuality is.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.000
So basically, by freeing yourself from that,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.320
by seeing the danger in desire, you feel yourself from desire.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.440
That doesn't mean you stop eating, you stop walking,

39:42.440 --> 39:44.040
you stop dressing, you stop talking,

39:44.040 --> 39:46.680
you stop doing whatever you were doing.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.160
Unless, obviously, whatever you were doing

39:48.160 --> 39:49.720
was an awesome based on sensuality.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.200
Then you won't be doing that.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.440
So that's exactly what that man realises.

39:54.440 --> 39:58.240
It's that sweet tip of the pleasure that he has to say,

39:58.240 --> 40:02.560
because that's where the poison is.

40:02.560 --> 40:06.360
So all he has to do is drink water, bring something else,

40:06.360 --> 40:09.880
that it's not sensuality, that it's not craving after,

40:09.880 --> 40:28.840
that it's not delighted in, something that is neutral.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.720
He's so mean, it doesn't give you rise.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.200
To desire, you have to.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.040
But you can only do that when you full understood the danger

40:37.040 --> 40:39.280
of desire, when you can spend your life eating,

40:39.280 --> 40:43.600
the blank food and so on, and still be bound by sensuality.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.200
Because obviously, you're not seeing

40:45.200 --> 40:49.040
that desire is dangerous, you're just trying to avoid it,

40:49.040 --> 40:50.040
prevent it from rising.

41:02.920 --> 41:06.240
But the only way to prevent it from rising, once and for all,

41:06.240 --> 41:11.760
is to develop full dispassion in regards to it, in regard to it,

41:11.760 --> 41:16.480
not by trying to avoid things.

41:16.480 --> 41:19.560
You have to start by avoiding, either by restraining,

41:19.560 --> 41:23.560
but that in itself will not lead to understanding.

41:23.560 --> 41:27.080
I think I said before, it's a necessary prerequisite

41:27.080 --> 41:29.240
of as a basis for developing and understanding,

41:29.240 --> 41:33.240
but in itself, avoiding, I mean, still avoiding sensuality,

41:33.240 --> 41:38.040
but avoiding itself will not lead to the end of sensuality,

41:38.040 --> 41:44.280
seeing pleasure as pain, seeing sweet as poison,

41:44.280 --> 41:46.800
that is what's going to free you from sensuality,

41:46.800 --> 41:48.800
and then you can engage in neutral stuff.

41:48.800 --> 41:55.800
Like what the city is called in English.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.800
In what I just said before he started reading the sutra,

41:58.800 --> 42:01.800
that's what meditation is, inward exploration,

42:01.800 --> 42:05.800
figured like, made understanding, practicing understanding.

42:05.800 --> 42:10.800
There's no method that will tell you how to do the understanding,

42:10.800 --> 42:21.800
figured like, made understanding, practicing understanding.
