00:00.000 --> 00:14.560
How can I get rid of attachments to things that are to be free from being attached to things?

00:14.560 --> 00:27.080
Well the first step is to stop, stop using them for again in pleasure.

00:27.080 --> 00:33.460
So you have to refrain from obtaining pleasure through the things you are attached to.

00:33.460 --> 00:40.320
Because attachment is inseparable from the notion of being pleasant, whatever it is.

00:40.320 --> 00:48.700
If it's your house, if it's your spouse, your children, your friends, attachment to them

00:48.700 --> 00:54.460
means to that degree, there is a degree of pleasure in them, in their company, in their

00:54.460 --> 01:00.360
presence, in what they can do for you, what they can provide you with and so on.

01:00.360 --> 01:05.760
So you have to basically stop maintaining that attachment through constantly exhibiting

01:05.760 --> 01:14.840
the behavior of that, of gaining pleasure through them.

01:14.840 --> 01:21.440
And then start seeing the opposite, that it's actually not pleasant but dangerous to be

01:21.440 --> 01:25.520
attached, yeah. Because if you start, all you have to do, like say in telling you

01:25.520 --> 01:31.680
you attach your house, all you have to do is start pondering, thinking on the quite

01:31.680 --> 01:37.640
a real possibility of losing it, like through a natural catastrophes or anything, basically

01:37.640 --> 01:43.980
to things can happen, that are beyond your control, they can happen at any time to you.

01:43.980 --> 01:49.320
And then you realize that your whole world of dependence upon those things, that's what

01:49.320 --> 01:56.600
attachment is, it's going to be swept away with it, and it's very dangerous.

01:56.600 --> 02:04.480
So when you recognize that perilous situation you are right there, in it you will, well,

02:04.480 --> 02:10.600
you will want to be not attached to those things, and that's a first step really.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.360
How much do you throw those things away?

02:13.360 --> 02:18.480
No, see destroying those things does not free you from attachment or the things, because

02:18.480 --> 02:23.160
the attachment is not the things, it's your attitude in regard to them.

02:23.160 --> 02:28.320
Now it is the most natural response then, like when I'm attached to this, I'll throw

02:28.320 --> 02:34.080
it away, I'll break it apart, I'll say note it, but that doesn't affect your mind,

02:34.080 --> 02:38.760
your attitude of attachment, which means another thing will slot in, instead of it sooner

02:38.760 --> 02:40.760
later, you're going to give in.

02:40.760 --> 02:44.920
So in order to free yourself from attachment, you need to basically discern the reasons

02:44.920 --> 02:49.320
for your attachment, and things are not the reasons, they are the objects of your attachment.

02:49.320 --> 02:56.400
The reasons is, well, fear for your life, fear for your safety, fear for your health, fear

02:56.400 --> 03:01.120
of boredom, fear of not having anything to do, fear of loneliness, all those things that

03:01.120 --> 03:05.560
people are afraid of, and that's where they're attached to other people and to other things.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.400
So that's what you want to overcome, those fears, and not act out of those fears, and the

03:09.400 --> 03:14.880
very first step of overcoming any fear is being aware of it, admitting it, discerning it,

03:14.880 --> 03:25.840
you can't tell from someone's output appearance that they have free from attachment.

03:25.840 --> 03:33.680
No, no, no, no, no, a person can be theoretically, can be living in a very nice house, a very comfortable

03:33.680 --> 03:40.400
life, have lots of luxuries, but internally genuinely not be attached to it, but it's highly

03:40.400 --> 03:44.680
unlikely today that that will be the case because it takes a lot of effort, and if a person

03:44.680 --> 03:49.760
is able to make that effort and gain their wisdom, they wouldn't be investing all their

03:49.760 --> 03:55.400
time in maintaining all those things and luxuries, they're probably giving it up naturally,

03:55.400 --> 04:02.000
not as a response of, oh, I'm bound by this, I'm sort of trapped by my attachment, so I'll

04:02.000 --> 04:04.600
just destroy the objects of it and pretend I'm not attached.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.600
No, they would be overcoming it through proper understanding, they would be removing the

04:08.600 --> 04:15.440
actual attachment, not affecting things, so then if something were to happen to those things,

04:15.440 --> 04:21.800
they wouldn't suffer an account of it, but it doesn't mean they seek out the destruction

04:21.800 --> 04:25.480
of those things beforehand in order to prove themselves that they're not, if you need

04:25.480 --> 04:29.320
to prove to yourself that you're attached, means you don't know, sorry, if you need to

04:29.320 --> 04:33.040
prove to yourself that you're not attached, means you don't know that you're not attached,

04:33.040 --> 04:37.480
means you're doubting, it means you are attached, if you're not free from doubt, you can't

04:37.480 --> 04:49.000
say you're free, so outwardly, it's not a measure of attachment, a person can have a big

04:49.000 --> 04:54.200
family, many children, but not actually be attached to them if he has wisdom, so he'll

04:54.200 --> 04:59.720
be helping them, being there for them, but if something happens, he won't be destroyed

04:59.720 --> 05:10.680
and completely, completely unable to continue his life.
