1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,400
There are many different questions. I don't know if we will get to them all today. I don't

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,600
know how much time you have. One question which I had asked on YouTube, maybe we could

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:37,840
start with that was about the term peripheral awareness. Basically, I read your essay about

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,880
it and I listened to a couple of videos. Basically, whenever you start talking about peripheral

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:53,560
or awareness, I would get a little bit confused because the word is not, it really can begin

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:00,680
to push it different ways. I was trying to understand exactly what it means, the peripheral

7
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:09,160
awareness. What I had asked on when I wrote on YouTube, I basically tried to describe how

8
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:19,600
I was understanding it so that you could tell me if it was correct or not. How I gathered

9
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,240
from it was that it's basically like, let's say if I'm sitting here talking to you on

10
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,720
the chair, an example you talk about having peripheral awareness with the reference point

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,920
of sitting. For example, I'm sitting here talking to you on the chair, formulating my

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:44,240
question and figuring out how to put it well. I should have a background awareness of the

13
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:57,680
fact that I'm sitting, for example. Maybe before we get too far into it, it's not necessarily

14
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,160
like you must have it in a sense of, I must make this effort and maintain this background.

15
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,680
You just need to recognize it as that which is already there. That's in those talks I

16
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,720
think I was, when I was describing peripheral awareness, I ended up talking about the knowledge

17
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,960
which is already peripheral in its nature. You already know you're seated, you already

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,240
know the door is closed, you already know you're talking to me. All these things are

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,800
already there. You are not attending them. You don't need to keep telling to yourself

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
while you're talking to me that you are seated, you are seated. But if I were to ask in the

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
middle of your sentence about something different, are you seated? You would immediately have

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,920
the answer. Which means that knowledge is already there without not being required to

23
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,240
be directly attended. So it's peripheral. Peripheral awareness can be basically the recognition

24
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,720
of that which you already know there which is a basis of your situation. So it's subtle

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,280
because often yes, people would kind of hear it and then immediately say, Peripheral awareness

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,200
is something I must do in this peripheral manner. But then they end up still in the same sense

27
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:22,000
trying to attend to it. But as I said, instead of attending to or I'm seated, I'm seated,

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,200
you just want to recognize the level of that knowledge and not keep having to answer it

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:36,440
to yourself because you already know the answer. Okay, so then, but what would be the difference

30
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:44,080
between like somebody who is practicing, practicing peripheral awareness or kind of working on

31
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
it is something you still have to work on. If I understand well, it's like not because

32
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,760
otherwise what I'm trying to understand is the difference between somebody practicing

33
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,560
mindfulness as you explain. And somebody who's like a normal person just going about their

34
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,200
daily life who also knows that the door is closed, who also knows that they're seated,

35
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,480
who also knows that they're yeah, but they're not that they're talking, they're not aware

36
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,000
of it. They know if they ask the question, but they don't have the awareness of their

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,320
knowledge, persisting is a base of their situation. Because if they did, they would experience

38
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,480
this passion. They would not be able to engage with central desires and ill will yet they

39
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,680
do, which means they don't have the right knowledge. Like, yes, if they stop and ask

40
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,040
themselves, they will know it. So it's not knowing that the door is closed or you're

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,920
seated, but it's being aware of the knowledge that the door is closed and you're seated

42
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,560
while you're engaged with other things. So it's really the relationship between the peripheral

43
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,400
and what you're choosing to attend to. And that's exactly why the mindfulness is that

44
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,960
framework, the container. And that's exactly why it needs developing. Now, just, yeah,

45
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,440
I know I'm seated, full stop, I completed the mindfulness. No, is the relationship between

46
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,680
your knowledge that you're seated and what you choose to do, intend, speak, think while

47
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,040
you're seated on the basis of that situation.

48
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:15,760
Okay, so you say it's okay, it's the relationship between the knowledge that you are seated and

49
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:30,760
what you choose to do on the basis of that situation. So now, okay, so you're aware that

50
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,840
you're seated, you know that you're aware of that you know that you are seated in the

51
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,080
sense. And like, my other kind of question was, so this, like this, like knowing being

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,840
aware of being seated is basically, you're basically aware of a sensation, right? Like

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:54,320
being aware that the of your position, like you don't need sensations for the knowledge

54
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,600
of your seated position, you have the knowledge, which is why you know what sensations to look

55
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,320
for. So the knowledge comes first, not the sensations. It's usually that expectation of

56
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,560
your attention to find something more substantial that needs to discern these sensations, they

57
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,000
would then be a representation of the seated, but you already know you're seated. You can

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,400
answer to me, are you seated? You could give me immediate answer before you tap into your

59
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,360
sensations of seated body, which is always secondary to the knowledge that you are already

60
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,840
seated. So that's how many it's actually shot like that, then just attending to the sensations

61
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:36,480
of, I don't know, touching the chair or something like that. It's the knowledge of it.

62
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,760
But I know that I'm seated because I chose to sit down, like I chose to sit down and

63
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,680
now I am now I'm seated. Yeah. And you don't need sensations to confirm to you what you

64
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,560
already know that you're seated. They're completely redundant actually, how your body feels and

65
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,880
how the chair where it presses you and stuff, it's completely redundant. You're seated and

66
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,920
you said to yourself, you know you're seated because you chose to sit down. There were

67
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,920
no sensations involved in your choice of sitting down. It was like, Oh, I want to sit down.

68
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,320
I need to sit down. It's better to sit down. All these other intentions. Yet when we speak

69
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,400
about it, people think, Oh, since it, why would you bring the sensations into it then?

70
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,120
When you realize had nothing to do with neither your decision, nor the knowledge of being

71
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,840
seated. I mean, I know why because everybody does that. That's like the natural kind of

72
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,160
how must look closer to the sensations or something as if somehow that analysis more

73
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,920
of you know, you see, if you want to analyze the nature of being seated, as exactly as

74
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,840
you did kind of spontaneously, our intention to sit down brought me here, which means your

75
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,880
intention to sit down is still present there with you. It wasn't half an hour ago when

76
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,600
you said it remains enduring while you're seated. Because if your intention to be seated changes,

77
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,960
you will stand up or lay down. So and that's another thing. Yeah, in the relationship with

78
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,760
those other in the same peripheral awareness talks is that knowing the intention why you

79
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,880
want it like, Oh, I'm doing this. And then knowing that while you're doing it, your intention

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,280
is persistently kind of it's enduring. There is a binding factor. You're not like going

81
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,040
to moment to moment awareness. No, the knowledge of what you want to do is the uniform factor

82
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,240
of all of your particular little actions. So the knowledge of what you're going to do

83
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,400
is basically the framework of your current action. If you want to be mindful of it.

84
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:43,280
Okay, so if I try to kind of put it in in language for under six years old, it would

85
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,280
be like, yeah, basically, I know that I know that I'm sitting down based on the fact that

86
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,720
I had the intention to sit down. And it's like, and that I and that I still choose to keep

87
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:02,400
sitting down. This is like the main, this is the first thing that comes. Like, or the.

88
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Because I agree, I agree that sensation, like, don't need to take that further in a sense.

89
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,760
What do I do now? Like with this knowledge of being seated, you just need to start using

90
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,880
it as a basis. They will take away from being self centered with your point of view towards

91
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,240
what you attend to and see whatever you choose to attend to on a basis of this seated situation.

92
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,040
That's where the Buddha would say, like, when he was still the bodhisattva in the forest walking

93
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,560
in doing a walking meditation or something, and he would say, if there is like an unwholesome

94
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,120
state with a rise in my mind, fear or something, I would not change my position until I first

95
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,480
dispel the fear. Then if I happened to be seated, and then there was lust or fear, again, I

96
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,840
wouldn't stand up until I dispelled the fear. So he wouldn't change the basis of his situation

97
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,080
because it would mean he acted out of lust or fear or anything unwholesome. So he used

98
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,040
the basis of situation as an enduring framework, container for whatever present phenomenon

99
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,600
has been kind of besetting his mind. But without the factorial basis of your situation, such

100
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,360
as your body, your body posture, your current enduring feeling, anything from such a patana,

101
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,480
you will be engaged with a current state of mind through your point of view. And that's

102
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,200
exactly what that self-centeredness and conceit involves. It's not like the people are choose

103
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,480
to be conceited. They just don't know. They have no other reference point between them

104
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,280
and what they attend to. So the knowledge I'm describing, it's not like, oh, I need

105
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,640
to clarify this knowledge more in a sense of, get more details about it, although that

106
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,880
can be helpful for somebody. It's more like, now that I'm clear, now that I know it, I

107
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,840
need to stop attending that and use it as a basis for what I'm attending. And that's

108
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,840
what I mean, the relationship between the two, that then eventually you develop that

109
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,560
sufficiently enough, your sense of self, the self-centered point of view that chooses

110
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,880
to attend and thinks it's the receptor of these things that come through senses will

111
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,840
be made redundant. And then it's just, as the Buddha would say inside the patana, oh,

112
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,320
he knows there is the presence of the last full mind, as the last full mind, there is

113
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,840
a non-last full mind, as a non-last full mind, elated mind, depressed mind, doesn't

114
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,920
matter. It's not like, I am depressed, I am lustful, I'm hateful or something like that.

115
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,520
Yeah, yeah, this, this I understand, I mean, I, I agree, the, that's,

116
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,320
Yeah, I think many people get this part, many people get this part from satipatana. But

117
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,840
what I'm trying to describe is the only way to get it is to establish the proper basis

118
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,880
of mindfulness of the level of the knowledge, not on the level of kind of sensations or

119
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,240
something that I choose, I choose to attend as representative of the seated position,

120
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,240
which means still puts you in the center, the driving seat.

121
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:59,520
Yeah, and yeah, this I, this I agree to, but like, I agree, like always, because always

122
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,840
the mind, like always people are just, like, looking at what they see, what they hear,

123
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,240
what you, what you think, what you are, like, what I, what I want, what I don't want, what

124
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,240
I feel, what I, so this, like, if you look always outside, this I see, that if you're

125
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,400
just looking outside at the objects of my, my senses or object of my, like, outside

126
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,440
of my attention, then this is no good, because it's just I am, I am seeing this, I am hearing

127
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,640
this, I am automatically, it's this, what I would add there is that even the notion

128
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,480
of sensations is also another thing that's outside, outside to self-centeredness. Yeah.

129
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,360
So the only thing that's behind the only thing that's not outside of your point of view,

130
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,520
not like the where your attention can land is what's peripheral to it, which is the level

131
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,880
of the knowledge. You cannot make that into physical sense, like, because that becomes

132
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,360
something you can send. So even your body posture is to be known as such, not attended

133
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,440
and felt as often describing contemporary sort of Buddhist teachings and so on. Yeah.

134
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,280
So that's the, that's the difference. Yeah. I mean, yeah, like I understand, I, I agree

135
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,640
with you about sensations and that was why I was like, kind of doubtful about this, kind

136
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,880
of doubtful about the idea of, of it, if it consists of sensations, then, then it's not

137
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,800
correct because you're just paying, yeah, you're just paying attention to something

138
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,600
that's like theory outside of you. Yeah. Yeah. There's no wisdom that can arise from there.

139
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,160
And wisdom is like, as you say, it has to be on the level of what knows the thing that

140
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,120
the thing that knows, like the wisdom comes from the, from basically completely bypassing

141
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,600
and extinguishing that self-centered point of view. When, as I said, your sense of self

142
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,840
is made redundant. Like you just know, the body is as such, feelings as as such, thoughts

143
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,520
are as, are as such and so on. So there is no like, oh, I am choosing this, there is

144
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,880
choice present. And then you choose whether to attend to it further or not based on the

145
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,000
wisdom you developed. Yeah. And that's when somebody who is not free from that self-centered

146
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,800
is they cannot choose to cease to be self-centered because that would be a self-centered choice

147
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,680
they make. So they need to undermine it and hardy undermine it by digging under. And what's

148
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,720
basically under from where you're standing, it can be called peripheral, not direct in

149
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,160
front of you. So that's why I use that word basically just to give the idea to people.

150
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,200
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So if I just to back up a bit, like now, yeah, you know, you kind

151
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,720
of came back to it anyway. When you use the word peripheral, if I understand well, you

152
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:03,200
can correct me. It's basically, is it meaning that it's not something that's not an object

153
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:10,200
of your senses? It's not an object like what is what is not the direct object of of your

154
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,240
attention? Yeah, exactly. Because if it becomes a direct object of your attention, then something

155
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,440
else is peripheral because now what you're attending can only be direct as opposed to

156
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:30,920
peripheral. Yeah. So it's not an object of an object of your senses. So all like, so it's

157
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,920
not a sensation, not that you can't be just paying attention to sensations or sounds or

158
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,840
or whatever. And when you said example that you have to be kind of develop the awareness

159
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,560
on the level of knowledge, then this is on the level of like being aware of the almost

160
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,400
being aware of the attention itself, like being kind of well, being being aware of your

161
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,240
attention, what's peripheral to that which you're attending? And that's exactly the

162
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,080
definition of the only someone has a car, the only so meaning the womb of your attention,

163
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,280
not the attention. So in the same sense, and I cannot see itself, but you know that there

164
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,360
is an eye present for as long as there is a sight present. So it's already, it's already

165
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,200
the peripheral relationship even within your own senses, sense organs and sense objects.

166
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,160
So that's the definition of the only someone's secret is basically not like knowing where

167
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,360
my attention came from in the past or something analyzing the roots of my attention. No, it's

168
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,640
not presently the basis for my current attention, a basis that cannot be attended. Because if

169
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,040
I attend to it, something else is the basis for my current attending of that which I thought

170
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,400
was the basis. So if you keep trying to kind of attend it, it's like a dog chasing its

171
00:16:49,400 --> 00:17:13,360
own tail to the extent you try to reach you to that extent the tail escapes you.

172
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:21,680
Okay, so you were saying about, you mentioned about actions as well, about like the intention

173
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:31,640
of your actions, how you can be like have the peripheral, like yeah, keep this as the basis

174
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,800
of mindfulness essentially. And this I found is interesting because I, because it's sort

175
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:48,480
of easier for, it's easier to understand than like a body posture. Because this is like

176
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,040
if you intend, like if you intend to do something, if you have an intention of even just moving

177
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:04,960
or speaking or something, then like to be, to keep the awareness of attention I can understand

178
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:13,400
this easier as a, as a base mindfulness, because also because it's something that like is really

179
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,320
directly linked to removing, removing KLSA because your intentions are driven either

180
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:27,840
driven usually by, by greed, by like a version or by, by, by a MOHA by not knowing if I understand

181
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,040
well. So then like being aware of the intention. But what I was less clear about was how you

182
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:45,440
were kind of talking of it as a sort of like a general background of your like general

183
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,400
background of your experience or something. Maybe I'm not remembering it well. But as

184
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,160
I go from what I can observe an intention is always something quite, it's more like

185
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,840
a particular, it's quite specific, like you, let's see, let's see, let's see, right now

186
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,080
I have the intention of speaking this word. Yeah, yeah, no, that is a choice what you're

187
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,800
talking about, which is more particular. But choice is basically intentional intention.

188
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,960
But the only reason you can make the choice is because you have general intentions as

189
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,920
possibilities that you can choose, because you can choose to speak or be silent. You

190
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,240
can choose to say one thing or the other. And then it becomes particular making of the

191
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:37,560
choice. But that choice can only be made because these intentions are already given as possibilities.

192
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:45,240
So that's the difference between like intention and intentional intention, which is what we

193
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,080
commonly call a choice. That's the difference between like the relationship between like

194
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,880
the intentional mind, the chitta, and then chetana, which is the actual intention of

195
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,760
the choice that you make on account of the mind, they gave you this option. So the last

196
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,680
full mind will lean your choices towards choices of lust and so on. Now, if you have wisdom on

197
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,640
account towards the whole situation, that's how you can then choose to say no, which is

198
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,760
your first step basically sense restraint and so on. But the intention I'm talking about,

199
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,640
it's not on the level of when you intentionally intend to it and then make a choice. That is

200
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,600
particular. And the only reason it can be particular is because generally the intentions are given

201
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,080
and waiting to, because you can also change your choice as well. You make a choice to do

202
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,080
something, then you change your mind. You still have the other options there.

203
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:46,920
Yeah. And those options are not particular. They don't sit in front of you.

204
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,840
So when you say intention, you mean like basically the all the possibilities of what you can do.

205
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,200
Pretty much exactly. Yeah. Thoughts, images, damas on the level of possibilities. That's exactly what

206
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,720
what intentions are in that sense. And that's why you then can choose to intend

207
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,720
with a certain leaning of your mind and so on. And that's when it becomes a choice.

208
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,760
So that's you are not responsible for the intentions for their arising,

209
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,240
but you're responsible for intentionally intending them on the basis of the last

210
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,640
a version of delusion. And it's those choices that then will make those intentions arise more

211
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,120
or less for you. So person who keeps acting out of lust will have more options of lust

212
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,320
presented to him. That's like even for the first six, seven years, Mara was harassing the Buddha,

213
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,200
hoping he will take a bite until he realized, no, his mind will never turn to this. And then

214
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,920
he left him alone. And in many other similes that was described the experience of an Arahant.

215
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,000
Now that these intentions suddenly the recognitions of last a version will kind of poof just disappear

216
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,640
in a second. But Arahant's intentional intention of those things he's incapable of. So eventually

217
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,720
these things will completely cool down. And then even as these options that he's not responsible

218
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,040
for, it will cease to appear like the flies will cease to come to the basically, I don't know,

219
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,000
rotting meat if there is no more rotting meat left lying around. The flies will fly around a bit

220
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,600
longer hoping for it or crows. Oh yeah, that was a similar in the suitors. It was a crow. Like Mara

221
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,040
was like a crow seeking what can it bite? What can it pick on? But the Buddha provided nothing

222
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:35,720
and then the crow just left him. So these intentionalities have just evaporated eventually

223
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,840
because they haven't been maintained and fed through these intentional intentions of last,

224
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,920
a version, distraction and so on.

225
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,960
Okay, so there's a point here. I'm struggling to get a hold of the gears.

226
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:59,000
Okay, so in the beginning you, okay, so we have the level of like all the possibilities of what

227
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,240
you can do. So but this is like for everybody at any time there's always the possibility of,

228
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:11,640
let's say, like of the, I don't know, let's just say you have an itch. Everybody can decide whether

229
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,440
to scratch the itch or not to scratch the itch. Okay, there's the both both possibilities there.

230
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:24,280
Then you have the, then you have the like automatic decision or choice is not really

231
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,560
automatic. You've decided to scratch the itch mostly for most people unless you are aware enough

232
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,400
of the itch, like if you're aware enough beforehand to decide not to or to have the choice that

233
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:43,160
you see in there. And you couldn't continue.

234
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Well, yeah, no, that's exactly it. You have the two choices because you don't have any other

235
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,000
knowledge. That's exactly why knowledge results in liberation. But if you say the gained knowledge

236
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,920
that you shouldn't scratch, now you have an option to not scratch and you have a reason as an option

237
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:08,600
to choose to, which you didn't have before. But if you develop the knowledge sufficiently enough

238
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:15,320
and stop scratching, you will heal. So knowledge resulted in liberation. So it's not that these

239
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,040
choices are universally present for everyone. I mean, of course, scratching nature or not scratching

240
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,920
nature. But what we are talking about is the choices on the level of your mind for greed or

241
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:33,400
non-greed, a version or non-aversion, delusion, not delusion. And now choices of greed have like

242
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,840
myriad ways of manifesting itself and so on. But all of them share the common nature of being

243
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,720
rooted in greed, which is what you keep persistingly choosing. So then if you start abstaining from

244
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,400
that and learn that maybe greed is not good, suddenly you do recognize the choice of sensory

245
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,120
strength, like sensory strength, for example, an average man today in the world, he doesn't even

246
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,800
have that as an option. It's inconceivable for a person to be sensory strained by their own will.

247
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,320
It needs to be some sort of religious practice, some sort of faith-based determination in their

248
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,120
mind. They cannot fathom it in any other way. But say you start actually understanding the

249
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,800
nature of your condition and start seeing for yourself that scratching the itch is fundamentally

250
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:22,040
making things worse. Now you have an option that you directly see as valuable, which you did not

251
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,960
have before. So intentions change on the basis of your knowledge and basis of your other intent

252
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,000
because you chose to learn this, you chose to listen to the Dharma, you chose to read the suttas.

253
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,880
So you are responsible now for cultivation of new intentions later on. And that's exactly what

254
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,040
was said, even Nibbana being asankata, being undetermined, it's actually determined, determined by what,

255
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,560
by one's decision to practice and develop it back in the day, not immediately, but you know,

256
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,320
when he left the household life and so on. So the choices he made towards Nibbana determine

257
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,640
the Nibbana eventually resulted in it.

258
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:17,720
Yeah, so no, yeah, this I understand.

259
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:31,240
So what I was trying to do, I was trying to become clear on the, okay, so now you say,

260
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,520
like for everybody, they don't even realize, example, because they don't, I would not say,

261
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,560
yeah, most people you don't, they don't think about or you don't realize that you have a choice

262
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:50,040
in regard to, again, regard to what you do, because most of the time, you're like, you're just

263
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:57,160
automatically like, by default, you're driven by a reader version delusion from what I can observe.

264
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,960
Well, it becomes, it becomes by default, because people choose to avoid responsibility

265
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,520
for their own choices and their own actions. That's why we always go back to that as well,

266
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:15,160
as a prerequisite for the right view for the right mindfulness, like a pre prerequisite is

267
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,440
accepting responsibility for basically your choices, your intentions, your actions for everything you

268
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,320
feel, even if it's not your fault, you need to accept responsibility first, because that will

269
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,880
prevent you then from fueling ignoring the nature of your own choice that you do choose to make

270
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:42,440
as such. So, acting out of greedy version delusion becomes automatic, because you are choosing oblivion

271
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,200
of towards your responsibility, you're ignoring it, you're turning a blind eye that then results

272
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,240
in automatically following desires or scratching, and that's why then people say, oh, it's not my

273
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,200
fault, I just have this, it's true, it's not your fault that your desire is automatic, but it is

274
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,520
your fault that you ignore responsibility in regard to that, which is what makes that desire

275
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,320
look automatic. And the reason people ignore that responsibility is it's unpleasant, and they don't

276
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,120
have enough knowledge with them, they haven't been told enough, they haven't understood sufficiently

277
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:19,400
that actually, despite being unpleasant, accepting responsibility is beneficial for me.

278
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:28,680
So, they need to learn, without knowledge, they will not do it. So, it's a vicious circle

279
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,680
of automatically perpetuating that, which makes their desire automatic.

280
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:47,320
Yeah, I mean, what I was, I was referring to as well, like the fact that,

281
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:56,680
let's say somebody is in a conversation, and now the, like one of the, one of the people starts,

282
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:03,960
I'm just going to give an example, one of the people sort of points out to something, the other

283
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,880
one has done wrong, like, let's say you, like you have acted irresponsibly or something like that,

284
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,440
and now, like, what happens for most people in this kind of situation, because speaking is

285
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,640
especially difficult, like, they will automatically just want to defend themselves, like automatically

286
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,480
you just will reply without any, without considering or without thinking about it, without, like,

287
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,200
even if you know, like, even if you want to practice or you know that, like, I am not supposed to,

288
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,160
I don't want to react in this way, I don't want to, like, act defensively, or I don't want to,

289
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,640
like, I don't want to behave in this way, I don't want to behave like in this sort of angry

290
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:50,920
reaction, but the reaction, like, the mind makes the reaction before you are able to,

291
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,640
like, practice restraint in it, and then people only realize afterwards, like, you become, then

292
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:03,560
you have regret, oh no, I said that, I shouldn't have said that, so, like, in this sense, the,

293
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:11,160
like, the choice of react, the choice of replying in a defensive way or in a kind of angry way,

294
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,480
this is something that, because at that, at that moment, there was no awareness there,

295
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,200
there was no, like, block, there was nothing to, like, to stop it from arriving, like, the mind

296
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:30,760
makes this by, by itself, and then you realize afterwards, so, so what I was kind of wondering

297
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,520
is, is, like, is this what you were, I was wondering if this is part of what you were referring to

298
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,960
in the sense, like, the difference between, like, you have all the, you have the option of

299
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:48,040
not replying in that way, of not reacting defensively, you do have the, like, you do have the choice,

300
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:54,200
but because the, because the mind is sort of, like, it just, it just reacts automatically

301
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,840
without you, without you being aware, without you knowing, and then afterwards, you realize,

302
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,320
well, yeah, not quite, at the point you did, it's automatic at the time, and as I said,

303
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,840
the reason why it's automatic is because you maintain the basis for that, so you want to see

304
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,040
where the problem is, in the same sense, you know, having a fever, when you catch a virus,

305
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,720
it's automatic, but what if you learn how to prevent catching a virus, you won't get a fever,

306
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,080
so having a mind move and respond, even if you don't want to and you can't catch it in time,

307
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,520
means, do you are doing something or maintaining something on some level that then makes that

308
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,200
mind overwhelmed, and the very first thing it's in the last talk we posted now, it comes down to that,

309
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:43,720
whether your value is towards management or towards uprooting, so if you think, you shouldn't be

310
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,360
saying this, you shouldn't be doing that, that's on the level of management, with as I said, everybody

311
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,080
starts like that, but really, you want to see, I don't want to be affected, whether I choose to

312
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,120
speak or not, I should not be affected emotionally, but what was said to me, and for that, you are

313
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,320
responsible, and then you realize, that is the basis for my mind automatically blurting things

314
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,480
out that I shouldn't have said, I was affected, so how can then I not be affected, then I don't

315
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:18,920
have to worry what mind will say, because it won't be rooted in self-defense, gratuitous, or something

316
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,800
like that, which means he won't be on wholesome, that's why Arhan doesn't need to worry about his

317
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,600
actions in a sense, because he knows whatever he chooses to do will not be rooted in greed,

318
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,720
aversion, or distraction, or delusion, so in that sense, it's not automatic, that's what I mean,

319
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,880
mind blurting stuff, it's automatic, but you, through your other choices, when you're not affected,

320
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,520
arm maintaining the basis, which then makes the mind blur things out verbally, or for some people

321
00:32:46,520 --> 00:33:08,040
physically as well. Okay, so now kind of jumping many, jumping many subjects, but yeah, no, I

322
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:23,960
actually listened to your last talk yesterday, and I agree with the point that it's not enough

323
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,640
to just become angry, let's say, when somebody says something that points out something you have

324
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,960
done wrong or to want to defend, but even if you're kind of able to restrain yourself, not to say

325
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,880
it is not good enough, like it's not good enough to avoid saying this, I mean, it would still be

326
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,760
better than saying the words and then having regret and having conflict. And that's another

327
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,720
thing, by the way, if the mind automatically blurred stuff out means you haven't developed

328
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:57,000
restraint sufficiently, doesn't matter how pressing, whatever you want to defend yourself against

329
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
the choice of not acting out by body by speech by mind always remains there, the fact that you

330
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,600
acted out, the mind said something or thought something means you need to develop more, you need

331
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:15,000
to be able to hold it more without actually letting in the more you become aware of that lack, so to

332
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,440
speak, the more you'll be able to develop it. But if you think not you specifically, but if a person

333
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,560
might think, oh, the speech happened automatically means you will not look for an upgrade there,

334
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,200
because you don't feel responsible for it now, see, you said, Oh, it's automatic, wasn't my fault,

335
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:39,160
my fault is later, or avoiding my fault is later what I do. No, it was automatic, but there is a

336
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:45,560
certain basis for mind acting automatically, basis that lacks the restraint. So you can even,

337
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:51,320
doesn't matter how automatic it is, you can always choose no. And that's the restraint. And then the

338
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,840
wisdom can come out of it. So even even in a common sense of sensory strain, there is still

339
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,480
something to be done there. Not necessarily, I must discern this basis and why am I affected in the

340
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,880
first place? Yeah, that's all on the level of the person and developing wisdom. But even if you

341
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,360
don't get any of them, you can still keep your mouth shut, literally. So if you blurt out means

342
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:24,600
your verbal restraint hasn't been strengthened enough. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, like, it's still

343
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,400
I agree, it's still your fault. Like if you still, if you, if you kind of blurt out words automatically,

344
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,680
then it's still your, you're still your fault. But it's your fault kind of in the sense that you

345
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,200
were not, you were not mindful enough, and you were not restrained enough at that point.

346
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,920
Yeah. And from the point of view of one who practices, that's a big fault. Without fixing that fault,

347
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,960
there is no progress. So it's not like, okay, I mean, sure, it's not as bad as somebody who is

348
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,160
no interesting practice, but you don't want to be comparing to that side of things. So restraint

349
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,760
has not been developed. Thus wisdom cannot arise in regard to speech, in regard to being affected

350
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,920
by what other, what other people say. I cannot approach my emotional kind of vulnerability,

351
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,840
so to speak, until I fix this first. So that's, I mean, it's not automatic at all, in a sense.

352
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,360
Like it's just a symptom for which you're not directly responsible in the sense of you are not

353
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:25,640
generating the symptom, but you're fully responsible for, for the reason of that symptom. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:33,240
I mean, yeah, when I say automatic, I kind of, it's a way of, of, of saying that like, even though,

355
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,560
like you don't, yeah, it's the way of saying that you kind of don't deliberately sort of decide,

356
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,840
now I will speak these words, because you know that you're not supposed to say them.

357
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,560
Yeah. That's why we need to, we need to actually start kind of fabricating and investing effort

358
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,960
to develop responsibility for things that don't necessarily feel their fault, because that's the

359
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:06,440
only way to then actually approach things correctly. And, but especially in regard to speech, it's,

360
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:17,080
like it's a, it's an interesting point, because, like this, what, because we, we, we, we have said

361
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:23,640
and we both, like we both agree that you, if you are, if you are speaking things without considering

362
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,920
and then you then have regret later, then it's, it means that you're doing something wrong,

363
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,800
means that you haven't developed enough, enough restraint in regard to your speech and you don't

364
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,320
have enough mindfulness, but like the kind of mindfulness that needs, this is the point I'm

365
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,520
trying to come to actually is that the type of mindfulness that needs to be there in order to

366
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,960
be able to practice restraint in regards to the words that you're saying, obviously it can't be

367
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:57,160
just about playing with like the sensation of sitting on the chair or being like mindful of the,

368
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:05,640
like something outside object of your senses, but like so from, from my understanding like if you

369
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,000
need to be aware, basically you need to be aware of your own mind, like the, of how, like the,

370
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:19,480
of the fact that these, like you're hearing these words and now what happens in your mind as you

371
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,840
hear them, like do you have the, does the mind react with anger or not, and now like if it went

372
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,840
and, and now like even if it's reacting in anger, then if you are aware at that point,

373
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,680
then you're able to stop this, but if you are not aware, then you're not able to stop it,

374
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,480
or if you were kind of aware, if you were more aware, then you can like be able to

375
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,440
not allow the mind to react in anger. So how would you then, how would you then go about being aware,

376
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,920
being aware about being aware of your mind? How would you do that then? How would you then not,

377
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,080
not lose awareness of your mind? So then you don't say something out of carelessness.

378
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,840
Well, if somebody is, but you need to just maintain awareness of your mind, essentially,

379
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,320
something that you need to practice. No, but they say I don't know what awareness of the mind is,

380
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:17,160
or in other words, it might mean one thing for me, another thing for you. So yeah, how can I understand

381
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,440
what the awareness of the mind is for you? How can I practically do it? I want to be aware of

382
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:29,160
the mind the way you're describing. How can I go about and do that? Well, it's like not to look

383
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:36,040
at what you see and what you hear, not that somebody is telling the, is saying these words,

384
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,080
but at that point, you have to maintain awareness of who hears, like what, what is hearing the,

385
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:49,080
like the, at that place or at that point, like who is, who is hearing, who is speaking,

386
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:56,360
who is, who is acting or who is, who is listening, like to be, like if you were aware at that point,

387
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:02,440
now you know, like to know, to know at the point where the words are, where the sound example is

388
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,960
meeting the mind, like because when somebody is saying words about it. So hold on, hold on,

389
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,720
hold on. So if it's about the point where the sound meets the mind, it is about things you see

390
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,520
in here, because you started by saying it's not about things you see in here. But if that's what

391
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:24,680
you're paying attention, then it is about what you're hearing. No, but what I mean is not to the,

392
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:31,160
not paying attention to the sound itself, but paying attention to how it is formed in the mind,

393
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:38,520
like how has it hurt the, like for example, I mean, I cannot give many examples from myself,

394
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:45,480
like this. Well, it's hurt as an insult. For example, I heard an insult.

395
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,560
So I was aware of hearing the sound entering my ears and everything else, but it was an insult.

396
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:59,560
So how do I be aware that some not insulted to begin with?

397
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:09,240
But the point is that it's an insult only if you're like, it's your mind that takes it as an insult,

398
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,880
like I am insulted. But the mind took it already. So how do I not be affected by that? Because everybody

399
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,160
starts by already being insulted, affected, greedy, adverse and so on. So how do I then,

400
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:31,560
not be affected by the insulted mind? Do I analyze what I heard? What do I do? No. How do I be aware

401
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,240
of it? So I'm not affected over it with by it. Sorry.

402
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:45,160
I'm not affected by it. It doesn't matter. So let me just get your question straight. So how do you

403
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,160
be aware of the aware of this in the way that you're not affected by this? Yeah, by the mind,

404
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:58,920
it's insulted. Because what you were describing to me sounds like I'm hoping.

405
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,920
Well, that's that's what I'm trying to get to. Like what you described to, it's like I'm

406
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,880
basically trying to set up this practice whereby I will hopefully not get insulted

407
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,160
by analyzing sounds or or paying attention to who hears or introducing these other questions.

408
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,440
They will sort of maybe deflate the insult. But the fact is,

409
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,000
the people start with an unenlightened mind with a mind that's not free from greedy version

410
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,600
delusion, which means insult will be first, lust will be first, aversion will be first.

411
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,840
So how am I not affected in the first place? Not how will I manage once I'm affected?

412
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,080
How will I, whoever affected now, learn to not be affected by this?

413
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:49,720
Yeah, so first of all, I mean, I'm not really talking about analyzing the sound or something

414
00:42:49,720 --> 00:43:00,440
like that. This is just on the level of like awareness. But if you're what you're asking is,

415
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,720
so like if you're already affected, then first of all, if you're even if you're already affected,

416
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,240
then at least if you have the if you are aware enough at the at the point of that, like if you're

417
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:19,080
aware of like being insulted, that the mind that you're insulted, or that you that like this,

418
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:31,560
this feeling of of being insulted is there, then at least you can decide not to speak based on that.

419
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:39,560
So like at least then if you were aware of that point of being being insulted, then you can

420
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:46,440
decide not to speak based on that. But you have to be aware of like of what's going on in your mind

421
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:53,800
of the like feeling of being insulted that that is there in order to then practice restraint or not.

422
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,760
Okay. But you can also like, but if you like if you under first of there's many

423
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,040
there's different points. How do you not become affected in the in the furthest place? Like I

424
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:16,360
would say partly, partly is based on kind of developing understanding, like understanding of the

425
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:29,560
the I mean, this is more specific, but so why then would I need to ask myself, why then would I

426
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:36,440
need to ask myself who hears and who's offended and what did I hear and what sound and why why is

427
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:47,800
that relevant? No, but when I say like ask who hears, it's not it's not as a kind of question

428
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,840
that you kind of ask yourself or something to to analyze. It's just as a way of sort of pointing

429
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:59,320
to the place to be aware like to to. But what's the place? Not looking outside at the sound.

430
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:06,200
But why would that be relevant? So the sound did offend me. The sound was the problem.

431
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,080
No, the sound is not the problem. The sound is the sound. This is the point like if you.

432
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,040
Then it doesn't really matter. Like what I heard and who heard, it doesn't really, it's irrelevant.

433
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:24,200
What matters is I'm affected here and now doesn't matter why and who said what and to what extent.

434
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:31,240
I don't need to pay attention to the words even in that sense. So the problem is not in those things.

435
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,000
So how would you. So then how am I aware of where the problem is? Because when I ask you do this,

436
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,600
you describe the sound and the question and so on. I'm surely meant different, but doesn't matter.

437
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,960
The point is even if you say, oh, you don't really ask a question, you just look for the place.

438
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:56,360
Why? What place? Is it the place that I'm affected? It means, well, I am already affected. I already

439
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:01,560
know that. I don't need to look for the place. So what is the problem? Let me put it like that.

440
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:07,160
What is the problem in being affected? What is the problem in an insult? Is it the words?

441
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,720
Is it the person? Is it the attitude? Even is it my conceit? No, what is the problem there and then

442
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:23,240
while I'm insulted? What is the problem by being insulted? The fact is that you feel insulted

443
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:31,800
already. What is the problem of an insult? Sometimes a person can say something to you and you're

444
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,600
not insulted. Sometimes they say the same thing and now you're insulted. What's the difference between

445
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:46,280
the two? The difference is because example, you can hear the same insulting words from in a movie

446
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:55,320
example or in another context and now you will not get insulted because it's not because I'm not

447
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,680
insulted. The same context. Not relating to two different contexts which would be two different

448
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:07,800
experiences, the same experience, same context, same person, same occasion, same habit. Once I

449
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,280
feel insulted, another occasion I don't, which is quite possible. What would be the difference

450
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,480
between the two? It's not the words I hear. It's not even the mindset. I do recognize, look,

451
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:23,400
he wants to insult me like yesterday. So what would be the difference then between the two?

452
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:35,480
They want constitutes an issue. Exactly, pain, suffering, unpleasantness that you want to get rid

453
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,720
of. So you want to be mindful, you want to be aware, no need for sensations, no sound,

454
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:48,040
no self questioning of the psychological nature. All of that will be done inevitably in the beginning

455
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:53,640
but you need to maintain the sight like the eyes on the prize which is, no fundamentally,

456
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:00,680
the only reason insult, torture, anything is a problem is because emotionally it's uncomfortable

457
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:06,360
and I'm habitually resisting it. That's why I suffer. Not because of the words, not because who

458
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,960
hear the words, who is offended, it's because when the experience of disagreeable arises and

459
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,520
yours and this five aggregates, they're describing against it. And without the knowledge of that,

460
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,880
it will be impossible. A person will never arrive at it. It doesn't matter how much management,

461
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,760
how much meditation techniques and repostinars in the colloquial sense of what they do because

462
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:35,080
it's all revolves around being affected already and missing the point, which means for even to

463
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,880
the slightest degree, you miss that the point of insult is being unpleasant and you resist that,

464
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:46,440
to that extent you will, at least implicitly assume it's the words, it's the person, it's

465
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,640
something I've done, I wasn't mindful enough, I didn't do this, I didn't have my meditation,

466
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,280
I made all this, I will not do this mistake, all of that is secondary to the fact that no,

467
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,760
presence of craving means presence of suffering, not presence of unpleasant words, unpleasant

468
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:07,240
actions, unpleasant thoughts. So how would you be aware of that? You realize, oh, by recognizing

469
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:13,000
where the problem is. So mindfulness, knowledge, go hand in hand, you will not be able to be mindful

470
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,720
of these things unless you start discerning them and you will not be able to discern them,

471
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,680
unless you actually hear about them in that sense. That's why the two factors for the

472
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,880
arising of the right view is the right instruction and the right, the only someone in the car,

473
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,240
the proper type of like knowing what the attention is, so to speak. Because if you just hear my

474
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:39,000
actual words without a peripheral context of your own experience to which these words apply,

475
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,920
you have no yawning so basis. So you're just attending, literally taking word for word

476
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,400
in mantras and so on, like what people commonly do. All these are just said that, as I said this

477
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,200
and so on. I read the sutas, I study sutas, but peripherally, you want to discern the

478
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:00,040
context with this applies to you here and now this very moment, which is why this very moment,

479
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,400
the roots of suffering are being maintained by you. And that's exactly how you get even the

480
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,560
confidence that you're not even afraid of what you will hear in the future, what people will do

481
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:18,840
to you in the future, because the place where the pain is has been uprooted, which is the craving.

482
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,080
So it doesn't really matter what comes this way. The basis of suffering is gone, because suffering

483
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,800
was never in things that were coming through your ears, eyes and so on, not even through your thoughts,

484
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:35,800
so to speak. It was in your own ignorance of basic, your own attitude towards your own

485
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,960
presently enduring feeling here and now.

486
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:51,560
Yeah, at this point about, yeah, at this point of, if I can paraphrase generally,

487
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,120
yeah, that you suffer, but mainly what makes it suffering, what makes something suffering,

488
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,160
is because you, because of craving, like what makes anything suffering is because that you

489
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:07,320
like want to get rid of it or you want, or want something, you are already doing it.

490
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,600
It's not, I want to get rid of it. I am already trying to get rid of it. That's why I already

491
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:18,280
suffer. It's not on the level of choosing or not choosing. You're already, if you're already

492
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:25,960
suffering, if you're already affected, you're already getting rid of it. Yeah, and the point

493
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:33,160
where there was one point that you mentioned, there's like again, just again in regard to the

494
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:42,040
same example, like hearing, hearing insulting words, there's a, because there's, now you mentioned

495
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:47,720
unpleasant feeling arises, has arisen that you were trying to get rid of and this is what makes

496
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:59,000
this painful or suffering, if I got it right. But for somebody who's got rid of craving

497
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:11,640
and got rid of their self-centered point of view, let's say, how does the unpleasant feeling of

498
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:19,960
being insulted or right is? How can that be possible? The insult, the disagreeability of it,

499
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,360
but they're not resisting it. What's disagreeing about this? Well, the offensive attitude,

500
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,840
the threatening attitude of the person, perception of that, perception is disagreeable of it.

501
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,040
Like same when the Buddha said, sometimes a monk asking for instruction, he gives him

502
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,600
destruction and he goes and does the opposite. Buddha sees him doing the opposite, not being

503
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:45,720
restrained and he said, the target is disagreed with that. He experienced a disagreeable feeling,

504
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:50,120
but that disagreeable feeling cannot overwhelm his mind. In other words, there is no craving in

505
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,960
regard to disagreeability of that perception. It's not that this person who is free from

506
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,880
craving an other hand has no concept anymore of people's behavior or this is threatening,

507
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:07,640
this is agreeable, this is disagreeable. No, he cannot be affected by it, but agreeability

508
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,120
and disagreeability is still there. And that's the difference.

509
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,160
In the sense that, yes, like something is okay, it's

510
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,360
shouting you, I'm shouting, I'm punching my face, I'm threatening to hate you, I'm calling you names,

511
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,640
all of that is significant, you perceive that, you know what that means. Arran does not lose

512
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,720
the meaning of all these things, but he loses being emotionally overwhelmed by it.

513
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,960
Yeah, you can judge example the behavior that behaves, you can see, okay, if you start to

514
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,480
shout at me and to threaten me and every day, I can see, okay, it's actor out of anger, it's

515
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:55,720
immoral, it's immoral behavior, but why would it be disagreeable for me?

516
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,880
Like the example or hearing and insulting words is there's no reason for it to be disagreeable for

517
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:08,680
me? Well, there is no reason to not be disagreeable either, you are not in a choice of how things arise

518
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,840
for you, you just find things agreeing or disagreeing, cold, hot, that's why they would have compared

519
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:19,720
the words and abuse of others to should be endured like the way you endure the elements, you endure

520
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:26,840
instincts biting you. Yeah, so you trying why is that disagreeable is basically overstepping

521
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,720
into the domain of nature of perception and trying to why is it like that doesn't matter why.

522
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:38,120
Only the only thing you can know and you are responsible for is are you resisting the disagreeable?

523
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,520
Are you fearing it? Are you trying to get rid of it? Are you trying to prevent it out of fear and

524
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:47,320
so on? And are you trying to prolong the agreeable? Are you existentially dependent upon agreeable?

525
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,880
Why is there disagreeable and agreeable? It's basically like asking why the aggregate of

526
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,080
Sankara is there? Why the aggregate of perception is there? That's kind of a meaningless question

527
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,560
because the question is the result of the aggregate being there.

528
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:11,800
They are not sure because in regard to the like disagreeable things that arise from, because let's

529
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:25,000
say as let's talk about I mean a sound can be or like a sound can be something that like physically

530
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,160
hearing a sound can be sort of physically painful for the ear like I say a really loud sound.

531
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,600
So it's disagreeable? Physically disagreeable. You don't suffer you don't fear it but it's

532
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:44,760
disagreeable in itself. So asking why is it disagreeable it's like asking why is there a sound?

533
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:53,160
It's on the same footing. But what I was going to say is that the like disagreeable from from

534
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:58,520
hearing words is a bit different because that's not something physical. It's only on the level of

535
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:05,240
the how the mind how the mind takes it like if it's a because hearing you can hear the same words

536
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,760
based like as I said like you can hear it in itself. You can hear it in itself in a movie.

537
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,840
Right well it's not a word. So it's the context that you're still hearing if you don't hear the

538
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:23,880
movie the mind will have no context of impersonal insult. So whichever way your mind takes it

539
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:30,440
it did it boils down to the sound you heard. Again that's why the Buddha said he a skillful

540
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:36,680
man can do his heat called insect bites abuse of others and so on. It's on the level of elements

541
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:42,360
besetting you because there is meaning even in meaningless sound so to speak meaning to the point

542
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:49,000
of disagreeability. That's what it means screeching sound. Agreeability I don't it's nothing specific

543
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,960
there are no words to it but it's still in its very essence it suits or it disturbs that's it

544
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,920
and same with the speech. Obviously speech gets more elaborate because now there's all layers of

545
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:06,440
meaning of the words in the language and designations but fundamentally none of they would exist if

546
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:13,240
somebody didn't actually say it. If you didn't hear it so the sound is there still as a basis

547
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:19,720
and fundamentally doesn't matter how much how much it means positively or negatively what the

548
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:25,560
person said fundamentally it all remains bound with the sound that you heard the word so it's

549
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:36,040
agreeable or disagreeable fundamentally pleasing or displeasing but just the point I was trying

550
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,640
to make maybe maybe it doesn't matter but the but that the disagreeable is not in the sound it's

551
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:47,320
not because of the because of the nature of the sound it's only because of the nature of the meaning

552
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,720
if it's if it's about words that's where you're suffering. Yeah that's the difference between

553
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:57,240
suffering on account to disagreeable and disagreeable I'm talking about and the disagreeable I'm

554
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,600
talking about is in the sound that you heard that's that's as far as basically your responsibility goes.

555
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:09,240
You can now over analyze and say it's because they meant this or they meant that but fundamentally

556
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:17,560
none of that would be even there if you haven't heard it you would not be relevant it would be

557
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:32,680
like a movie you didn't watch. Yeah and it's quite important what I'm saying is because

558
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:41,160
if you do divorce agreeability and disagreeability from the perception through your senses it enables

559
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:47,800
you then to go through the analysis of the sound not in an abstract sense but like who where it came

560
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:52,920
from separate the meaning which kind of basically feels almost as if you are dealing with the problem

561
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,520
of it but you're not the problem is not that sound is agreeable or disagreeable or neither

562
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:05,800
maybe it's a neutral sound the problem is that agreeability disagreeability neutrality means basis

563
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:13,080
for craving for you within you but if you if you are focusing on the relationship between the sound

564
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:18,120
and disagreeability and why is it disagreeable or why it shouldn't be and the meaning and so on

565
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,920
means you're not dealing with the problem is so it doesn't matter why it's disagreeable what matters

566
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,160
is is they're craving against the disagreeable experiences a whole of somebody saying mean words

567
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:34,600
to me doesn't matter the individual syllables the words the exit none of that is relevant

568
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,480
who they are is irrelevant why did they say this why do they want to hurt me absolutely

569
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,720
relevant what really that is the experience as a whole is disagreeable and that's what I'm

570
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,920
resisting if I stop resisting the disagreeability the actual violence cannot harm me anymore

571
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:58,280
so how do you stop what do you mean by resist stopping to resist the disagreeable of it how

572
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,000
first see first you need to see exactly so if you think disagreeability is not in the perception

573
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:09,880
you have misconceived it if you think disagreeability is equals you're suffering you have misconceived

574
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,160
it so you need to see disagreeability of the experience as a whole as a reason phenomena

575
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:20,760
that you did not necessarily create and you have no say any directly but you are subjected to it

576
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,600
and that's why sensory strength needs to be done beforehand sensory strength that prevents

577
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:33,160
one's mind from blaming the sound or the person they said or attacking them implying they are

578
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:40,360
the cause for my suffering so you stop you start restraining then you still try to analyze the

579
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,920
disagreeable why did I say this why did I react like that maybe I shouldn't do it wasn't mindful

580
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,920
enough all of that revolves around the fact that you are resisting the disagreeable which means

581
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:55,880
you're not seeing it you're not seeing it for what it is enduring there but if you start actually if

582
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:01,960
you stop investing effort in managing the disagreeable and like no disagreeability is present doesn't

583
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:08,040
matter on account of what and then refrain for as long as it takes from jumping into the management

584
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,320
of the disagreeable then you get to see that all you have is disagreeable disagreeability or

585
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,880
agreeability and your attitude towards it that's the that's basically the core that's the only

586
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,920
relevance here that's the gateway for any suffering for any last for any version they will then be

587
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:30,680
manifested are you welcoming the agreeable are you resisting the disagreeable as a preemptive

588
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:36,440
attitude pretty much as a view and the only way you can see the view in regard to agreeability

589
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,520
or disagreeability is to first start seeing agreeability or disagreeability correctly

590
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,360
that's where the Buddha himself said all i'm teaching is suffering like correctly people don't

591
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:51,800
even know what suffering is all i'm teaching is dukkha and freedom from so i'm actually teaching

592
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:59,320
you dukkha like the Buddha would say means people like can suffer the utmost the greatest misfortune

593
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:05,560
and still completely have no idea what actual dukkha is so dukkha and freedom from dukkha

594
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:10,440
agreeability and freedom from agreeability disagreeability freedom from disagreeability

595
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,120
but it needs to be seen for what it is

596
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:29,160
because even when you have the view that but disagreeability doesn't feel like it's in the words

597
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:36,440
all of that you have pretty much developed inferred maintained on account of experiencing the disagreeable

598
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:42,440
words first and then your mind your thinking took you into explaining that it's not in the words

599
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:49,880
and so on because it was first and it remained first so does he doesn't matter as i said whether

600
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,840
it's in this this point is experiences a whole of certain words in this particular instance

601
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,800
felt disagreeable and it was a problem for me and that's why you gave into all these reflections

602
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,280
basically revolving around trying to together it trying to free yourself from it

603
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:12,360
yeah but i agree like this is not this is useless like to kind of analyze after the event is like

604
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:18,280
you're too late like that you already you already was disagreeable was already a problem and now

605
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,000
you say i was only because of the was only because it was only because of the meaning it was not because

606
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:30,920
of the words yeah oh that is useless um yeah this uh say agreed

607
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,560
and then um it's

608
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:52,040
like a bear related point what if

609
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,800
because we now we're talking about agreeable and disagreeable but in

610
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,760
and and like feeling feeling suffering on account of that but what i

611
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:11,160
like i would say that also like yeah you can talk about it on that level but i mean

612
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:18,520
there is the kind of additional problem let's say in getting angry about something is

613
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:25,320
one is that it's like one is that it's disagreeable but i think most people like as a normal person

614
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,720
when you get angry you don't even kind of notice that it's disagreeable because you're so focusing

615
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:36,360
on the object of it the anger itself you don't see it as disagreeable so i mean the problem with

616
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:43,080
anger is is is is more that it's in like on wholesome that it's wrong that it's that it's not

617
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,400
that it's not good but so like from that point of view

618
01:04:47,400 --> 01:05:04,440
but like you need to learn to you need to learn to not be it's not get angry in the first place okay

619
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:18,840
like if you kind of if you are getting if you are getting angry already

620
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:23,720
then like if you're getting angry and then kind of saying it's not if you if you allow yourself

621
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:29,960
to get angry and to continue to get angry and to speak out of anger like in your aim yeah your

622
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,640
aim can be to not get angry in the first place but i would say you kind of have to start by first

623
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:41,800
not allowing yourself to not not allowing the anger to continue well that's why i say you need

624
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:48,120
to start restraining yourself first you're not going to see things on the level of your mind if

625
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:52,680
you if your physical and verbal actions are not restrained beforehand so you have to stop acting

626
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:58,600
out of anger you have to stop acting out of lust with a goal of not being affected by it in the

627
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:06,360
first place so if you're still affected by the first place not acting well restrained but

628
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:12,600
affected in the first place you still have a massive problem there that's the route yeah

629
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:22,600
and it doesn't matter if you're getting affected as much or i'm not getting affected as much no

630
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:28,520
nature of being affected is something i'm still susceptible to thus it's still the massive problem

631
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,840
because often what happens when people get into practice they they start cultivating the environment

632
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:38,760
that suits them which is fine but then they begin they start to depend on that environment whereby

633
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,080
you you will have a protective environment well you might be the senior monk nobody will be

634
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:48,760
challenging you offending you questioning you nothing really to poke you around so you don't

635
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:54,360
really have this anger arising anymore because now you're basically to lower the land everybody's

636
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,760
your servant so to speak so but that doesn't mean you dealt with it so that's why the buddha

637
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,080
would say so you then ask yourself okay i'm not experiencing any kind of anger but

638
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:09,480
candy and a reason anger arise for me if you have no idea means yes you got your answer

639
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,920
so and that should be regarded as the root of the problem not the fact that most of my time

640
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:20,120
i'm not lastful most of my time i'm not angry that's because of the circumstances or because

641
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:25,160
you're in our hand which one is it so if person is honest they'll know the answer

642
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:31,320
but no often often it's regarded as oh dama helps me i don't get angry as much

643
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:36,360
are you still liable to anger yes that's not the dama that's just your management

644
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,360
on account of how you took dama to be to be but dama actually will approach it

645
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:52,520
it means you will be incapable of anger yeah they reminded me of that story with the mistress

646
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:58,440
vida hika i think another one the the maid servant the mistress was uh supposed to be so

647
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:17,560
patient and so kind and so she was testing her yeah so so i mean that's yeah that's

648
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,080
i mean i was uh it's it's like i said but it's a good point it's true like this i mean i was wondering

649
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:29,560
even um because i'm because i'm not involved and i don't i'm not or or none and like we don't

650
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:37,320
we don't live like that so um so it's kind of interesting kind of interesting way of practicing

651
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:46,280
here that you like you have kind of plenty of opportunity to see this to see that like anger

652
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:51,960
can arise or like the that these things can arise you're not in sort of a position where you

653
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:57,720
uh when you're never being confronted by anybody so in one sense i would say that's

654
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:02,440
almost a useful thing because you have to kind of be confronted by the by the fact that's

655
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:07,400
in a way exactly i think if it can be it can be beneficial for people but that's again that's

656
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:12,520
another place for peripheral awareness whichever whichever we want to call it would be handy

657
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:18,760
which would actually like result in knowledge if people's practice is about current sensations

658
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:23,880
in present moment present moment present moment presently i've no lost presently i've no ill will

659
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:29,160
that's it that's my concern present moment no future present moment should be a concern

660
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:35,320
on a reason last can it arise oh yeah that's another present moment that i'm obviously

661
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:40,360
ignoring because i'm so absorbed in present sensations and and present breathing and presently

662
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:45,880
being here and now you know judgment free or whatever else you know people say apologize

663
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:53,400
okay that's fine great so environment is suitable you made some effort are you liable to lust

664
01:09:53,400 --> 01:10:00,200
are you liable to aversion oh and if you are you are presently liable ironically enough

665
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:04,840
so you're so absorbed in the present moment that you don't see your present liability

666
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,320
to the very things you you think you're overcoming

667
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:14,920
and that's like see the possibility of future lust it's not present there so you cannot attend

668
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:20,040
to it that's exactly why people have people who are used to this kind of practice of just

669
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,360
just what's in front have problem understanding while you only summon a sicare is the way we describe

670
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:29,320
it have you know it cannot grasp peripheral because if the moment they think it they make it in the

671
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:35,240
front but it is there a possibility of future lust it's exactly that see it's an intention

672
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,920
that persists there because you're not free from lust arabhan has no possibility of future lust

673
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:48,920
no intentions of lust gone uprooted because he has made the effort on that on that right level

674
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:58,360
understood it okay but yeah this was a this was a point in the video yesterday that I

675
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:05,560
wanted to ask about anyway so like when you say the possibility of future like the yeah the

676
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:12,120
possibility of future lust or future sexual desire or future anger

677
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:22,040
like yeah it's it is there as a possibility and it is a problem which means it's a possibility

678
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:27,080
of future lust means its current liability and that's a problem

679
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:34,840
they basically means that you haven't uprooted this like as long as it's there because you

680
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:40,440
have not uprooted this yeah you haven't actually yeah you haven't fixed the problem so everything

681
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,880
else that's around you like oh most of the time I'm not angry most of the time I don't last fool

682
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,920
that's all circumstantial and should be regarded as such for as long as you don't approach it

683
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:55,240
that's the true freedom but many people by just focusing on what's in front what's in front is

684
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:00,920
that I don't get lustful don't get angry oh I must be free then or something but until you get

685
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:05,080
lustful or angry then you quickly deal with it and then you say well most of the time I'm fine

686
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:12,440
but if you're honest you would see being liable to it that's where the problem is rooted so am I

687
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:17,800
free from that or not if not means most of the time circumstances suit me and they don't challenge

688
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:25,560
me if that would change my mind would be overwhelmed by those things that I basically think I uprooted

689
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,800
and you don't want to wait for that to tell you to happen because it will be too late to deal with it

690
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:40,120
yeah I mean like yeah I see that it's like it's it's a useful it can be like a useful thing to like

691
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:47,480
ask yourself or to put this kind of pressure on yourself to see okay even if I'm not getting

692
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:52,120
angry right now I can get angry or if it's necessary it's not it's not optional it's complete it's

693
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:58,760
absolutely it's the only gateway towards writer-proofing everything else is management even if all you do

694
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:05,080
is read the suitors and practice unless it's done through this gateway of liability to Duka

695
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,960
one way or the other it's going to be on the level of management

696
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:22,280
okay but the question I had was about like why do you because I mean is Duka not present

697
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:31,640
anyway now in your current experience if you are like because it's it's present is it not present

698
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:36,440
anyway like why do you need to think about the liability for it in the future because that's

699
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:45,480
what Duka is Duka uneasiness this is that's what it is liability I mean the divine messenger the

700
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:53,160
Buddha wasn't sick wasn't old and wasn't dead but he recognizes inevitability so if he just focused

701
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:57,400
on whether it was present he wouldn't have seen those things as divine messages so you need even

702
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,840
wisdom to recognize where the problem is let alone to begin dealing with it

703
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:10,280
then the sense that yeah the fact that you're liable to suffering yeah the fact that you're

704
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:16,440
liable to suffering if you recognize the liability currently it's currently unpleasant so actually

705
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:22,040
Duka is present for everyone who's not free from it from that liability is just that it's not seen

706
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:28,040
hence the Buddha teaches Duka first and then freedom from it most people won't even see that

707
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:38,120
liability is a problem I mean yeah like pay when you pay attention to the idea that you are

708
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,120
that you're subject to suffering this isn't unpleasant or this can be this can be unpleasant

709
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:53,560
that is it just unpleasant but if you don't pay attention to the idea of the fact that

710
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:58,760
you can that you will suffer that you will get old that you will get sick that you will die

711
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,400
you don't pay attention to that then you don't feel that is suffering yeah that's where you need

712
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:08,760
to start paying attention to it because it is your reality it's unavoidable you can choose to not

713
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:13,960
pay attention to things that are avoidable but it's unwise thing to not pay attention to things that

714
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:19,480
are unavoidable the divine messages I mean yeah if you don't pay attention to side sound smell

715
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:24,200
taste touches they bother you they'll stop bothering you the fact is you can be bothered

716
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:29,320
and you will be bothered first so you choosing to not pay attention is you choosing to ignore the

717
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:37,000
problem I mean if you if you don't accept that you are ill you'll think you're healthy yeah

718
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:45,000
and that is pretty much the common world sort of way of dealing with a problem just ignore it just

719
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,800
ignore the problem it's not there don't pay attention to it absorb yourself either in the

720
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:54,920
australis or souls of feet or where the chair touches you or something don't pay attention to

721
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,840
your current liability of your existence because it's just too overwhelming

722
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:08,920
and what do you mean exactly by like paying attention it should I mean you have the idea that

723
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:15,800
I will suffer in the future okay so like then and I can remember you um inside of the video

724
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,040
yesterday like you don't need to keep you don't need to keep paying attention to the idea and

725
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:28,120
keep paying attention to that idea if if the mind is liable to like just ignore the problem

726
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:33,240
but once you become aware of the problem you start feeling that concern that dukkha

727
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,120
then you don't have to keep paying attention to it in the same sense of oh am I like because now

728
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:43,160
you feel it that you are liable and you already know so what you feel becomes pretty much the

729
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:48,920
exemplification of your knowledge of your situation and that's exactly what I said if a person does

730
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:56,520
feel dukkha correctly there are only two possible outcomes madness or noble search there is no

731
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:02,120
third possibility if dukkha is seen correctly mind will either go mad if he cannot deal with it

732
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:09,720
or if he has enough composure it will seek how do I approve this and most people never even allow

733
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,240
that choice to manifest even the ones they commit to the practice of dama and so on

734
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:19,560
it's all down on the level of management of the current disturbances not on the level of

735
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:35,480
uprooting my fundamental liability sickness aging death

736
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,720
so i'm just trying to um

737
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:03,400
like yeah so in the beginning you from from the beginning you need to recognize that you're

738
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:09,320
that that's yet that you that you need to recognize that yeah this is like to get the

739
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:17,080
to start practicing from the beginning with the right attitude it should be this like you have

740
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:22,360
to know that you are sick in order to see the doctor to like otherwise yeah if you if you don't

741
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,120
know that you are sick if you don't feel that you are sick you don't go to you don't go

742
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,120
don't go to see the doctor

743
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:35,160
um but like what is still not that clear for me is like the

744
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,160
uh

745
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,480
because then i mean they then you start to then you have to start to practice right so

746
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:55,880
like what i'm trying to understand what the practice is what is the what the practice is

747
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:02,600
is yeah well that's if you start living if you start living within the recognition of your

748
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,520
pretty much perpetual liability to do cut pray to suffering as everybody would say

749
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:13,400
and not give into like psychologizing managing trying to explain to yourself so you don't suffer

750
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:20,600
as much you will then abandon that which is basically liable to that to that suffering so

751
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:25,000
you would then and that's where this this all the other talks we did on the sense of ownership

752
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,280
and nature seeing correctly that's where it applies not on the level of explanation of the

753
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:34,600
world is often oh yes the modern science has said everything is impermanent the Buddha has said

754
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:41,000
see modern science and down my it's the same no first you need to feel that existential liability

755
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,080
and then recognize that on nature and then give up that because of which you suffer

756
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,520
give up your self-centeredness give up the dependence on pleasure all the upadhanas the Buddha talk

757
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:57,720
about but only on the basis of that framework of i am liable and this needs to be uprooted

758
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:04,280
because otherwise if you take it you don't take it on that basis sorry if you don't take it on that

759
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:08,600
basis it will be taken through the attitude of management of the disturbance of suffering

760
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:18,040
not the uprooting of the liability to it

761
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:27,800
yeah i mean like what i was talking about was more about the

762
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,640
and like i i like i agree like you're trying to just managing and not kind of

763
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:38,760
not have things that are disagreeable to you is uh like not to be not to

764
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:45,240
yeah not not to like suffer so much or not to it's it's no use i mean example that like you will

765
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:49,800
always just try to get away from the things that are disagreeable but you won't like uh you won't

766
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:55,480
try to remove the things that are agreeable so the management of restoring to is not it's not necessarily

767
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:01,720
it's not like a choice or people choose i will manage it's basically the yeah the the default

768
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:08,680
result if you are not operating within the recognition of liability to suffering

769
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:14,120
if you are not operating within framework of that existential anxiety you are managing your

770
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:20,920
suffering even unknowingly things you do will be on the level of management not uprooting it because

771
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,480
you have well either have no recognition or have fallen from the recognition of that general

772
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:35,000
anxious nature of your situation duka anise disease not duka or is bothering me that's all

773
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:50,760
secondary to it yeah yeah yeah because i mean duka is if it's only when something is bothering

774
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:56,440
you then it's very easy you can just try to find the you people it's not it's not really it's

775
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:01,720
the problem the problem is not that people haven't heard enough of dama or haven't read enough of

776
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:08,440
the suitors the problem is that pretty much none of them like all the people they practice but without

777
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:14,040
actual becoming arhans and so on means something's wrong there and it's not that there was lack of

778
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:19,000
teachings or lack of suitors or Buddhist instruction or that it's not clear enough is that they never

779
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,880
ever heard or learned on what level it needs to be applied and it was always stayed within the

780
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:31,320
framework of management unknowingly so that's what i mean you have to stay within that recognition

781
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:36,680
of that liability prey to suffering which is pretty much the framework of anxiety

782
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:43,720
so that's why people would go mad if they stay on that level and often would like or quickly

783
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,680
manage it because yeah they don't know any other way so you need to censor strain virtue is what

784
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:59,640
will prevent you from going mental okay so there's two things now you've said here you said that

785
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:05,720
censor straight and like morality is what prevents you from going mental and you said there's

786
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,680
he will prevent you going mad on account of anxiety he will not approve the anxiety

787
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,080
yeah then you can approve the eventually

788
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:31,000
yeah and to put in like basically from from if i if i understand well like if you if you

789
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,880
to practice correctly if you want if you practice directly and then you have to be always practicing

790
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:45,000
with a view basically to the aim of of getting out of suffering yeah like this has to be the aim

791
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:54,440
caught looking the liability yeah like this this is what i this is what i understand like that you

792
01:23:54,440 --> 01:24:02,680
have to like this is your the aim should be always at every moment and it's not exactly but it's not

793
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:08,200
it's not an abstract aim in a sense it's not like oh i must keep this thought in my mind it's it's

794
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:16,360
the anxious aim it's the aim you feel anxiety remains there liable to it the aim is there outlined

795
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:21,080
you don't need to think it anymore in that sense what's my aim what is my aim but unless you have

796
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:26,760
uncovered the liability of that's anxious in its nature then you have to drill and drill until you

797
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:40,760
learn what dukkha is first yeah so they first like well about like making this aim clear and then

798
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:45,880
taking your actions in order to bring taking every action or taking every practice in order to bring

799
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:56,040
your closer to this aim this is correct this is i clear about um then feeling like do you mean that

800
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:03,080
you should have to feel anxious constantly in practicing or no what you don't have to be like

801
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:08,440
uh sort of trying to contrive anxiety but if you're thinking correctly you will feel uneasy to what

802
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,160
extent that uneasiness will be a threatening anxiety and fear or not depends to what extent

803
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:18,760
you've basically developed your seal and are able to hold it but the recognition of the peril is

804
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:25,160
is the i mean part of understanding the danger is part of freeing yourself from sensuality from the

805
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:31,240
world from the aggregates from everything so the danger is still there i don't see it but yes

806
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:37,880
how dangerous that danger is for you it's basically how how much you have understood it or not but

807
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:43,400
it's still the same danger so initially it's probably going to be very frightening and very anxious

808
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:51,080
but if you don't act out of it don't break the sealer sensory strength and that strength that

809
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:57,800
you've accumulated through basic controlling your output your behavior then you can actually well

810
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:03,000
you you will be able like anxiety is a problem when it's threatening when you when there is a risk

811
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:10,600
of being overwhelmed by it if you have sustained it long enough if there is less and less risk for

812
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:16,440
that danger to overwhelm you but you and then you get to see it even clearer ah the peril the danger

813
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:22,200
becomes apparent and when the danger is apparent you have abandoned any passion towards that which

814
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:27,800
is dangerous so that means completely not abstract or on the level of

815
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:34,840
theories of figuring it out it's actually felt the danger is felt first and then you not being

816
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:40,280
liable to that same danger is also felt which is when ah the danger becomes apparent thus the

817
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:49,160
freedom becomes apparent from it so how much you're going to feel anxiety and when in what

818
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:55,640
process depends pretty much on how much samadhi who have developed how well your virtue has been

819
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:01,400
established and how intense is your current recognition of samadhi or sorry of anxiety of

820
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:08,040
liability to suffering sometimes will be more something will tell you have good days bad days

821
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:13,000
but that is that is the the field where you have to do the work it's not optional that's what i'm

822
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,960
saying how much you're going to suffer or come with this option that's what i said sometimes

823
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:24,200
for some monks practice is pleasant with pleasant results painful with pleasant results and so on

824
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:29,400
but it's the same thing it's not like oh i have this approach or that approach it's just

825
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:35,240
some minds are stronger they will suffer less on account of the threat because they have more

826
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:41,960
composure samadhi some minds are not that strong so they'll suffer more that's what exactly put the

827
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:48,200
who who practiced through the persona not samadhi as much his way was unpleasant and long

828
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,720
but then yeah he was the second to the Buddha in terms of the foremost wisdom

829
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:01,000
but if you start actually practicing rightly even the unpleasant way you will recognize

830
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:07,240
the liberating aspect of it so you will have no problem in basically enduring that anxiety and

831
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:14,280
doesn't matter how big it gets and how threatened it is but in order to get there you need to start

832
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:19,320
rightly and that will be hard for somebody who hasn't been practicing on that level

833
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:32,680
so be just if i so i don't understand well what you're saying you say there's you have to like

834
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:39,640
you have to feel anxious feel anxiety feel suffering feel the suffering in the sense that you

835
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:47,640
are that you do over like in a that you have no control over your over your life and that you will

836
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,240
get old and that you will get sick and that you will die no matter what you do and all of this

837
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:58,360
um so you have to start like start from this point in order to have like the in order to like

838
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:05,400
keep the have the aim and then keep the aim of keep the right context as a basis yeah for the

839
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:12,120
correct direction if you practice yeah and that's what i mean that's why people don't keep that

840
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:17,320
right context not because they choose something it's because they don't want to feel that discomfort

841
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,720
it's not an abstract course that they make or some like a little mistake because they

842
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:33,560
didn't have enough information no it's existentially avoiding the recognition that you are within the

843
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:40,600
perilous situation without any means of escape and that's very frightening that's essentially fear

844
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,800
of death in the nacho all the people are not necessarily even my colleague that way you'll be

845
01:29:45,800 --> 01:30:13,240
aware of it it cut out there at for um for a moment um can you hear me now sure oops okay okay um

846
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:21,160
so yeah so just cut there a little bit the last part i heard was um that you were saying how when

847
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:26,760
people like start by the wrong on the wrong start on the wrong footing essentially or they don't

848
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:33,480
practice rightly it's because of um basically because of ignoring ignoring this fact there's

849
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,880
ignore yeah ignoring your which means you can always fix it nor you can always fix your footing

850
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:43,640
at any given time you can always fix that you can always restart and reestablish the right framework

851
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:49,080
but the thing is the more you give in to ignoring it because it's fundamentally frightening and

852
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:54,680
unpleasant the more you drift away and more incapable of accepting it you are because the

853
01:30:54,680 --> 01:31:00,680
more the more effort in trying to outrun it you invested so theoretically anybody can become

854
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:08,280
an Idaho at any stage of life but practically if you spend 20 30 years more avoid in this and even

855
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:14,360
practicing while avoiding it it would be virtually impossible for you after all that invested effort

856
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:18,920
to basically just wipe your slate clean and re-accept that fundamental liability that will

857
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:23,720
fill you with anxiety and make you like back onto the day one i mean people won't do that in for

858
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:29,640
mundane things let alone for something so profound and hard to approach such as you know existential

859
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:43,000
anxiety yeah i mean that's why i mean i think most people they don't really practice with the

860
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:48,280
with the for that for the aim of the of the of the goal really they don't

861
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:54,840
but they don't be practiced for another reason or for like wanting to like basically wanting to

862
01:31:54,840 --> 01:32:01,640
feel better or to and there is no if they don't practice with that as a basis the right basis

863
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:06,920
they don't practice dama even if it's the dama they're doing i mean the buddha said himself only yeah

864
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:12,920
like he he's teaching has only one taste like the ocean has only one taste of salt taste the

865
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:19,240
freedom from suffering nothing else so suffering freedom from it is the only place where dama can be

866
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:24,120
so i mean it's an option not it's not oh let me choose this or choose that

867
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:34,760
it's the only way um

868
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:44,120
there was maybe just one more i i'm i'm aware of taking up a lot of your your time already um

869
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:54,200
um and i would just like to maybe to ask on one more one more point

870
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:10,120
a bit or two so like if i can kind of summarize basically the like overall the the different

871
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:18,600
points that are mentioned um so from the beginning you have to start like with uh

872
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:24,280
recognizing that you're sick like the recognizing that you you're what the nature of your problem is

873
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:30,120
and then you have to like make the aim clear a bit like if you're not practicing with the

874
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:35,080
realization that you're sick and like we needing to be healed then you're not practicing right

875
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:40,680
you have to resist the temptation to not to manage the symptoms at the expense of the recognition

876
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:45,800
of your illness that's still there even if you remove the symptoms yeah but am i still alive yeah

877
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:53,000
thus i'm still ill so don't get complacent even when things don't bother you and suddenly don't

878
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:01,080
make your practice revolve around dealing with things that bother you only yeah yeah so i mean

879
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:06,680
don't look just for a painkiller basically like you want to go to the you you want to go to see

880
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:11,960
that go to a doctor yeah if the pain is too much take the painkiller but don't forget that

881
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,800
fundamentally the only reason you needed to take the painkiller and the head pain is because

882
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:22,520
you're still sick there's still the underlying illness yeah yeah and as long as you haven't cured

883
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:28,200
the underlying illness then actually you can you can continue to take painkillers but the illness

884
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,960
is still there and it's getting worse exactly and now you don't even have the symptoms to tell you

885
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:40,120
how worse it is yeah yeah exactly so it's a it's a big problem i agree like

886
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:46,520
because you can feel so kind like you can you can make yourself feel very calm by just like

887
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:50,760
concentrating on the breath or something like that and you can spend hours a day just concentrating on

888
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:55,720
sensation of breathing and now you feel so much better and you think everything's going so much

889
01:34:55,720 --> 01:35:00,920
better is you think you're fine so now you stop like searching for a way out because you think

890
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:06,200
you're fine yeah that's that's what i said in other talks like most of like today's meditation

891
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,280
Buddhist meditation practice is just calming techniques which is fine if you need to calm down

892
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:15,240
but don't confuse that for samadhi there will result in panya and complete wisdom and liberation

893
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:27,880
yeah and then like the other point is then about like what what is the like once you once you know

894
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:32,520
what you're what you're doing then what does the practice consist of at one point you said morality

895
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:41,320
is to stop yourself from going mad um i don't know if i have seen this uh

896
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:49,640
uh like i think morality is essential like it's a essential base of of practicing morality is

897
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:55,720
in the sense of like no not having any wrongdoing in in thoughts words or actions

898
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:10,760
and then new payer what you were what you were talking about what you were saying is that

899
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:18,440
basically you um you need to kind of realize that's the problem like understand where the problem is

900
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:26,600
in the sense that you that you can become affected by anger or that you can become that you become

901
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:35,240
greedy or that you are that you are or having desire for things in the first place and not to

902
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:42,760
just like want to kind of manage these things when they arise so this point is okay um

903
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:53,960
and yeah so then the and then the correct practice like to what yeah what what kind of

904
01:36:53,960 --> 01:37:01,960
still is like i'm kind of trying to figure it out is the if you're if you're practicing

905
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:08,040
rightly like if you if you if you practice if you if you practice correctly

906
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:14,280
then you should see that you're practicing correctly right so there's no need to have the

907
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:20,600
same anxiety of uh that was there in the beginning if you know that you're practicing rightly yeah

908
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:25,800
if you're not so see you're not ignoring your liability to suffer you're not ignoring the

909
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,120
peril you're not turning a blind eye you're not distracting yourself from it and it doesn't

910
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:36,440
bother you as much now because you pretend it's not there because you get used to it

911
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,200
anxiety will stop bothering you when you get used to it

912
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:46,600
when you are able to maintain composure in the face of it and the only way to do that is to

913
01:37:46,600 --> 01:38:02,440
train composure in the face of anxiety and to come back just to just come back to the beginning

914
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:07,560
about the because you were telling the base of like the base of being able to practice

915
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:14,440
mindfulness correctly is to have the the right kind of awareness to be able to

916
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:21,960
uh have awareness correctly which um is not about just uh like paying attention to sensation

917
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:27,960
or paying attention to sound or paying attention to something else nor is it about like analyzing

918
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:40,520
your thoughts or analyzing your uh like experience and so now you were um so now you said the periphery

919
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:48,760
meaning the like what you said was the basis for that for on which you're paying attention

920
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:53,160
periphery means the background the background of whatever is currently attended in there so

921
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:59,640
the the mind is the background in itself the intentionality the possibilities as we described

922
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:03,800
that's already the background in itself so it's that's that's what peripheral is

923
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:11,560
okay it's it can sound technical and i think in those years we use it for the sake of the context

924
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:17,800
but it's really the background of your currently engaged experience that you don't want to make

925
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:24,920
into a foreground because then again the point is not what is the foreground or what is the

926
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:30,120
background the point is to be aware of the background while there is whatever action

927
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:35,720
intention presently and during feeling and so on in the foreground and that background is literally

928
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:41,560
the knowledge of that situation nothing else no sensations no nothing specific that's why it's

929
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:47,960
so hard to see because it's nonspecific and what else is nonspecific what the nature of things is

930
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:57,560
nonspecific the nature of this specific cup the nature of this specific object is nonspecific

931
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:02,280
from the point of view of the specific object to which that object kind of pertains to

932
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:08,600
and that's that's in essence done the nature of things so it's always found in that background

933
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:09,560
where the knowledge is

934
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:19,960
so that's what i mean oh specifically there is a

935
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:26,440
not where the knowledge is yeah where the knowledge is yeah specifically there is an insult

936
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:34,200
an angry voice everything all of that is quite specific not specifically there is a presence

937
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:40,040
of suffering that i'm resisting nonspecifically there is discomfort there are many different

938
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:46,040
nonspecific ways you can take but it will be the same nature of this experience so fundamentally

939
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:51,000
the problem here is not what's being said what's being heard not even what's being felt yeah the

940
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:57,480
problem is that within this basically experience the whole i'm resisting it and i have a view

941
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:02,520
that i should not suffer that i'm in control and i should not suffer that's all implicit

942
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:09,640
so that's the nature of that experience that is the background that is the the vessel in which you

943
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:16,280
and that's where you get you get insulted when you hear something immediately because the framework

944
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:22,840
ready for insult is already there in other words framework ready to resist any form of discomfort

945
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:52,680
that comes through the senses is already there currently maintained by you
