00:00.000 --> 00:25.440
So this is a sutta maybe for monks really, a discussion for monks, maybe they would understand

00:25.440 --> 00:35.240
it a bit more. But in any case it's called one in training. So the Buddha says, monks

00:35.240 --> 00:45.120
of this recitation of more than 150 training wars, he means patimoka, comes up every fortnight

00:45.120 --> 00:52.600
in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train themselves. They are

00:52.600 --> 00:58.800
these three trainings under which all that is gathered, which the training in heightened

00:58.800 --> 01:04.200
virtue, the training in heightened mind and the training in heightened discernment. These

01:04.200 --> 01:11.920
are the three trainings under which all that is gathered. So there is a case where a monk

01:11.920 --> 01:23.200
is fully accomplished in virtue, moderately accomplished in samadhi and moderately accomplished

01:23.200 --> 01:30.760
in discernment. With reference to the lesser and minor training wars, he falls into offences

01:30.760 --> 01:41.880
and rehabilitates himself, he confesses them and says, why is that? Because I, so why is

01:41.880 --> 01:47.880
that? Because I have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances,

01:47.880 --> 01:54.840
meaning being holy accomplished in virtue, doesn't disqualise that yet. But as for

01:54.840 --> 02:00.520
the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life, he is one

02:00.520 --> 02:06.600
of permanent virtue, one of steadfast virtue. Having undertaken him, he trains in reference

02:06.600 --> 02:11.760
to the training rules. And with the ending of the first three fetters, he is a stream

02:11.760 --> 02:17.200
winner, a sotopanna, never again destined for the states of woe, certain, headed for

02:17.200 --> 02:21.560
self-awaking. And it goes on through that through the different levels of attainment

02:21.560 --> 02:26.720
all the way up to Arahantsha. On the basis of that, fully accomplished in virtue, fully

02:26.720 --> 02:39.400
accomplished in the same sense that the mountain stream would fill out the bottom pools, they

02:39.400 --> 02:43.160
would overfill and fill up the bottom pools. And eventually even the sea would be filled

02:43.160 --> 02:49.400
up. And at the end of that sutta, he says, those who are partially accomplished attain

02:49.400 --> 02:57.160
the path, those who are fully accomplished attain the full thing. The training rules

02:57.160 --> 03:05.800
I tell you are not in vain. And that's the important part. The rules that are essence

03:05.800 --> 03:12.360
of the training are basically the eight precepts. Whenever the guru will talk about the wise

03:12.360 --> 03:16.760
man of the past, the virtuous people of the past, it's the eight precepts of these principles

03:16.760 --> 03:22.760
that you can have many other rules in the monastic manner, many other rules, but they're

03:22.760 --> 03:27.080
all kind of within that. The one, the rules, the matter. Then you have the circumstantial

03:27.080 --> 03:32.160
social rules and so on minor rules. But the ones that matter for the training are basically

03:32.160 --> 03:38.760
the ones that are around lust, aversion, distraction, and delusion. That's it. So yes, that's meant

03:38.760 --> 03:43.040
for monks, but actually even the late person, if they become accomplished in eight precepts,

03:43.040 --> 03:49.920
they can expect the same. Heightened mind and heightened discernment. Many lay people

03:49.920 --> 03:55.040
in the sutta were Anagamis, they were teaching monks, the new monks, because they were so

03:55.040 --> 04:00.960
developed. So what is that development? Is it the technical

04:00.960 --> 04:10.160
letter of the rule, prescribed by the contemporary tradition? Where is it? So what is that accomplishment?

04:10.160 --> 04:14.440
What does it make accomplished? Is it knowing the letter of every rule and looking for

04:14.440 --> 04:19.960
every technicality or knowing the state of mind and intention behind directions, which

04:19.960 --> 04:26.200
is closer? So whenever people are latching onto technicalities and the letter of the

04:26.200 --> 04:33.280
rules, it's when the intention for the state of mind is either obscured, not taking responsibility

04:33.280 --> 04:40.400
for or blatantly just to be avoided. So you don't feel responsible, because this is the

04:40.400 --> 04:45.440
tradition that I follow, this is the rules that I follow, this is the letter that I follow,

04:45.440 --> 04:50.080
and I don't think, I don't need to think for myself. And because of that, you can follow

04:50.080 --> 04:56.080
such rules in such manner for hundreds of years, have like the full ordination, the

04:56.080 --> 05:01.920
highest approval, and still not be accomplished in virtue. And that's exactly what Cilabhar

05:01.920 --> 05:10.480
Paramah says, taking on virtue as a sense of external duty, for which you're not allowing

05:10.480 --> 05:17.280
yourself to feel responsible for internally. And why would a person not allow themselves

05:17.280 --> 05:20.960
to feel responsible for that? Because the moment you become responsible, you become liable

05:20.960 --> 05:28.320
to doubt. So that's exactly why Cilabhar Paramahasa is bundled with a factor of doubt. If you actually

05:28.320 --> 05:34.560
manage to break yourself away from the dependence on the external letter and take responsibility

05:34.560 --> 05:41.160
for the virtue, you will creating a basis for overcoming the factor of doubt. But if you

05:41.160 --> 05:46.160
don't allow yourself to step away from it in that correct sense, in that correct direction,

05:46.160 --> 05:51.480
you will never overcome doubt. Because the reason why the duty is imposed by yourself

05:51.480 --> 05:57.960
to yourself is so the doubt cannot arise. And you often see that when a mind that's dependent

05:57.960 --> 06:03.080
on the letter, somebody points out that their letter might be wrong, they're overwhelmed.

06:03.080 --> 06:09.000
I mean, we witness it many times. Overwhelmed with the existential doubt, because they realize

06:09.000 --> 06:12.800
everything leading up to that was based on that letter saying what it says, so I didn't

06:12.800 --> 06:17.800
feel responsible for it. Yet now somebody just questions that. They don't even prove

06:17.800 --> 06:24.560
that the letter of your rule is wrong. They just start questioning and you are shaking.

06:24.560 --> 06:30.040
And if that doesn't concern you means you lack even basic authenticity, basic self-awareness.

06:30.040 --> 06:37.400
And that's why there is no right view for you. So you need to understand that that yes,

06:37.400 --> 06:43.600
you learn the letter of the rules, but depending how far you're going to go into the letter

06:43.600 --> 06:48.280
of the rules and why. Is it because I'm not really still understanding the rule? Sure,

06:48.280 --> 06:52.920
go further. Is it? No, I understand the rule, but I want more technicalities to prevent

06:52.920 --> 06:58.600
me from myself and from my own mind. Oh, you want to avoid the practice? Because that's

06:58.600 --> 07:04.000
where Samad is as we said before. Things that want to overwhelm the mind, the monk doesn't

07:04.000 --> 07:09.840
let the mind being overwhelmed. That's his practice of Samadhi. So you understood the

07:09.840 --> 07:13.600
rule, you understand the eight precepts, you understand the ten precepts, you understand

07:13.600 --> 07:22.080
150 training rules. If you're not clear about some rule, you clarify it. That's it. Now,

07:22.080 --> 07:28.600
you practice. You practice in a way by keep making sure when you're about to act, you

07:28.600 --> 07:32.240
act according with those rules or you have the calling with an ingredient on a version

07:32.240 --> 07:37.880
on delusion. If you break it, you see where you broke it, you see why you broke it, and

07:37.880 --> 07:41.120
you don't need to depend on technicality because you're always aware of your intention

07:41.120 --> 07:45.960
behind the actions. And then if somebody points out technicality allows you this, but it's

07:45.960 --> 07:50.500
like it doesn't. The state of mind doesn't allow you to do that. So if you actually

07:50.500 --> 07:55.800
stop looking, if you start looking at the context of the rules, eight precepts, 150

07:55.800 --> 08:00.560
precepts, and maintain the context of the rules in your mind, there will be no loopholes

08:00.560 --> 08:06.160
for you, and there will be no need for the loopholes. If you start looking at the letter

08:06.160 --> 08:11.000
that gets proliferated more and more and more into this definition of a sub definition

08:11.000 --> 08:18.280
of a sub definition, then all of it, it will be about loopholes. It will be about things

08:18.280 --> 08:23.360
that are left not addressed, and you know they come under the same context, but you

08:23.360 --> 08:28.280
have drifted away from that context so much now into these particulars that you lost

08:28.280 --> 08:34.080
the sight of the forest pretty much. And that's exactly when people and monks become

08:34.080 --> 08:37.720
technical. Well technically I'm not breaking the rule and stuff. It's like, what is the

08:37.720 --> 08:44.180
state of mind behind that action? You are breaking the virtue and the story. There is

08:44.180 --> 08:50.440
no accomplishment in virtue unless you take the virtue on that level of the mind. But

08:50.440 --> 08:54.840
people confuse learning about the rules, learning about technicalities for keeping the rules

08:54.840 --> 08:59.000
and keeping the technicalities. In other words, they feel justified in not taking it personally,

08:59.000 --> 09:03.600
in not taking responsibility for it, but projecting and keeping responsibility on the level of

09:03.600 --> 09:08.240
well that's the tradition, that's the authority, that's how it's been for hundreds of years,

09:08.240 --> 09:14.040
doesn't matter. You can choose to accept the tradition, the traditional rules, the traditions,

09:14.040 --> 09:19.080
the standards, that's all fine. But even if you do so, you still have to recognize that

09:19.080 --> 09:23.000
you're responsible for that. You're responsible for either choosing to interpret things for

09:23.000 --> 09:27.120
yourself, for either choosing to follow this commentary, for either choosing to follow

09:27.120 --> 09:31.200
someone else's interpretation or someone else's tradition, it's on you. Nothing justifies

09:31.200 --> 09:39.040
you in choosing that. So in other words, you need to recognize that whether you understand

09:39.040 --> 09:43.320
it for yourself directly or whether you follow someone else's interpretation, you need to

09:43.320 --> 09:49.880
know why you are doing it. That needs to be clear to you. So if I ask you, oh, do you

09:49.880 --> 09:54.240
give you a pre-set, yes. Well, the fifth pre-set, what's your standard on it? How do you understand

09:54.240 --> 09:57.160
such and such circumstance? And you tell me, well, I follow the tradition of such and

09:57.160 --> 10:03.800
such teacher. I, as a dog, that's fine. Why? You should be able to tell me, why do you

10:03.800 --> 10:10.840
follow that? In other words, how is that way of like following that particular interpretation

10:10.840 --> 10:16.600
or the rule or take on the rule? How is that feeding your accomplishment in virtue directly?

10:16.600 --> 10:21.400
How is that connected to it? You can't just say, I follow because he's a great teacher.

10:21.400 --> 10:26.040
Well, yeah, but what is the benefit of following that? Do you see that for yourself? Or you're

10:26.040 --> 10:31.720
just going by mere reputation and mere tradition and hearsay, which is, you know, the Buddha

10:31.720 --> 10:38.480
said many times something you shouldn't really do, unless you're very unwise. So be a follow,

10:38.480 --> 10:43.360
you know, clarify whatever else, but never feel justified on just, oh, well, I belong

10:43.360 --> 10:46.800
to this great tradition now. And these are our standards. And that's the end of the game

10:46.800 --> 10:53.840
there. No. Why? Why do I keep these standards? Do I keep them authentically, individually,

10:53.840 --> 10:58.120
personally, internally? In which case, I don't need the tradition in the standards because

10:58.120 --> 11:02.640
it's kept on this level, not on the level of traditional behavior. And that's how exactly

11:02.640 --> 11:07.520
what we're saying. If you actually accomplish yourself on that level in that virtue, where

11:07.520 --> 11:12.720
you're not shying away from doubt by willing to endure it, clarifying the context, maintaining

11:12.720 --> 11:16.840
the context, not proliferating the rule to prevent you from having doubt arise in your

11:16.840 --> 11:21.000
mind again. Well, I will never do that again. Well, but it wasn't an offense. It was not

11:21.000 --> 11:25.400
an issue. It wasn't even rooted in greed aversion delusion. But why am I doubting it?

11:25.400 --> 11:29.400
Because that's what doubt is it's an irrational mind, a hindrance that tries to throw your

11:29.400 --> 11:34.560
way, tries to make you act out of it. And here you are acting out of it. Because now

11:34.560 --> 11:37.960
you're redefining and making new rules. So you will never do stuff that you know was

11:37.960 --> 11:42.360
nothing wrong with just because you doubted and account of it. And you never you don't

11:42.360 --> 11:46.960
know how to deal with the doubt. So by taking the taking the virtue wrongly, you will not

11:46.960 --> 11:50.160
be able to deal with the doubt because of which you keep taking the virtue wrongly because

11:50.160 --> 11:54.640
of which you can't deal with the doubt. And no samadhi, exactly, absolutely no samadhi

11:54.640 --> 11:59.280
because there is no accomplishment. If you take the virtue rightly and do it without

11:59.280 --> 12:04.600
don't act out of the doubt. Sustain the context of the virtue. No, because you know, you know

12:04.600 --> 12:08.920
what it is, but the mind pressures you to find out more, look into technique, create

12:08.920 --> 12:14.560
this, create that act, left, left, right, avoid, prevent. If you sustain that and not

12:14.560 --> 12:18.040
act out of it, you will become accomplished in the virtue. And basically, how did you

12:18.040 --> 12:22.080
do that? Oh, that's already the practice of samadhi. Not moving in regard to the mind

12:22.080 --> 12:26.840
they want to move you. And that's what the Buddha said is just if somebody's accomplished,

12:26.840 --> 12:31.720
at least in that basis, three factors will have to be destroyed. You cannot not be a

12:31.720 --> 12:37.720
sautapana if you have taken virtue in that level and endured it. But you will certainly

12:37.720 --> 12:41.640
not be a sautapana if you've taken virtue in the level of the external letter of the

12:41.640 --> 12:46.440
law, the rule, the tradition, the authority, the agenda, the senior monk, whatever else.

12:46.440 --> 12:51.000
Even if they were right, by the way, in the standards that they laid upon you, if you

12:51.000 --> 12:55.600
took it externally, there is no basis for your virtue to actually take place.

12:55.600 --> 13:03.720
So the first preset of not harming, not killing, a living being, why do you keep that? Why

13:03.720 --> 13:08.640
is that wrong? And if you don't know why, you cannot be accomplished. It's just kind

13:08.640 --> 13:15.400
of circumstantially taking that external rule. You learn them circumstantially. You investigate

13:15.400 --> 13:19.600
them in circumstantially. But once you start keeping them, no, you need to know for yourself.

13:19.600 --> 13:25.240
Like this needs to be seen personally. Like why this is not done? Why it's not good to

13:25.240 --> 13:30.440
do this? So that's the thing. So you see what is unwholesome, what is wholesome. That is

13:30.440 --> 13:34.040
your discernment. Well, we clear that is that's what you're going to start seeing. You're

13:34.040 --> 13:36.880
going to start seeing wholesome is wholesome and wholesome is unwholesome because you're

13:36.880 --> 13:41.000
seeing the root of that, which makes it unwholesome, what makes it wholesome. But you will not

13:41.000 --> 13:45.800
see that if you just block it and say, Well, this is our tradition. This is my culture.

13:45.800 --> 13:51.200
This is what a Buddhist person does. Well, okay. And that's that's literally applicable

13:51.200 --> 13:57.120
to every other religion. That level of I am such and such identify with every religion

13:57.120 --> 14:02.720
without observance without rule. I keep it. No questions asked. Because it makes you

14:02.720 --> 14:05.680
safe. Well, exactly. Yeah, because we're all questioning means you don't want to keep

14:05.680 --> 14:11.720
it. No question. It means I want to know what I keep. There's no there's no justification

14:11.720 --> 14:17.160
for you assuming cynical reasons for my questioning. Unless it's your own cynical mind putting

14:17.160 --> 14:23.760
that over there. No, I want to understand what I keep. But for many people, even questioning

14:23.760 --> 14:28.200
to understand what will make you like, do I need to keep this? Do I want to keep this?

14:28.200 --> 14:32.200
Do I want to be a monk? Do I want to practice? And that's something also that it makes you

14:32.200 --> 14:36.760
unpleasant, makes you doubtful. So you refuse to think about it, you refuse to question,

14:36.760 --> 14:40.920
you just double down. This is my duty. This is the tradition and you double down on your

14:40.920 --> 14:46.120
own syllabata paramas. The very first fetter because of which, as I said, you can keep

14:46.120 --> 14:51.520
the eight precepts for hundreds years and absolutely have no samadhi and wisdom arising

14:51.520 --> 14:59.240
from it. If you look at the beginning of the monastic order, there were no rules. No,

14:59.240 --> 15:03.480
of course. And why? Don't it was clear? Yeah. It was not obscured. People knew exactly

15:03.480 --> 15:08.080
what behaviors were in line with it and what behaviors weren't. Yeah. So and that basic

15:08.080 --> 15:15.120
you can boil it down to don't do anything. Unholesome. No way. Unholesome. Don't do

15:15.120 --> 15:19.840
it. And that's why also as the things sort of progressed back in the Buddhist time, that

15:19.840 --> 15:25.640
whole need for like, you know, a new monk would have to spend like five years training

15:25.640 --> 15:32.080
with senior monk, somebody that they'd accepted him. Because yes, an untrained mind will start

15:32.080 --> 15:36.120
like, you know, will not be able to necessarily even sustain the right context. So you want

15:36.120 --> 15:40.000
to spend the first few years learning that context, but you don't want to spend the first

15:40.000 --> 15:47.680
few years just learning the letter of the some tradition that you go into without actually

15:47.680 --> 15:52.360
understanding why you're doing it or developing that authentic recognition that it's still

15:52.360 --> 15:56.040
up to you, whether you keep it or not, and to what extent and you want to see the intentions

15:56.040 --> 16:01.080
behind your actions there. Because that's often like, okay, so basically even that process

16:01.080 --> 16:07.880
of learning for five years from a senior monk has become like a mechanical letter of stuff

16:07.880 --> 16:13.040
you go through without actually learning. And without monk teaching you either. So just

16:13.040 --> 16:21.160
for five years, you're under someone's like tutorship. But in reality is just basically

16:21.160 --> 16:30.600
learning of that external form, external letter, not being taught responsibility behind, not

16:30.600 --> 16:34.920
being taught how to see the responsibility behind and how to take it on, in which case

16:34.920 --> 16:39.480
you would, you wouldn't even need them the further definitions of these rules, because

16:39.480 --> 16:43.240
you would be unable to ignore the unwholesome intentions before you act. So you wouldn't

16:43.240 --> 16:52.600
act. That's the training. But even training has become like a traditional form. In the

16:52.600 --> 17:00.360
same sense, external on a level of syllabata paramasa on the level of virtue. Dead. Well,

17:00.360 --> 17:05.840
yeah, it's just, it's like a dead matter in that sense. Yeah. But individually, anybody

17:05.840 --> 17:10.840
can rekindle it for themselves if they actually exactly started in the suttas, reading the

17:10.840 --> 17:14.880
origin stories and so on. And you start seeing food, you get you get in that livable context

17:14.880 --> 17:19.200
and it's about the state of mind. It's about the lab, the perception how I perceive it.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.200
What I choose to do, it's not about, you know, commentary of a sub commentary of a sub commentary

17:23.200 --> 17:27.120
defining this is allowable. And then another commentary defining that is not allowable.

17:27.120 --> 17:32.360
And me now spending nights and figure out who might be more right than these. No, where

17:32.360 --> 17:37.080
is my attention rooted? You got your answer. And on top of that, not just that you got

17:37.080 --> 17:41.840
the answer as to what is the right thing to do. You also started accomplishing yourself

17:41.840 --> 17:48.800
in virtue, which is a basis for suttapat. So if you don't have the right view, if you

17:48.800 --> 17:52.640
have not reached the few fruits of stream entry is because you haven't been accomplishing

17:52.640 --> 17:59.000
virtue. And it's a good news, because now you know what to do. Comptuous haven virtue.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.800
How do you do that? By taking it personally. Learning the rules, sure, learning interpretation

18:04.800 --> 18:11.240
sure, but not relying on the word of the rule, the authority of interpretation of tradition

18:11.240 --> 18:15.800
as this is why it's kept. No, it's kept because I choose to keep it. And I choose to keep

18:15.800 --> 18:20.680
it because I see direct relationship between that and wholesome mind or not that and unwholesome

18:20.680 --> 18:27.720
mind. And that will inevitably initially certainly bring the doubt, bring that sense

18:27.720 --> 18:32.920
of Oh, so I could just decide to not keep exactly. And you're going to feel the weight

18:32.920 --> 18:39.800
of keeping that. And that's how you become accomplished. But also doing that, you will

18:39.800 --> 18:45.960
eventually begin to see which rules are actually obsolete. Yes, but you wouldn't really worry

18:45.960 --> 18:52.320
about that. But you would become self evident. Exactly. The minor rules will not affect him.

18:52.320 --> 18:57.920
And he will know that he'd stay confess, he wouldn't have an issue. But the sometimes

18:57.920 --> 19:02.080
the problem is if a person is not accomplishing the virtue, and then get a sense of righteousness

19:02.080 --> 19:06.360
of discovering of this, what we are saying. And then they just try to form a new tradition

19:06.360 --> 19:12.960
of dismissing all the traditions and interpreting things for yourself in a same external manner

19:12.960 --> 19:17.440
of seal about a paramasa. You don't need to change anything. You need to take things

19:17.440 --> 19:22.440
personally. And then what needs to be changed will happen by itself. Because you have the

19:22.440 --> 19:27.960
authentic mind, you have the accomplishment in virtue. Samad is there. What change occurs

19:27.960 --> 19:31.680
will be the right change. You wouldn't have to do it. You wouldn't have to act out of

19:31.680 --> 19:36.840
it. In other words, you would naturally drift away from things that are unsuitable, traditions

19:36.840 --> 19:42.760
that are unsuitable, practices that are unsuitable into the directions that are suitable for the

19:42.760 --> 19:46.720
right view, for dispassion and for everything else, without needing to make a big deal out

19:46.720 --> 19:54.720
of it. But you wouldn't become this self righteous, impossible, impossible. You would not either

19:54.720 --> 19:59.720
become scared. You wouldn't be self righteous trying to change everybody. But if everybody

19:59.720 --> 20:04.440
comes after an account of it, you wouldn't show because you know what's right. So you

20:04.440 --> 20:09.160
wouldn't need to change the established external norms. But you wouldn't be afraid to challenge

20:09.160 --> 20:14.720
your mind because it's not rooted in your conceit. It's rooted in recognition of what

20:14.720 --> 20:19.080
the accomplishment of virtue is and the right view. So if you were to question those things,

20:19.080 --> 20:22.600
you wouldn't just, you know, be on a crusade to change though, as I said. But if it comes

20:22.600 --> 20:30.800
up to it, you wouldn't be afraid of it. If circumstances bring it up, you will have no

20:30.800 --> 20:42.000
issues dealing with it and addressing it. There's another sutta, Samanapala sutta. The Buddha

20:42.000 --> 20:49.480
says, a manlicant, a monk, thus accomplished in virtue, sees no danger in any quarter in

20:49.480 --> 20:57.840
regards to their virtuous restraint. It is like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees

20:57.840 --> 21:04.400
no danger from his enemies in any direction. In that same way, a monk, thus accomplished

21:04.400 --> 21:10.920
in virtue, sees no danger in any direction in regards to their virtuous restraint. When

21:10.920 --> 21:19.720
they have this aggregate, this domain of noble virtue, this kinder of noble virtue, they

21:19.720 --> 21:27.040
experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. That is how a monk is accomplished in virtue.

21:27.040 --> 21:34.320
So, yeah, you, the monk who has ceased to depend on the external circumstances, external

21:34.320 --> 21:41.680
authority, external definitions, external rules, external requirements, has become accomplished

21:41.680 --> 21:47.200
in virtue because internal criteria, as in not, I choose to interval, no, knowing right

21:47.200 --> 21:52.160
is right, wrong is wrong, wholesome is wholesome, I hope, means knowing last aversion delusion,

21:52.160 --> 21:57.360
sufficiently enough to always see it and not act out of it. You practice that, you will

21:57.360 --> 22:01.000
become accomplished in that and then doesn't matter the circumstance, doesn't matter what

22:01.000 --> 22:06.200
quarter the circumstances arrive at you from what direction. There is no danger because

22:06.200 --> 22:10.180
you're not depending on that. So, if somebody comes and starts questioning the certain

22:10.180 --> 22:14.160
interpretation of a letter or a rule, it doesn't matter because that's not what your virtue

22:14.160 --> 22:18.960
is based on. It was based on you not doing anything out of intention of greed or version

22:18.960 --> 22:25.600
delusion. So, even if somebody says, look, this, all these rules were actually wrong,

22:25.600 --> 22:29.280
they were written by somebody later in Jai, in search of their, they're not right, makes

22:29.280 --> 22:32.800
no difference. And you will actually know that they were right, even if somebody did

22:32.800 --> 22:37.080
add them, they added them rightly because they're according to the standard of dhamma, standard

22:37.080 --> 22:44.320
of dispassion, disenchantment, non-grid, non-version, non-delusion. But for as long as you put the

22:44.320 --> 22:51.760
letter first, the external authority of syllabata baramasa first, you will not see this because

22:51.760 --> 22:55.360
you're refusing to take responsibility for it and allow it to become internal because

22:55.360 --> 23:01.160
it's unpleasant. The weight of it is unpleasant, the weight of responsibility is unpleasant,

23:01.160 --> 23:05.760
the pressure is unpleasant, the liability to doubt it's unpleasant and you have to

23:05.760 --> 23:21.240
do it. Developing of samadhi is unpleasant. And same, eight precepts for a lay person same.

23:21.240 --> 23:26.880
That's why often the Buddha would not even overly define things because if the mind hasn't

23:26.880 --> 23:31.120
strayed from the right context of non-grid, non-version, non-delusion, recognizes that

23:31.120 --> 23:37.920
state of mind doesn't act harder with regardless of what the action might be, you don't need

23:37.920 --> 23:42.960
extra and extra layers of definitions and words and interpretations and meanings because

23:42.960 --> 23:48.840
the meaning is there, the context is there, it's clear. So that's practically eight precepts

23:48.840 --> 23:55.560
are modern enough, certainly for anagami. In a lay setting, for a monkey, you'll be

23:55.560 --> 24:02.320
concerned, accomplished to the same virtue, the same threat. I like the way it's said

24:02.320 --> 24:12.720
like that he is accomplished or attained in possessors, the aggregate of virtue. He is

24:12.720 --> 24:19.840
created in aggregate, that now he can recognize. He can recognize and he's encouraged to recollect

24:19.840 --> 24:24.720
and dwell because it will re-inspire confidence and sense of safety and gladness that will

24:24.720 --> 24:31.400
then bring Samadhi and so on to fulfilment and clear understanding of what, what, what,

24:31.400 --> 24:38.200
but not without it. And that is, again, that is the entire practice. Your Samadhi comes

24:38.200 --> 24:42.920
out of it, your Panya comes out of it. The more you do it, the more you perfect it,

24:42.920 --> 24:49.560
greed aversion, delusion, removed from physical, verbal and mental. That's what Dhamma is.

24:49.560 --> 24:54.640
So start on the physical level and that is your Samadhi, that is your Panya, that is

24:54.640 --> 25:04.040
your practice towards Sotabhati and Haya. It's not found elsewhere, it's not found after,

25:04.040 --> 25:09.360
it's right there and then. It's not done for just a short period of time and then. That's

25:09.360 --> 25:14.840
one thing, it's better to even like, if you, if you, or eight pieces too much as a layperson,

25:14.840 --> 25:21.240
take the five precepts for the rest of your life, but not for the weekend. Because means

25:21.240 --> 25:25.360
you never really allow, you never really consider changing the order of what's important to

25:25.360 --> 25:29.200
you. Sensuality is important to you. So now you realise that, yeah, precepts are good

25:29.200 --> 25:32.560
and maybe I should do something about it, but then you only do it like for two or three

25:32.560 --> 25:39.560
days or five days. Means, oh, you're just sort of toying with it while at the same time

25:39.560 --> 25:45.960
refusing to allow the actual, no centrality to be put second and my precepts will now be

25:45.960 --> 25:53.240
first for the rest of my life. And that's important. That's where the jianda takes the

25:53.240 --> 25:59.080
training of virtue. You need to take it in that ultimate sense. Not to this conditional,

25:59.080 --> 26:04.360
I'll do it a bit until I get a meditation experience or something. So it's in that sense,

26:04.360 --> 26:08.760
it's better to have five precepts, but for the rest of your life, then to like, no precepts

26:08.760 --> 26:14.840
and then super or steer level of celibacy for 10 days and then, boom, no precepts at

26:14.840 --> 26:19.360
all. Because that is not accomplishing keeping. It's not accomplishing anything really. Like,

26:19.360 --> 26:24.680
I mean, you're obviously trying. So that's a good thing, I suppose. But you want to recognize

26:24.680 --> 26:30.720
the gradual training starts gradually and starts in that responsible sense, but an absolutely

26:30.720 --> 26:36.400
non-negotiable sense. So you're like, okay, so what can I sustain? And what am I able

26:36.400 --> 26:42.640
to? Can I make this determination for the rest of my life? To not kill, cheat, lie,

26:42.640 --> 26:49.160
steal, misconduct, take in dog skirts. And if just that thought scares you, I can't do

26:49.160 --> 26:55.320
this, that you need to do that first before you can even consider the direction of any

26:55.320 --> 27:01.720
practice whatsoever. Because that is the practice. You considering that is the practice. You making

27:01.720 --> 27:05.600
yourself being able to determine to keep the five pieces for the rest of your life or eight

27:05.600 --> 27:11.600
pieces for the rest of your life is the beginning of your accomplishment in virtue. You won't

27:11.600 --> 27:18.800
come up, come, come, like a, you won't result on its own somehow, because you got a very,

27:18.800 --> 27:23.640
very, very potent meditation method that will now, if you adhere to it, just create this

27:23.640 --> 27:24.640
virtue for you.

27:24.640 --> 27:34.920
Now the sutra called the restraint of the patimaka. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the blessed

27:34.920 --> 27:25.640
one and asked him,

27:25.640 --> 27:42.360
Pranable sir, it would be good if the blessed one would teach me the dhamma in brief so that

27:42.360 --> 27:48.000
having heard the dhamma from the blessed one, I might dwell alone with drawn, diligent,

27:48.000 --> 27:56.600
ardent and residue. And the Buddha replies, in that case bhikkhu purify the very beginning

27:56.600 --> 28:04.200
of wholesome states. And what is the beginning of wholesome states? Here bhikkhu dwell restrained

28:04.200 --> 28:10.440
by the restraint of the patimaka, accomplished in good conduct and proper resort seeing danger

28:10.440 --> 28:16.240
in the slightest faults, having undertaken a training rule, straining them. When bhikkhu

28:16.240 --> 28:22.720
dwell restrained in such a way, seeing the danger in the slightest faults, then based

28:22.720 --> 28:29.840
upon that virtue, established upon virtue, you should develop the four establishments

28:29.840 --> 28:36.240
of mindfulness, the satipatana, not before that.

28:36.240 --> 28:41.120
So you're doing your mindfulness before you even accomplish yourself in precepts, it's

28:41.120 --> 28:46.560
just putting the cart in front of a horse and expecting it to move.

28:46.560 --> 28:50.280
There's no way to have that type of discernment.

28:50.280 --> 28:55.120
No, no, but it's the same, that's why it's mindfulness samadhi, it's the same development,

28:55.120 --> 29:03.160
same thing that comes on the basis of established, uncompromised, unbroken virtue.

29:03.160 --> 29:16.920
So, how do you uncompromise your virtue by overly defining your rules and sort of proliferating

29:16.920 --> 29:22.760
aspects or by simply not accepting any action that your mind offers you out of greed, aversion,

29:22.760 --> 29:23.760
delusion.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.760
And you know that.

29:26.760 --> 29:31.920
Am I acting out of hindrances? Am I acting out of doubt? Am I acting out of restlessness?

29:31.920 --> 29:38.920
Am I acting out of sensuality, anger, sloth and laziness? It's unwholesome. If I don't

29:38.920 --> 29:43.560
do it, I am accomplished in virtue. So you will be abandoning hindrances as well, which

29:43.560 --> 29:44.560
is what samadhi is.

29:44.560 --> 29:50.560
And not acting out of unwholesome states, I mean we speak about it so often. And all

29:50.560 --> 29:55.440
of that is contained between you and your relationship with your own virtue or lack of

29:55.440 --> 29:56.440
it.

29:56.440 --> 30:01.160
When I say lack of virtue, it doesn't mean you don't keep the precepts, it means you

30:01.160 --> 30:06.180
keep them, but in that external celibar parama sense and you are not internally becoming

30:06.180 --> 30:12.200
accomplished in those rules. In other words, you are not internalizing criteria for unwholesome

30:12.200 --> 30:16.800
that you are avoiding, you are just adhering to the definition through your intellect,

30:16.800 --> 30:19.000
tradition, authority and so on.

30:19.000 --> 30:26.920
That if you don't have the clarity that comes from accomplishment or in virtue, you cannot

30:26.920 --> 30:34.280
be mindful of the body. No, no, your mindfulness will be external in the same sense your responsibility

30:34.280 --> 30:37.920
for your virtues is external. So when you do mindfulness, you will be doing it on the

30:37.920 --> 30:42.400
level of objects of your senses, which is not mindfulness, will be like a duty. That's

30:42.400 --> 30:46.960
exactly what meditation technique is for people. It's often taken in a sense of another external

30:46.960 --> 30:54.640
duty that I must do and it's certainly always taken on the level of sense objects, observations,

30:54.640 --> 31:00.680
nematiles and whatever else, movements, motions, it's never taken as the internal recitations,

31:00.680 --> 31:07.440
recitations, mantras, visualizations, yeah, every and that's why it's taken there because

31:07.440 --> 31:12.040
there's no basis for mindfulness, no sufficient basis for mindfulness to be taken on the right

31:12.040 --> 31:17.280
peripheral, sufficiently peripheral context. So what happens then is just you take it where

31:17.280 --> 31:20.920
your mind is and your mind is out there on the external things because you want to avoid

31:20.920 --> 31:25.880
doubt and all these things. You're just adhering to external things with a sense of duty.

31:25.880 --> 31:35.200
Sila Vata Paramasa. And then your meditation becomes on the level of that Sila Vata Paramasa.

31:35.200 --> 31:40.360
And then your discernment is on that level. In other words, it's not a discernment. You're

31:40.360 --> 31:44.520
discerning things more on the level of sense objects without having the right context,

31:44.520 --> 31:49.840
the right basis for it. All because you have an larger self to become accomplished in that

31:49.840 --> 31:54.600
virtue correctly, you haven't taken it up, you haven't accepted the weight of responsibility

31:54.600 --> 32:21.040
for it and endured it.
