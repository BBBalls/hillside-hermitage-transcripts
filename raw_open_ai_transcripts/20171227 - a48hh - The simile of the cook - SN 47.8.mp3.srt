1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
This sutra is from chapter 47 of the Sangyutinakaya, sutra number 8, called the kuk.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,520
Bikus, suppose a foolish, incompetent, unskillful kuk, or to present a king or royal minister

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,800
with various kinds of curries, sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, sharp, mild, salty, bland.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,160
That foolish, incompetent, unskillful kuk does not pick up the sign of his master's own preference.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,760
Today this curry please my master, or he reached for this one, or he took a lot of this one,

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,720
or he spoke in praise of this one, or the sour curry please my master, or he reached for

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,840
the sour one, or he took a lot of the sour one, or he spoke in praise of the sour one,

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,120
or the bitter curry, the pungent curry, so on and so forth, or he spoke in praise of some other curry.

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,880
That foolish, incompetent, unskillful kuk does not gain gifts of clothing, wages and bonuses,

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:16,080
for what reason, because that foolish, incompetent, unskillful kuk does not pick up the sign of his own master's preference.

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,320
So too, Beku's, here some foolish, incompetent, unskillful Beku dwells contemplating the body and the body,

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,520
ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and pleasure in regard to the world.

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,960
While he dwells contemplating the body and the body, his mind does not become concentrated,

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,440
his corruptions are not abandoned, he does not pick up that sign,

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,680
that foolish, incompetent, unskillful Beku does not gain pleasant dwellings in his very life,

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,160
nor does he gain nothing but the body and the body, and the body and the body and the body of his own master.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,440
While he dwells contemplating the body and the body, his mind does not become concentrated,

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,520
his corruptions are not abandoned, he does not pick up that sign,

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,360
competent unskillful beacodes not gain pleasant dwellings in this very life, nor does he gain

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,800
mind from the Sinclair comprehension, for what reason? Because beacodes let foolish and

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,440
competent unskillful beacodes does not pick up the sign of his own mind. Suppose beacodes

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,760
a wise competent skillful cook were to present a king or royal minister with various kinds

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,480
of curries that wise competent skillful cook picks up the sign of his master's own preference.

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,720
Today this curry please my master or he spoke and praised this one so on and so forth.

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,160
That wise competent skillful cook gains gifts of clothing, wages and bonuses for what reason,

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,600
because that wise competent skillful cook picks up the sign of his own master's preference.

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,440
So two beacodes, here some wise competent skillful beacodes dwellings contemplating the body

28
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,480
in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,560
displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating the body in the body, his mind

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,720
becomes concentrated, his corruptions are abandoned, he picks up that sign, he does the same with

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,640
feelings and feelings, mind and mind, phenomena and phenomena. That wise competent skillful beacodes

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,920
gains pleasant dwellings in his very life and he gains mind from this clear comprehension

33
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,560
for what reason, because beacodes that wise competent skillful beacodes picks up the sign of

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,880
his own mind. Some foolish beacodes dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly

35
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,440
comprehending mindful. So it seems like he is in a sense practicing stippotana but something's

36
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,800
still gone wrong. Well, gone wrong in a sense of he's not making enough effort.

37
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,760
So he says his mind does not become concentrated, his corruptions are not abandoned, he does not

38
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:18,240
pick up that sign. And that's how an audio will still remain unfinished. Like sign in terms of

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:28,080
limiter, signs, characteristics, tokens of a thing of the body or the feeling, of the mind in this

40
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,400
case, having given us the audio minds of wants to turn away from it, does want to be focused

41
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,200
really over, whatever. But he's not discerning it. Exactly, if you're not discerning that,

42
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,160
not discerning that background of the phenomena that appear as a result of

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
in practicing mindfulness of the body.

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,680
Yeah, that's why I think it's in that similar sort of, well, in that principle, I think that's

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,040
what it's rooted, it's all the idea of like a junior monastic training of sort of attending to

46
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,360
like a senior monk. And you don't do it. Well, I mean, people can listen to it. I mean, that's a

47
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,680
approach, but why? Or rather, how? You can actually benefit from it. If you do it using this,

48
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,640
over if I can exercise and like, okay, you're not going to go with your will, you go with the

49
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,080
senior monk's will. Not because of some blind devotion, simply because, well, it's just another

50
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,640
point of view to your experience as a whole that has a reason. It's a point of view that's the

51
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:40,080
closest to me. I might point of view. And that exercise can sort of train the mind in picking

52
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:49,440
up on things or signs, limiters. In this particular case of what a senior monk might need or require,

53
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,720
but generally, it will actually train the mind to pick on the signs,

54
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,160
regardless whether it's internal or external, whether it's your point of view or their point of

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,880
view. It doesn't matter. You will start seeing more of the background. And when you know,

56
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,280
how you're not just doing what you want to do, you're actually following in a way someone

57
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,280
else's will, based on trust, based on confidence. And then you start picking on these things,

58
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,200
and the mind just start doing the same everywhere. Against its will, so to speak.

59
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:31,120
In that sense, even such sort of task of attending and being helpful and so on, you can actually

60
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,680
benefit from. But not if you just didn't mind it as like, you know, I'm the best servant in the world,

61
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,440
like, well, what's the point? So that's why that similarly is quite close to that, like, you know,

62
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,640
you wouldn't have to. His job is to cook, but he really kind of makes that extra effort,

63
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,400
because that extra effort is not actually effort as much. It's more like just learning how to

64
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,800
notice it always. It doesn't matter if it's internal or external or both. You start picking on stuff.

65
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,360
And there is a truth in that, like, when you meet monks throughout the monastery,

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
the ones that sort of pick on little things, like, what kind of, what needs to, like, they don't

67
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,960
need to be told, constantly do this, to do that, and they're just like a robot. They will be picking

68
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,840
on stuff. They are generally more aware, because that's the way how you pick on it,

69
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,120
on these peripheral little signs and tokens that show themselves. They're not like, in your face,

70
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,320
do this. Don't do that. Okay. No, they just pick on it, and then they make that effort,

71
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,760
so to not neglect that habit. So there is a place for a whole kind of high training and stuff,

72
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,320
but obviously, you know, some kind of just kind of take it blindly, and people don't necessarily

73
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:52,560
benefit from it as much as they could. So, yeah, it's quite a, it's a good practice.

74
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,680
It's a good practice. Because, you know, those are easy problems to pick on.

75
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,640
Oh, you like that tea. He doesn't use this umbrella. Oh, this is dirty, I could clean, and so on.

76
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,920
That's much easier to pick, and subtle tokens of your mind, like,

77
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:15,920
how it, like, to what degree turns away from, you know, practicing concentration on a heavy

78
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,640
humid day that doesn't want to do it so I'm like, that will take time to be certain. But if you constantly

79
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:30,400
just try to discern only that, it will be like, basically, what's the expression? A piece is too big

80
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,480
to chew, right away. And I'll just be able to take them bomb. Exactly. Yeah. Then it just gets

81
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,960
all around me. But it's the same principle that you can train in regard to external circumstances,

82
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,960
and then it becomes easier to be seen. So, when it's talking about signs and tokens,

83
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,080
it's a very kind of general term. Very general term. Very general term.

84
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,880
Very general term. Yes, basically, how you know anything is anything.

85
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,440
Exactly. That's, you know, that's how the whole kind of, the, the, the, the, the,

86
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,040
the number of the designation works by the signs and tokens you're testing in and so on. So, it's just,

87
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,920
it's structural, but you, signs and tokens are always in the background. You know, this is a no.

88
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,760
That's the thing that you have signs of, that defines it as such, that design is in a such.

89
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
So, signs and tokens will be a level of, of intentionality as well. That's why it's not,

90
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,200
it's not kind of, there's not like a clear distinction. It's not a level of a mind.

91
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,960
Exactly. On that background. So, just by picking signs and tokens with your eyes, your ears,

92
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,560
you're already training your mind in regard to the same principle.

93
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,760
As opposed to just going to go straight into the abstract mode and try and sign the tokens

94
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,760
and then like you are nothing to root in it. But once you start seeing it in an obvious course

95
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,120
manner, you can start sort of extrapolating that the principle out of it and then this

96
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,200
is certainly the elsewhere, even just purely on a level of thoughts and so on.

97
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Let's start about that entire time with the sign of the mind, which is in the human,

98
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,000
and then bring up. Like basically that in the question, how do I know my mind is in such a way?

99
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,520
Like, pick up the token of it. Well, what do you mean in such a way? What way?

100
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,280
Like, oh, I have a sleepy mind, but how was that? How was it that I know that?

101
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,480
I don't know that well because the sleepiness is there, but how can you know that that is

102
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,080
the sign of the mind? Well, you know that when you know it's the sign of the mind,

103
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
when that peripheral phenomenon of picking those peripheral tokens has been developed

104
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,760
to such an extent that now it's a phenomenon itself. On that peripheral level?

105
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,480
Yeah, I mean, I didn't mean to say that, oh, I need things in front of me,

106
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,000
there is the sleepiness there and then just as a rhetorical question, I ask myself.

107
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,160
Oh, I see. I thought it was an initial question.

108
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
Oh, no. How do I explain it?

109
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,880
I see what you mean. Yeah, oh, how do I know exactly?

110
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
It's time looking. How do I do it?

111
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,840
Okay, so I guess you know that my experience now is all restless,

112
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,360
so I'm sleepy. How? How do I know that?

113
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,440
And then it's time looking for certain tokens and signs of restlessness,

114
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,400
sleepiness that's sort of defined the state of the mind.

115
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,440
So when you become proficient in that, so to speak, and seeing that phenomenon of that peripheral,

116
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
then that's the sign of the mind. You recognize the peripheral.

117
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,760
The phenomenon of the peripheral is what the mind is.

118
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,080
It is that peripheral, but it's not seen as a phenomenon.

119
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,000
You might see peripheral in regard to its actual, but you don't see peripheral as a phenomenon of peripheral,

120
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,920
all the peripheral, which means you don't see the sign of your mind.

121
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
You don't see your mind as a phenomenon.

122
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,840
What do you mean the peripheral of the peripheral?

123
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,920
I don't know that. Peripheral on the peripheral on the peripheral.

124
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,040
Peripheral on the peripheral is not necessarily, but you see peripheral as peripheral.

125
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
As a phenomenon, it always arises in regard to no matter what actual.

126
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,440
So it stops being kind of dependent during your inference of it,

127
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,720
it stops being dependent upon the content that you're actual and then I see peripheral.

128
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,440
You start like that, but the point is basically discern the nature of peripheral.

129
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
And that's basically discerning the phenomenon of the mind.

130
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,560
Well, for you, you know, at that stage, you would even stop kind of having to think about peripheral

131
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,400
of the actual, which is always kind of a revelation,

132
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,160
which you see text with the mind is, because that is always present in a way.

133
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,080
For as long as the parallel is in spanned,

134
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
there would be the domain of peripheral.

135
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,840
And obviously learning to see as peripheral,

136
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,000
I've seen peripheral on the peripheral,

137
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,800
I mean, like, you don't over-attended and think with an extra actual element,

138
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,880
but you see forwarded it.

139
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:13,280
That one should also, I guess, see its determinations.

140
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,080
It's peripheral side of the mind, like what determines it.

141
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Well, yeah, I mean, you've seen those only once you start seeing the peripheral,

142
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,800
some of you can't be seen determinations,

143
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,360
and then we'll reveal what they determine. Terminations can only be seen once you have that,

144
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,560
which is being determined. So through that, you see that, which determines it,

145
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,360
because it's not only in their connection,

146
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,400
like the determination left determines this thing far, far right.

147
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,280
It's by seeing the determine through there, through it,

148
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,360
through its simultaneous presence, you can discern what determines its simultaneously,

149
00:13:49,360 --> 00:14:05,760
it's present, which is feeling and perception. Yeah, if you don't do it in the mind, yeah.

150
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:26,080
Is there a difference between just a mind that is, like I say, sleeping versus being affected by

151
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:36,160
the hindrance of sleeping at stop and twerk or heavy on transit? What do you mean?

152
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,400
You mean, can I not be sleepy? Well, of course, they can become tired,

153
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,080
but it's different for them. Yeah, because they're not, their mind is not bound by any of such

154
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:54,480
illnesses. It won't be bound. Those illnesses won't be inducing any long use or any of those who, for the mind,

155
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,400
it hasn't broke free from illnesses. So then it's on the hindrance anymore.

156
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,720
But they still be described in a sense as though it's the eye-entire. Yeah, yeah, of course,

157
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,520
yeah. But that's within an eye-end because it's just a hollow shell of expression that we spoke

158
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:20,320
before, whereas herpetogen is tired, that will just mean lack of mindfulness. Well, exactly,

159
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,440
yeah. For him being tired or having any of your five hindrance means obstruction to mind from

160
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:33,920
the obstruction to create discernment because he has not seen through those thick kind of

161
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:41,040
clowns of hindrances. But once that's seen through and understood, then while you're not

162
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,720
affected by that, you're not in the power. So then it would be generally, because that's another

163
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,880
thing with hindrances, they sort of are not known as escape from hindrance. You have to be evolving

164
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,160
around the hindrance. So by being a little bit sleepy, not knowing what to do, you have to buy the

165
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,880
sleeping, you have to be able to do it in the sleepiness, or we're doing the restlessness, or we're doing

166
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:10,720
the anger, by not knowing escape from it. By knowing escape, then sleepiness comes at each

167
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,160
genuine sleepiness. You didn't come as a result of you being confused and you got to it and then

168
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,040
you're using it. And so it's just genuine sleepiness. And then you know, actually, it's just

169
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,280
tremendous sleepiness, which means some fat. I'm not very sleepy, basically. But when it's a

170
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,240
hindrance, it's something that you kind of give into. You give into restlessness, you give into

171
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:39,200
doubt, you give in, because you don't know escape from it. And by giving in, you have to buy it.

172
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:52,720
And so one should begin then by having mindfulness in regard to hindrance, then you understand

173
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,440
it. It's a good thing. It arrives. Mindful and sure, but it comes often down to just enduring them.

174
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:08,160
And during the kind of central cravings of any kind, and during the ill will, and during the

175
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,080
anger, there is an enduring sleepiness, enduring doubt. That's a hard thing for much to do,

176
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,480
because doubt feels justified. When you doubt it in the night or something, you just feel

177
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,640
justified in figuring it out. But there's a point where figuring it out sort of ceases to be

178
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,640
the motivation. It's just kind of indulging the doubt. Just fueling the doubt, because the

179
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,880
doubt is burning and you do not drink it. And then you end up, you know, like sometimes

180
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
monks get so cold out for three days, they kind of sleep. There's a march to start

181
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,960
in doubting. Because they're indulging it and they have to hurry so much with their indulgence of

182
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,720
sleep. How can you not think of those doubts and things straight? If you're mindful, you will

183
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
know where to go online. If you don't give it into that emotional pressure of the doubt.

184
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Or like I just, I'm just so tired, I just need to sleep. And then you just

185
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,160
hold the commit to sleep. That's hard, because you don't have to be angry, you do have to sleep.

186
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
Yeah, exactly. So like, okay, so I have to sleep, but I have to sleep mindfully so I can't just

187
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:17,040
overdue sleep. But when it's hard, you just open up the floodgates and you can't sleep.

188
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:27,760
So, and there's a thing, mindfulness, if done rightly, cannot not be effortless.

189
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,480
It doesn't require any effort, mindfulness. It doesn't require any strain.

190
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,760
Mindfulness is just a recognition, it's a simple and discernible, what has arisen.

191
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,840
And therefore you can't add too much of mindfulness. But mindfulness is not clarified and

192
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,840
properly developed, then yet. Ah, it just needs to sleep, I can't like it. And then you throw

193
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,880
away mindfulness as well. But mindfulness does not need to interfere, but done rightly,

194
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,760
wanted to fear. Because it looks beyond, it goes beyond any of the inferences. So I need to sleep,

195
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,200
you go to sleep, that does not mean losing mindfulness. Oh, I have a degree of doubt,

196
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,120
I need to clarify something, you're going to clarify something without losing mindfulness,

197
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,640
you don't get caught in a whirlpool sort of problem, or doubt. And same, I thought there is a

198
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,600
disagreeable feeling here, present, there's this misguided man in front of me is irritating,

199
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,920
but you don't get angry, because mindfulness does not need to kind of go out of window when you

200
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:38,880
get irritated. So then, none of those things can sort of grow into hindrance, which is when

201
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:48,080
it overtakes the mind, not mind keeps it keeps it in check. That's what it said for an argument,

202
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:57,520
the feelings cannot overwhelm, or maybe the reference of it is that things don't overwhelm

203
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,800
my mind, is the argument mind is overwhelmed things. I think that's the birth of thought.

204
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,280
Okay, let me add one of those thoughts that we've had in the argument. So the point is,

205
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,960
the argument is always above, his mind is that that's why he's an argument, that's all this

206
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,720
comparisons to it. It's like a great mountain, the movable rock, against the wind, and I don't

207
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,080
know if this doesn't budge. It seems to be as simple as anything that he seems to rise,

208
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,720
just irrelevant to you, not irrelevantly, in different way.

209
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:44,080
That's when you can see that the mind that's rooted in mindfulness, that does not

210
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,400
drop mindfulness, even when sleepiness is present or agitation or sense-craming. That's when

211
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,920
you start seeing that no matter how you find the five hindrances, they entirely pertain to body

212
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:05,440
to the sense aspect, including doubt, doubt always requires you to feel, to look for something more,

213
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,360
to read something more, to hear something more, to think something more. So you realize that all

214
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,280
the hindrances are actually both of them, once the mind drags free from them, but their potential

215
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,880
is that in your body, and then you revent it from the hindrance, then your happiness,

216
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,480
for as long as there is this body, there will be hunger arising, not as an injury.

217
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,960
For as long as there is this body, they will be disagreeable feelings arising, not as a hindrance.

218
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,880
For as long as there is this body, they will be sleeping as arising, not as a hindrance.

219
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,240
For as long as there is this body with these senses, they will be certain like a clarity

220
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,920
in regard to certain things, they pertain to their domain, not like a clarity in regard to the

221
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,680
earth and wisdom, not as a hindrance, even then. So then when you realize basically,

222
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,000
ah, no matter what hindrance it is, it is always bodily. And if the mind is older,

223
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,720
you kind of see it through the nature of the body, mind is seen, then automatically

224
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
through nature engines, it is because they are seen as pertain to the body.

225
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,560
So then you can, you can go and sleep with clear conscious mindfully, you can wake up with clear

226
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,600
conscious mindfully, you would be eating with clear conscious mindfully, and so you couldn't do

227
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:28,880
anything wrong. Yeah, where I'm at now, it sounds very strapped, good, it's like, oh yes,

228
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,760
it's all, you know, you're tired, it feels like it's weighing, yeah, I'm pointing my head though.

229
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,200
It is, it is, that's exactly what it's weighing, but that's not what your mind is.

230
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,440
Your mind is not in your head. Right, I didn't mean to say pointing at my head.

231
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,920
Right, right, right, but no, you can do, yeah, yeah, it just feels, it's just weighing, yeah, sure,

232
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,000
but mindfulness in terms of just recognition of whatever has a reason,

233
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,520
even if it's weighing, weighing for you, and so on. That's effort, that just requires only

234
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,960
presence of a thing which is present on its own, so you don't have to do it, you don't have to

235
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,160
maintain it. What you have to do is refrain from doing things they will make you forget about it.

236
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,560
So, let's just refrain from giving in, then you don't have to mind for it.

237
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,520
You refrain from engaging your wholesome, then you don't have to mind for it.

238
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,480
What I meant to say was that everything in my experience is saying that the tiredness

239
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,080
is affecting, like, is a mental thing as well as a bodily thing. Sure.

240
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,280
Because your mind is not very mindfulness, your mind is really bodied, so that mind is affected

241
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,760
by all that bodily stuff. That's why you, you know, you exercise the pressure already,

242
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:53,840
anybody cravings, food, anger, meditation, yeah, your body, because the mind is delirious,

243
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,280
but the mind is developed through that indifferent presence of mindfulness and discernment of that,

244
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:10,160
so that, but if at all, then the mind is beyond it. Like in the sense that these are all

245
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,120
have to have the body present. Well, you say, my own, my body is tired and my mind is tired,

246
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,120
but mindfulness in regard to both is not tired, cannot be tired. Just the discernment of the

247
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,360
just simple presence of both, the mind isn't being mindful through the engines. Yeah.

248
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,280
So mindfulness in a way precedes that, which is mind for you right now. When your mind gets

249
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,280
developed, then mind gets aligned along with what mindfulness is, and that's why mind development

250
00:24:39,280 --> 00:25:09,120
is possible, because the possibility of alignment is there.
