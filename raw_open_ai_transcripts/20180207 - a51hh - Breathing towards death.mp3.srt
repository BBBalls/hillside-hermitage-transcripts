1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
So it's sort of a few things down above my points, what I'm reading.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:20,240
So composure as a result of mine for reading, that's what I'm looking for, that's what I'm

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,240
trying to do.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,440
Okay, while you're ready, you'll need to say straight, what composure is a result, can be

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,960
a result, or rather the right composure is the result of this passion.

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,480
This enchantment, neither the disgust towards the world, towards the senses, central pleasures,

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,720
that's the composure you want.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,600
You don't want some sort of contemporary concentration, technique or something like that.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,040
You want composure based on this passion, based on turning away from the desires towards

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,400
the world.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,160
Mine for me is the death provides you with that.

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:08,760
But as it was the case in the suitors, it's a bit bloody keep us some people over the edge.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,440
So then the alternative, I eat the same thing.

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,840
Just in a form of mindfulness of reading, just in a form of a less personal approach.

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Yes, of course.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,720
Well, yeah, in mindfulness of death, you begin, I am basically subject to death and this

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,120
is disgusting, the body and the mind, thinking through your point of view.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,200
Mindfulness of breathing, you take the breathing as a point of view, not yourself.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,840
And then you are, I'm breathing like this, I'm breathing like that.

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,960
But basically, the fact that the Buddha offered it instead of Maramanosate means it's

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
that thing.

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,040
It's pertains to that thing.

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,600
So if you do mindfulness of reading rightly, you are basically contemplating death rightly,

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,360
and you are experiencing this fashion towards the world rightly.

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,800
You say to our checker, suitors, you are teaching a super meditation.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Oh, yeah, it was a super, wasn't it?

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Yeah, it was a super, wasn't it?

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Yeah, it was a super, I think.

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Yeah, I think so.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Yeah.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Death.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,560
Basically, the super and death kind of just discussed.

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,200
But as I said, it comes to me and this body and I am.

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,600
So if done rightly, if the Buddha said this, you are through to no time, full dispersion

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
right away.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,120
But some people might get a bit too much and then don't think about it, better off without

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
his body.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,120
And then they were jumping off the cliffs and asking those other, that crazy man to kill

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,160
them with a sword and some of them.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,360
Yeah, I was going to say that's what the end goal of the mind from the breathing, that

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,720
attached to the quantumist's mind for dissonance.

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:58,920
All of that is basically rooted or sprints from correct dispassion, like you feel no desire

44
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,600
to lose a world, to lose life.

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,880
And also, you don't feel any desire to a death either.

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Why is it?

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,600
Well, because death is the sort of, well, the notion of death requires the basis, the notion

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,520
of life that you have.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,920
So that's when people, when people are involved with the life, that's when they want death.

50
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:31,200
When their life sort of doesn't go their way, or goes, or it's actually unpleasant, then

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
they want death.

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,160
With the same desire, they are wanting life, now they want the ending of life.

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,840
But when you feel dispassion towards their life, you feel dispassion towards, you don't

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,400
care whether their life is there or not, thus you don't care whether you are alive or

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
not.

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
But possibly, be desiring death either.

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,640
That's why would you be dispassion towards life?

58
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Sorry?

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Why would you be anxious in terms of, you know, because that's, what?

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,920
What way do you see that you watch the breath and you become dispassionate towards life,

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
you know?

62
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
You see the topologies.

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,320
So you mean, how will breath make you dispassionate towards life?

64
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Nothing.

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Yeah.

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,160
Well, by understanding that your life can end in any next scene breath or not breath, without

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
your control.

68
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,160
So you actually have to take that idea of, you have to think about the breath, you can't

69
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
just be watching it.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Oh, yeah, of course.

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Yes, we think it will be going on here.

72
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,000
I mean, I said millions of times before, I'm not talking about modern repassionate techniques

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,160
of Burmese or what, not, or even what people see in life unless you're breathing it.

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
I think.

76
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
Not at all.

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
That's all nonsense.

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
You really assert this.

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,280
And because it was quite clear how you do the breathing.

80
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,920
You're breathing like this, you're breathing like this.

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,440
So basically, you're actively involving your volition in the way how you breathe, while

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,960
you're being mindful of that breath.

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Why?

84
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,920
Because if you do that steadily enough, it will reveal that no amount of volition can cross

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,360
that threshold after which the breath becomes in your control or rather the life that is

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,960
provided by the breath becomes in your control.

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
That's impossible.

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,240
You can only control the manner of your breathing, but the way that your life depends upon

89
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,320
your breath, that's completely inconceivable for you.

90
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,520
To control, to access, to have any input on you, you could just be breathing.

91
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,600
You know, you've got the, you've got control of the, it's control of the intention to

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
breathe in a particular way.

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,800
Yeah, but you don't have control over the way your body.

94
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,240
Or it's like the normal amount of control that you're right now exerting here, breathing

95
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,920
slowly, breathing relaxingly, breathing like this, breathing like that, breathing pleasantly

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:48,920
normally, normal to that control can sort of obscure or prevent the clarity of the life

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,240
can end, the very next, in breath or our breath.

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,760
It just cannot cross into that upon which your life depends.

99
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,800
So that's how you also abroot the notion of self, the notion of me and mine in regard

100
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,640
to your own volition, which is the hardest thing to do, because that's the closest to you.

101
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,680
That's intention, that direction, the point of view, but when you see normal and you do

102
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,480
that long enough, like mindfully, willingly, intentionally, yeah, you live in nothing

103
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
out.

104
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Whatever is there, you're seeing as dependent upon that, which is not in your control,

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,800
which is, which is basically that breath, the, the, the life aspect in that breath, that's

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,800
not in your control, the manner of your breathing you can control, but the fact that your life

107
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,240
depends upon that breath you cannot control, that bodily breath, yeah, that very bodily

108
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,640
breath, yeah, the organs and air moving and everything else, because it is, see, if you're

109
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,280
seeing, if you're watching my intention to breathe, can I actually watch my intention

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
to breathe, you see?

111
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,360
Well, you watch that by breathing, by being my full of your breath, of course, with

112
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,680
intention to breathe, yeah, in a particular way, as I can say, the breath in calming the

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,680
body, the results of that, what I see coming at the same time, this is my, is the body breathing

114
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
out.

115
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,080
Yeah, intention is present, there's some tennis to be the body breathing in such manner.

116
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, but I was the intention to look like an intention, yeah, because I get confused

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,520
with, am I now paying attention to the actual body breathing, it doesn't matter, why am

118
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
I paying attention?

119
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,160
That's where you're paying attention, as long as you're including both things.

120
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,880
Your intention can be paying more attention to the bodily aspect or the eye and breathing

121
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
aspect, doesn't matter.

122
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
What is that?

123
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,240
It doesn't matter, as long as both things are included, and nothing is left out in regard

124
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:00,840
to seeing that fundamental dependence upon that, which is not in your control.

125
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,920
This is an oxygen present in the breath, whatever you want to call it, whatever you want

126
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,640
to label it, whatever you want to designate it, doesn't matter, the point is, if your intention

127
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:17,240
of breathing can defeat your life depends upon it, you can control only so far, ultimately

128
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
you can't.

129
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:32,320
Because these exercises are like breathing, calm, calming the body, breathing, calm the

130
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:40,000
bodily from it, relaxing, experiencing the whole body breathing, experiencing the whole

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
body breathing.

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,440
So now I'm paying attention to the whole body.

133
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,040
Well, basically you're just keeping it, keeping it active, keeping it, keeping it, keeping

134
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,920
it active to remain mindful of your very evolution, because the moment you slip into a method

135
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,880
or technique you're done, mindfulness cannot be there.

136
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,400
It also doesn't mean that every next breath you have to do differently, all those are just

137
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,360
listed the ways you can be doing it while remaining mindful, and then within that mindfulness

138
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:18,760
of the general kind of of the fact, of the general fact that you're being undermined

139
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,760
basically by the nature of your life's dependence upon breath, you cannot access that.

140
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:33,120
You can be breathing as softly, smoothly and as controlling as you can be, but the dependence,

141
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,520
the phenomenon that your life depends upon it on the presence of that breath, that's

142
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,920
something you cannot control, that's just there, and if that changes, no matter if you're

143
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,520
breathing will keep your life.

144
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,920
Think of it like, you keep breathing normally, but suddenly there is no oxygen where you're

145
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,880
breathing, you're breathing some, I don't know, carbon dioxide.

146
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,360
You're still breathing, but you're not actually going to be alive for much longer despite

147
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,520
your same evolution, same effort, same everything, but this external circumstance, this external

148
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,840
form that your life depends upon has changed, and you cannot have an input in there.

149
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,640
You cannot breathe in such a manner to maintain your life, so to speak, despite the absence

150
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,040
of oxygen in there you're breathing.

151
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,040
In other words, the aspects of which your life depends are actually a control, but not

152
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,920
knowing that clearly enough, the notion of control that you have, or rather the notion

153
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,720
of evolution that we have, that we can exercise, induce the notion of ultimate control, so

154
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,680
you think you're breathing because you're alive, because your life is in your control,

155
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,720
and then if you suddenly end up somewhere there is no oxygen to breathe in, if all that

156
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,200
is unfortunate, incident or something, but the fact is that such things are possible means

157
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,000
that your life is rooted outside of your control, because if you are truly in your control,

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,160
no incident or accidents could happen to you of any kind.

159
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,280
I mean breath, obviously, is the most personal action you're doing, so that's why it's

160
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,880
a good way to reveal this, because really, your whole life, like you can be breathing

161
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,520
and breathing, but okay, forget about it, and actually say you don't know any chemistry

162
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,760
and stuff, so you don't think about oxygen or carbon dioxide or anything else, just

163
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,320
have the phenomena, like mindfulness of the clear air passage in your body, that's

164
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,720
where your life depends on, and if something obstructs it internally, your life's ending,

165
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,280
done, and you have not say in it.

166
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,920
If your heart stops pumping, no one breathing can help you, if your lungs get constricted

167
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,880
or collapse or something, you're done, if something just blocks these tubes, you're done,

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,320
and you're a great volition of this, like that, it's all secondary to it, and that's

169
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,800
what you want to see.

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
It extends.

171
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,320
Hence, you do mindfulness rightly, full dispassion, full recognition of death, the nature

172
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,800
of death, and the urgency, the urgency is automatic.

173
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,320
You see the full extent of your control, as still being secondary to the fact that you

174
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,320
depend upon that, which is not in your control, so you see your control has not been in your

175
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
control.

176
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:41,800
And that's why I'm going to give that, as an alternative to a subarm, not a musatian

177
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
song.

178
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:52,880
My answer to any of this also is, like, you know, let's say, Maran and Lucidie, obviously,

179
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,840
if you're just trying to do it off the bat, you still have all the other assumptions,

180
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,680
you know, other things, I present a lot of them, like, I assume material in my thoughts

181
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,520
or whatever kind of change there, and that's why I think you're trying to do us to come

182
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
first.

183
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,440
Oh, yeah, well, you know, that's what we assumed in this talk, now, I hope you can do

184
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,320
anything wrongly, anyway, so basically, yeah, you need to have the wrong view, and then

185
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,360
if you do it like this, it will be, it will lead to the result of full dispassion, you

186
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,560
won't lead you in itself, in the same sense, if you do Maran, Maran sati correctly, yeah,

187
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,080
it will lead you to our engine, but if you don't do it correctly, you won't.

188
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:39,720
Lisa, I'm going to suggest with that, basically, it's also the same principle, basically,

189
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,960
you get more and more, see the general level of your experience, in what way, would you

190
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,800
just see that bridging and ring out, basically, there's information that we see for the

191
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
feelings and then the mind.

192
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,240
Sure, yeah, as I said before, you can't do it, that doesn't mean you have to, every next

193
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,920
breath, do it differently, you can just be breathing, as long as you're breathing mindfully.

194
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,000
Is it a matter of choice for five?

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,800
No, the point is to maintain the mindfulness of that principle, no, like going far with

196
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
some repetition or something.

197
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,280
And if you're just sort of feeling fine, you're just sort of mind fine.

198
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,200
As long as the mindfulness is sort of slipping, or you're getting whatever, or you don't

199
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,400
have any of the same sharpness, or you're not maintaining the same vision of the expression

200
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,560
and your life, depending upon its fellow circumstances, right there, simultaneously present

201
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,800
with you controlling your breath and so on, controlling in a sense of intentional, evolationally

202
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,880
breathing in and out, then, yeah, then you keep it, that's what I said, you keep it active,

203
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,200
and you don't change it up, and you just introduce more, to engage you more, to keep your

204
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
mind for more.

205
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,640
And then the sutra continues all the way to the dispassion, evolation, and your other,

206
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,240
almost feels like it's stages, and then it then goes to the stage of...

207
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,800
Well, everything is presented like the stages, as I said.

208
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,520
The casinos are presented as stages, but they're not stages in that manner.

209
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,280
Exactly, so how far you can take it, and that's where the results to, but you don't have

210
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
to take it that far.

211
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,320
Like, as I said, the first journey is sufficient for our energy, because that's already the

212
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,360
principle of establishment of the mind, rightly, or you can go all the four.

213
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,280
So this is the same, but that's the whole point.

214
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,480
The four foundations of mindfulness gets fully developed, and the one who does the unappreciated

215
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,480
rightly, and then the dispassion, and this is a journey, and this is the result of that.

216
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,360
So we're just more like, absolute personal inclination, yeah, and you can also choice

217
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
towards...

218
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
It is choice, yeah.

219
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Yeah.

220
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Yeah.

221
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Because, yeah, if you think you get tired, or start to talk, then you need something more

222
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,360
particularly, because just for breathing in general, you know, breathing, thinking of your

223
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,060
body, breathing, looking at your mind, like, get more involved in that sense, or just

224
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,880
breathing right now, if you're mindful enough, but mindful enough in regard to the principle

225
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,000
of your life, depending upon that, which is an artinial control, while you're breathing

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,520
there, and then...

227
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
So...

228
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,680
Notion theory, notion abstraction, right there, while I'm breathing in, while I'm breathing

229
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:19,320
out, start discerning that external direction, so to speak, you can't see that domain upon

230
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,680
which your life depends, because there will only be a form of accessing that domain.

231
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,760
You just have a recognition that this radioactive breathing that is keeping your life and your

232
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,280
body functioning and everything else is basically liable to things that are not in your control

233
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,840
thus, your life is liable to things that are not in your control thus, your life cannot

234
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,840
be in your control thus, you having a passion and desire towards anything that's dependent

235
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,480
upon their life, are your senses, your sensuality, sensual desires, satisfaction, pleasures,

236
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
cannot possibly occur.

237
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,320
I think one of the general things people use to send their practice to do is they feel

238
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,800
like the meditation is successful or I study successful and it's pleasant, as you can

239
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,920
feel it's a different pleasant than doing something wrong.

240
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:13,920
I find it because an instruction for suggestion is, I breathe in, experiencing venture,

241
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,120
especially joy, as they're feeding session, so you kind of have an argument to see that

242
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
you feel good.

243
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Why?

244
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,800
Because if you look at the other things, then you might be jumping over cliffs, like I

245
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
stay dead.

246
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,960
Well, intentionally look at the, because it doesn't matter actually, still the nature

247
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
of the feeling is there.

248
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,160
So yeah, intentionally keep your body calm, focus on the rapture and stuff, why are you maintaining

249
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,600
the principle of death in your life not being in your control?

250
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,560
Because otherwise, you might sort of make the mind decide, oh, I had enough of this and

251
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,600
then I'm still thinking that they're done.

252
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,840
But yeah, important of being always letting, I don't know, experiencing rapture, no, I'm

253
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,560
just going to go into it, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, the

254
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:09,560
pleasure is not any measure whatsoever of your progress, it's basically that kind of

255
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:17,560
inshakable, unshakable nature of the composure and the peace in the face of death, which is

256
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:24,080
not pleasant, but that this pleasure cannot overwhelm your mind and that's pleasant.

257
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,440
But if you're just looking out to some sort of rapture, or rapture and excitement or something

258
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,080
while you're looking more at least, well, you're certainly using it out for the long reasons.

259
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Yeah, or if you look at it at the end, the contemplating phenomenon, things like impermanence,

260
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,080
I don't know if they use it in each of them, but that's it.

261
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,880
Well, they were using Sajipatana, and it does say that Sajipatana will be brought to

262
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,880
you if you look at it in quality of it, in each of them.

263
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
No.

264
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,880
While you're being converted, cessation or de-creation, is the idea that one works, is it?

265
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
But decreasing or intensifying?

266
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Yeah.

267
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
They are rising and falling, whatever.

268
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,880
I was ceasing and then disfession, you know.

269
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:30,880
There's the revolution and the liberation, the delinquishing's detachment.

270
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,880
And there are many more students, like when it says highly experienced delinquishing and detachment

271
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,880
or dispassion and revulsion, but seeing that it's horrible, it's perilous, it's dangerous,

272
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
it's a trap.

273
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
So the mind pulls away from it, turns away from it.

274
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Like a man being carried to a pit full of burning ambers.

275
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,880
He might as well be in every other direction except there was burning ambers.

276
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,880
He wants to be everywhere else except there.

277
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,880
And that's what Anabalusati provides you with, if that's right or not.

278
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Because it is the very core of your experience, so to speak, given spatially speaking,

279
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,880
like the breathing, the center of your body, the center of your...

280
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Well, so it appears, the center of your point of view, the center of me.

281
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,880
So basically, you are prudent from right there.

282
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,880
And then there's nothing you can take.

283
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,880
As yours, once you've given up, the ownership of your breath through a stringent system.

284
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
But...

285
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Exactly.

286
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Through seeing that your control, your intention is only very relative,

287
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,880
and given, which means it's not fundamentally your control.

288
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
So that's the wrong...

289
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
You might feel...

290
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Yeah, the point is in the right order.

291
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,880
My sense of screenings, pointings in the right order.

292
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Seeing where the breath, your control is rooted.

293
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Yeah.

294
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:05,880
The body, element, whatever, or experience, it's feelings being there, mind being there.

295
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Yeah.

296
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,880
So, as you said the other day, it's not being...

297
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,880
It's coming from a different direction.

298
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,880
That intention itself is not...

299
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,880
It's not created independently by myself.

300
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Right.

301
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Exactly.

302
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
I see ways come from...

303
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Right.

304
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Then you see that whatever else is here, on biggest, in general,

305
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,880
in not clear, in vague,

306
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,880
which is the same nature as everything, or these things that are understood.

307
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
So you don't have to chase your sense of self.

308
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
You get...

309
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,880
You get surfacted by that kind of blanket application of that principle.

310
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Yeah.

311
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I'll give that example before I can't do politics.

312
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
You don't necessarily...

313
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
No.

314
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,880
I don't know.

315
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Which bacteria is sort of causing the problem by taking the general one.

316
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,880
You know, well, whatever it was, it was also affected by this.

317
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,880
But that's only possible when you have the right principle.

318
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
That's why the right view has to come first.

319
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,880
You can't just be doing mindfulness of breathing and expecting.

320
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
I mean, you should be trying, anyway.

321
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,880
You know, even conclusion should be trying to understand things.

322
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Understand the nature of satipatana, understand the nature of feelings,

323
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
the nature of suffering, the nature of freedom from it.

324
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Yeah, absolutely.

325
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
But don't fool yourself about it.

326
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
You cannot do it rightly if you know what right away it is.

327
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Yeah, you can.

328
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
I did that.

329
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
I did that.

330
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I did that.

331
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Closer you go.

332
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Yeah.

333
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
It is a degree of trial and error.

334
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Yeah.

335
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,880
That's why again, as I said, the closest comes to some sort of method,

336
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
this constant strike.

337
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Relentless.

338
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,880
And even you're resting, don't give up the mindfulness.

339
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,880
So, if you're resting, don't give up the mindfulness.

340
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,880
So, if you're resting, don't give up the mindfulness.

341
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,880
If you're resting, don't give up the mindfulness.

342
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,880
So, it's turning, it's seeing the structure correctly.

343
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,880
All the other things, correctly, but where everything's rooted,

344
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,880
it's pushing that center out of center.

345
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Well, it's just an armating.

346
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,880
It's just, I mean, the center, faith is well gone.

347
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Like the notion of center cannot even be conceived anymore.

348
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,880
The notion of I am the center.

349
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,880
That's why that sort of one cannot think like the Tujan anymore.

350
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,880
He can remember around the world, but he can't think like...

351
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,880
He was going to think that the center is over there.

352
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
No, no, no, no.

353
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Because in order for you to center something,

354
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,880
means you need to have what you need to have the space around it

355
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
to put it in a center.

356
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
But his whole direction is out of your control.

357
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
And you can't even access it.

358
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Thus, whenever the center might be, it's on the other side.

359
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Which means it's not really a center,

360
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
because there will only require the assumption of certain space.

361
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,880
And this precedes that.

362
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
So then it's just center less.

363
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
I eat self less.

364
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Yeah, that's where you get your idea.

365
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,880
It was, you know, whatever's in front.

366
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
It's just, however far you go,

367
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,880
it can never be yours.

368
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
No, yeah, yeah.

369
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Well, basically, the front behind up and down

370
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,880
before or after all of that

371
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
is already secondary to that,

372
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
because of which your life is there,

373
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
determined as it is,

374
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,880
to that upon which your life depends.

375
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
And even you have a notion of my life depends upon something.

376
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
That's already within that,

377
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
upon which your life depends.

378
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
In other words, any spatial direction,

379
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,880
any time application,

380
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
I thought, it's already within that.

381
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
And there is no outside of it

382
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
that you can possibly conceive.

383
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,880
There is no outside of the five aggregates.

384
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,880
So what you can do is experience this passion towards it,

385
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
because you know that it's liable to things

386
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
that are not in your control,

387
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
because of which this,

388
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
which is your in control,

389
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
is in your control,

390
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
it's not really in your control,

391
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
because if you were,

392
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,880
you would be controlling its fate as one.

393
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
It's the same principle,

394
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
like the body is liable to sickness,

395
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
thus it's not mine.

396
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Like, anybody, everyone understands their thoughts,

397
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,880
in a way, to a degree.

398
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
But it's, if you really,

399
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
to understand their thoughts,

400
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
you would fully let go of sensuality

401
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,880
and become ungodly.

402
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
It's the same thought.

403
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,880
It's just taken to a different extent.

404
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
So, they, their thoughts,

405
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
and paired with their alanseness,

406
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
drilling, and not resting.

407
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
And yet, you'll be free from sensuality,

408
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
even as a protugina.

409
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,880
That's how they're likely to remain protugina.

410
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Because you have plenty of down-instruction around you.

411
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
And it's the same principle

412
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
that you apply to the mind,

413
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
the notion of space,

414
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
the notion of time,

415
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
the notion of thoughts,

416
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
intentions, again,

417
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,880
rooted,

418
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
or rather depend upon that,

419
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
which you cannot even conceive of,

420
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
think of.

421
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
Because of that,

422
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,880
so do you.

423
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
You, you, you, you, you,

424
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
you still use it,

425
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
but you have, uh,

426
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
but enough extinguished

427
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
any notions of ownership

428
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
in regard to it.

429
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
In the same sense,

430
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
you extinguish the

431
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,880
any notion of ownership

432
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
in regard to the book,

433
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,880
and what both it provides.

434
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
And we're also in the other nights,

435
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
like, I was in a,

436
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
in the car,

437
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
I'm not doing any in the car.

438
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Car manipulation.

439
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Existing.

440
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Existing.

441
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
No, yeah.

442
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
Yeah, it's closed.

443
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
They're just feeding the car,

444
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
moving past all.

445
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Yeah, moving.

446
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
And,

447
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
because it's,

448
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
it's really, uh,

449
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
political.

450
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Oh, yeah.

451
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
And feeling of,

452
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
you could get it.

453
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
And the mind automatically was,

454
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I'm, I'm moving away from this.

455
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Yeah.

456
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
Yeah.

457
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
The mind doesn't want to think that,

458
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
because it's,

459
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
it's threatening.

460
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
Because the mind is still

461
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
driven by fear,

462
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
or can be driven by fear,

463
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
or it doubts

464
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
whether it can be driven by fear.

465
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
So it fears it,

466
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
which means it's driven by fear.

467
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
If my doubts,

468
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
whether the fear can penetrate it,

469
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
it's penetrated by fear.

470
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
The doubt,

471
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
cause,

472
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
like, created the bridge,

473
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
so to speak.

474
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
But the only way to free yourself,

475
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
in doubt,

476
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
is to train your mind

477
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
in regard to fear.

478
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
So maybe,

479
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
I don't,

480
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
I don't know,

481
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,880
this is different fear.

482
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
I mean, like,

483
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
when you see the possibility,

484
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
uh-huh.

485
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
You see,

486
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
when I see it,

487
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
if I'm here,

488
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
hey, this is me.

489
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
That's a problem.

490
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Oh, right, right.

491
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Well,

492
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
if I get answered,

493
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
speak detached.

494
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Oh, I see.

495
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
Yeah, mind from that.

496
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Right.

497
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Is there any?

498
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
There is just,

499
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
there is an experience,

500
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
in a sense of,

501
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
yeah, a very dangerous

502
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
parenthesis,

503
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
close to that experience.

504
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
But even that,

505
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
it's not mine.

506
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Yes, I guess.

507
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Well, if you stick to that,

508
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
even when you're not just in the car,

509
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
you,

510
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
you would be basically practicing

511
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
this passion correctly,

512
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
which means sooner or later,

513
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
it would take root

514
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
more and more,

515
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
and become self-apparent.

516
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Yeah,

517
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
it's also very well

518
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
back to the breath.

519
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
You know,

520
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
I was saying,

521
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
what is crucial,

522
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
actually,

523
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
feeling unpleasant feeling?

524
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
To me,

525
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
then, actually,

526
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
it feels kind of,

527
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
firstly,

528
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
you can do a mindfulness,

529
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
and it's not so much like,

530
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
I feel certain,

531
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
that I'm feeling,

532
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
which is just mindfulness

533
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
becomes like,

534
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
the feeling is present.

535
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Yeah.

536
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
And also, when you were

537
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
talking about, like,

538
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
the dying process,

539
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
everything is slightly

540
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
the body is shutting down,

541
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
like, everything becomes

542
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
unpleasant,

543
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
and the mind moves away

544
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
from anything

545
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
unpleasant,

546
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
and I don't know,

547
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
certain body parts,

548
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
you know,

549
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
just drones,

550
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
and then it should,

551
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
even the breathing becomes,

552
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
well, even the mind,

553
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
even the thought itself becomes

554
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
unpleasant,

555
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
and that's why, like,

556
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
the dying man has only

557
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
wisdom to rely upon,

558
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
if he has developed it,

559
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
if he hasn't,

560
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
he would be an ultimate

561
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
despair,

562
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
which is why that is so hard,

563
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
and difficult,

564
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
as an experience.

565
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
But wisdom,

566
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
not being dependent upon any,

567
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
any phenomena,

568
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
upon the basic,

569
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
on six senses,

570
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
but it's in regard to the

571
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
six senses,

572
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
the five senses in the mind,

573
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
that's what it says,

574
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
that's where the

575
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
peace is,

576
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
that's where the equilibrium is,

577
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
that's where not fear,

578
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
lack of fear is,

579
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
that's where our

580
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
energy is really,

581
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
our energy is really,

582
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
so death,

583
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
no death,

584
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
makes no difference,

585
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
mind doesn't pick on anything,

586
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
doesn't intrude

587
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
anything,

588
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
so it doesn't get reborn,

589
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
done?

590
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
As with the thinking,

591
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
like,

592
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
sometimes we're talking about

593
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
a peaceful death,

594
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
actually,

595
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
all we do is

596
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
like,

597
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
and the death has to be

598
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
unpleasant.

599
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Well,

600
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
the only peaceful death

601
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
is

602
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Farraham's death.

603
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Yes.

604
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
There's no such thing

605
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
as peace from death.

606
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
No, that's one,

607
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
isn't it?

608
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Yes.

609
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Some people say,

610
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
though,

611
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
I'm a child about

612
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
how to prepare people

613
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
to have a peaceful death.

614
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I'm

615
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
just saying,

616
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
if anyone correctly,

617
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
he also saw the

618
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
peace,

619
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
just about to be

620
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
slaughtered with a smile

621
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
on the face.

622
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
So,

623
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
we just appear

624
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
well,

625
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
this

626
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
doesn't

627
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
move

628
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
at this moment.

629
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Just something

630
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
that's

631
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
different.

632
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
You know,

633
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
the experience of the

634
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
body,

635
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
we're talking about

636
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
content being

637
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
pressure,

638
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
isn't it?

639
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
So, it could be,

640
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
like, the body

641
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
pressure,

642
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
okay,

643
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
and feelings

644
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
could use it to

645
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
touch it,

646
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
to touch it,

647
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
experience.

648
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
As

649
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
a musical

650
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
sound,

651
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
I don't

652
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
know.

653
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:31,880
I just

654
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
can't

655
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
I just thought

656
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
of that word,

657
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
but it's like

658
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
the thing is, yeah.

659
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
I mean,

660
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
maybe it means for

661
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
something more,

662
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
but someone

663
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
is a

664
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
designation.

665
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
I don't know.

666
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
He's a

667
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
problem

668
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
I have to

669
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
qualify.

670
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Maybe

671
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
I'll think

672
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
of that more,

673
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
but he has feelings

674
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
more.

675
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
So, I don't

676
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
experience.

677
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Well,

678
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
you can,

679
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
you can,

680
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
but it doesn't

681
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
mean that for you,

682
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,880
it doesn't

683
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
stand closer

684
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
to that which

685
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
feeling is,

686
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
then if you

687
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
is designation

688
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
feeling.

689
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
So, yeah.

690
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
It's fine.

691
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Call it

692
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
whatever you want

693
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
with it.

694
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
The mind

695
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
being

696
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
shaped.

697
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Well, sure.

698
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Yeah.

699
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
The general

700
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
is

701
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
as it takes it.

702
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Yeah.

703
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
It's

704
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
abundant pressure.

705
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
But,

706
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
but one thing,

707
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
like, I'm,

708
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
well, I'm

709
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
going to say,

710
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
yes, you don't

711
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
mean that, but I think

712
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
it's just useful to

713
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
call it.

714
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Like, when you say

715
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
mind is a

716
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
shape, that doesn't,

717
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
doesn't mean

718
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
you can see that

719
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
shape externally.

720
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
It means you just

721
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
find that

722
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
shape.

723
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Find

724
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
the experience

725
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
shape.

726
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Which means that's

727
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
what the mind is at

728
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
time.

729
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
You can't have

730
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
step outside the mind.

731
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
You see the mind is

732
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
such.

733
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Like, all

734
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
my mind is such

735
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
shape.

736
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
No, excuse me.

737
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Yeah.

738
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
No, I'm not taking

739
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
external view

740
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
and saying this.

741
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
Yeah.

742
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Yeah.

743
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Yeah.

744
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Yeah.

745
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
So you can't

746
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
describe it.

747
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Sure.

748
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Yeah.

749
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
And that's what's

750
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
out the colonel does.

751
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
He knows his mind.

752
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
As expanded mind.

753
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
As struck me.

754
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
As depressed mind.

755
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
As enlightened mind.

756
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
As light mind.

757
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
As heavy mind.

758
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Whatever.

759
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Because you can use

760
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:17,880
very general

761
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
designations because

762
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
those you can't

763
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
have more particular

764
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
ones.

765
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Could be if I'm

766
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
saying I'm

767
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
paying attention to

768
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
that.

769
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
That's why I'm trying

770
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
just.

771
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Well, I'm not.

772
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Just editing what

773
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
arises.

774
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Is it right?

775
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Good.

776
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Good.

777
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Very thoroughly.

778
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
And seeing that as

779
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
the approach

780
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
is the foundation

781
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,880
for the measurements

782
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
of this attention

783
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:28,880
to breathe,

784
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
calmly.

785
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Okay.

786
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Maybe I get it.

787
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Yep.

788
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
And so, wherever

789
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:51,880
arises.

790
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
So, when I'm looking

791
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:05,400
shape to make this shape. I'm looking at my intention. And I can see the shape around

792
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:14,880
it. So you discern the shape as a given one. Yeah, yeah. But on a more, on a more

793
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:23,000
practical, it's probably a bit more useful for why the audience, I guess, would be, not

794
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,480
getting too abstract about this shape, but just discerning the shape, or rather discerning

795
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:36,480
the mind affected by sensuality. Well, discerning the mind, not affected by sensuality, discerning

796
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,600
the mind affected by the will, discerning the mind, not affected by the will, discerning

797
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:54,760
the mind affected by delusion, by non-delusion. That's kind of very fundamental. Discerning

798
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:04,320
the mind affected by pleasure, affected by displeasure. Because none of those shapes of the mind

799
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:15,100
responded to this, so that are kind of impersonal, so to speak. They're all being felt. I had a

800
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:20,360
pleasure in the Quran, but whether it's a pleasure caused by the peace, freedom, or it's a pleasure

801
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:27,040
caused by the prospect of sensuality, elation, delight, which means it's a pleasure really.

802
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,580
So you want to see that, because like you might not be engaging in any sensual acts, you

803
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:39,000
might be well-restrained, but the mind is still affected by the possibility of sensual

804
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,520
pleasure that you are welcoming. So you want to be stopped. You want to stop the welcoming.

805
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,520
You want to undermine the possibility of pleasure affecting you. You can't undermine

806
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:59,840
the possibility of pleasure. You can't undermine eyes seeing things that they will find

807
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,900
agreeable. Here's hearing sounds that they will find agreeable, for as long as you have

808
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,640
eyes ears and other senses. What you can do is, on the level of their mind, free your

809
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:15,960
mind from the welcoming and delighting in the possibility of being so. And then, whatever

810
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,520
is particularly, you can't give in. Because possibilities are more general, more fundamental

811
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,720
than the particular arising of any of them. So if your mind is free from possibility

812
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,720
of delighting in pleasure, you cannot actually delight in any pleasure right there and then.

813
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:40,040
So you have been dispassionates in regards to? That's what I expect is a lot of kindness,

814
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:49,640
for example, the matter you say. Basically, you have surmounted the possibility of your

815
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,920
mind giving in to the will. Welcome in your will. They can join your will. Engaging in

816
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,520
your will. You have removed that. Thus, automatically, your experiencing meant indirectly, your

817
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:11,120
experience meant, you're not forcing anything. So, layer. You, you, you, the focus of attention

818
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,800
of your breathing or whatever. And when you see the peripheral sort of experiences,

819
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,480
a whole notion of the mind there, see, is there liable to sensuality? Like, if you have

820
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,920
sensual thought now, will it cause the delight and excitement? And welcoming. Yeah, that's

821
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,120
where the problem is. So you want to remove that on that peripheral level. But if I'm

822
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,440
not delighting. Yeah, you can remove the actual possibility where you can remove your delight

823
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,480
in it. And if you stop delighting the possibility of sensuality, you cannot possibly engage in

824
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,480
it then in it actually. But in particular. I mean, my mind is breathing is doing any way

825
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,280
to just focus on it. Yeah, yeah. I know. I'm just, you started talking about the mind

826
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,880
and the shape of it. And I'm just telling you rather than there is a risk of getting lost

827
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,880
in abstract if you start sort of drawing lines and shapes and stuff. I mean, it, for some

828
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,480
people, it might work in the same manner, but the point is dispassion. The point is non-sensuality.

829
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,960
So if you're thinking about the shapes of your mind, it should lead to dispassion. If it's

830
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,560
not, you're not thinking about it. You can't just do dispassion. Well, you could theoretically,

831
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,440
if you say no on the right peripheral level. Peripherally, if you say no. Not just if you

832
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,600
say no actually, and then hope that everything else will get affected by it. Okay, yeah,

833
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:38,880
when you're talking about peripherals, proper minds. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not involved

834
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:46,720
in that. Yeah. Yeah. No, but you're probably seeing it. Peripherally renouncement. I might

835
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:53,040
fully see it and might fully renounce it. This isn't it? Possibility. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

836
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:00,240
The distance, whether in the mind is actually good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is it still liable

837
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,960
to it? Because you are responsible for that. You know, responsible for eyes, finding certain

838
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,480
things agreeable, certain things disagreeable. But you are responsible for maintaining the

839
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,680
notions of delight and assumptions in your mind, which then keep the minds susceptible

840
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,120
and liable to changes of weather, changes of mood, of sexuality, of your will, of delusion,

841
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:31,720
of complacency. That's a new. So when the mind is bright and mindful, you look at the

842
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:37,480
nature of that and then try to sort of spread, so to speak, on that peripheral level,

843
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,480
that nature further and further and further, until you can understand how it can become

844
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:50,320
impanetrable to the possibility of sexuality. You cannot prevent possibility of sexuality

845
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,680
arising and manifesting itself, but you can certainly train your mind to turn away

846
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,440
from it, to stop delighting it, stop welcoming it, stop assuming it as good.

847
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:09,600
So the possibility always comes first before the actual engagement. Sure. Well, not comes

848
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,240
first in the sense of first, second, the single thing is present with the actual engagement,

849
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:20,040
but it precedes it more generally. It's more fundamental because it does. Yeah. Just

850
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:28,560
not delighting in that. Yeah. So you know, nothing specific, nothing specific, just the

851
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:37,760
possibility of enjoying pleasure based upon body. That's it. Don't go there. No, no, no,

852
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,560
no, no, no, no, no. It's not like going there or not going there. That thing has already

853
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,880
risen, so you just like stop welcoming that, stop regarding it as much and stop finding

854
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:58,120
it agreeable. Stop not seeing it as dangerous. Because you're not seeing it as dangerous,

855
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:04,400
automatically, you're welcoming it. But only how to see it as dangerous, you are not

856
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:12,120
welcoming. Not more than that man will welcome the pitful burning embers. That's often in

857
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,480
the source of the danger we can apparent and the mind will liberate it. Because the danger

858
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,440
is there. It's actual dangerous. You're not contriving, you're not fabricating any danger.

859
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,920
You might have to do so initially so they can correspond to the actual danger that can

860
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:39,360
then be discerned. But it is actually dangerous. Laughter and dangerous. Just essential thought,

861
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:47,760
let alone essential action. Because it's, yeah, it's crap, it's the story of wisdom. No,

862
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,000
because it's dangerous. That's it. You don't have to give reasons. Well, all that is

863
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,080
in the level of reasoning, which means all that is not directly seeing the danger. You

864
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,040
want to see the danger as danger. Then you can reason only one. Not only that. So think

865
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,200
about the phenomenon of danger. How do I get there as a danger to your life now, right

866
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,400
here? How would you feel? That's how you should feel when the sensual thought arises,

867
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,100
in the same manner. Like your life is on the line.

868
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,000
Sensual thought, not any thought, not any agreeable thought. Just a thought pertaining to the

869
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,360
pleasure based upon body. You're going to become neurotic about it either in the sense

870
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:32,400
of like nothing, a javelinous accept, and everything is dangerous. Yeah. Yeah, all

871
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,600
some things are. No, if the demand is, no thinking, no, no thinking, any, any essential

872
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:48,280
things, any is at the same time, withdrawing itself from being, from being sort of allowable

873
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,600
to the touch or the possibility of the sensual things, basically, it cannot be touched by

874
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:00,640
the possibilities either, even if they are arising, even on the level of mind, a thought of pleasure,

875
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,720
doesn't pull them on towards their pleasure. That's fine. You don't have to keep pressing

876
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:12,080
it further. Keep it there. This was there. Stand it there. That's actually the first

877
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:24,440
question. So when I say the surmounting, the possibilities of sensual pleasure, that's

878
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,880
what the suitors, when they talk about preventing the other reason and wholesome states from

879
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,680
arising. You prevent them by not delighting in the possibility of them. Basically, other

880
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:43,080
reason and wholesome states are the possibilities of the sensuality, which is unwholesome, are

881
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:49,880
the possibilities of unwholesome, be it sensuality or your work. So another reason unwholesome

882
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,240
equals possibility of unwholesome. And that's where you basically, on that level, you free

883
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,320
your mind from it. And if the mind is free on the level of the other reason states of

884
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:08,360
unwholesome nature, then the mind cannot be controlled, touched or engaged with the states

885
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:16,880
that are actually right in front of you for a reason. And the maintenance of wholesome

886
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:24,280
states. Again, it's again easy in regards to the unwholesome state. The possibility of

887
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,200
the wholesome state, that's what you're training in regard to. And that's how you maintain

888
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:36,760
the actual reason wholesome states. As seen in a danger, seeing the precise gratification.

889
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:43,080
Well, see the danger in being liable to the arising of the unwholesome states of unwholesome

890
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:52,280
nature. See the danger in the possibility of unwholesome affecting you.

891
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:58,560
You actually gratification. And the sure, in there is a month. Yeah. Yeah. Would you be

892
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:05,560
deriving the possibility of unwholesome? Delighting. Well, not in a sensual manner. In order

893
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:11,760
to welcome. Well, not deriving is the also. Yeah, exactly. You might want it, but then

894
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,840
wanting will be on the level of wisdom. Like wanting eyes and recognizing this is liberation,

895
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:23,840
this is the free, this is escape. Yeah, chandelier. Yeah, exactly. You can go both ways. See.
