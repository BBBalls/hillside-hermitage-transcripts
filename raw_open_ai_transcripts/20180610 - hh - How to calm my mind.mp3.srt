1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So I feel distracted most of the time, and my mind can never really settle down.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So how can I calm my mind down?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The first step is putting yourself in the calmer environment.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In other words, no matter how strong your resolve is to calm your mind,

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
if you are in the middle of interaction, engagement with others, with duties, with noise, visuals, you won't become.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So the wisdom lies in preventing these things from disturbing your peace,

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so you want to see it ahead before you are in such an environment.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Or if you already are, you want to see that it's necessary, not just beneficial.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you want to calm your mind, it is necessary to step outside of that environment, even temporarily.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So you want to calm down the circumstances around you, isolate yourself more from it.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then, on the basis of that, you can start practicing mindfulness

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and basically trying to understand what makes calm mind calm.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's how you get the knowledge, and that's how you calm your mind.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're not in the midst.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, no, of course not.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Later on, obviously, when your mind is calmer and when you are stronger,

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
then you might end up in circumstances that are not calm but remain unaffected,

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
but not until your mind grew out of it.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Imagine like, I don't know, you catch some infectious disease.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And the first step is to get out of that environment,

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
because the environment is infecting you and just causing you to be constantly sick.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So then you have to spend a certain amount of time in a non-infected environment.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And then when you cure, you develop resistance, then you can go back, if you have to, to the infected environment.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You won't be affected again.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But it's the same if you want to calm down your mind and develop it.
