1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
So I thought we could just about celibacy, sexuality, since it's quite an important point

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,360
for most people who are practicing most monastics anyway.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:34,480
And I'll be reading from the Anguitori Nikaia, the numerical discourses of the Buddha.

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,040
The Buddha, he says in the beginning, the book of the One, actually.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,960
Because I do not see even one other form that sort of obsesses the mind of a man as the

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,080
form of a woman, the form of a woman obsesses the mind of a man.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:08,040
Likewise vice versa for a woman, to the form of a woman, the smell, the whole experience

8
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,360
of a woman obsesses one's every sense base, the form, the smell, the fact that it is,

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:24,160
he says those who are bound by the sense of touch, are thoroughly bound.

10
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,240
So once you can have the image of the see the woman, but once you have the touch, they

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,480
had experienced that behind you thoroughly.

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
The last drop.

13
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,520
Yes, the last thing.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,840
And then he goes, another suitor goes on to say, because there are three things that

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:55,480
give no sayation or are insatiable by indulging in them, what's three?

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:04,120
By indulging in sleep, by indulging in alcohol, and by indulging in sexual intercourse.

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,320
These are three things that give no sayation by indulging in them.

18
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:18,880
There's no ending to the desire, to the desire and more specifically in regard to those

19
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,960
three things.

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,760
You can never have enough of it.

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:38,640
Well, most people would feel like they already know that, and the desires are not, cannot

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:47,280
be really satisfied and so on, but if you were, obviously if you really understand it,

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,440
if you were to generally understand it, that it's insatiable, then you would actually lose

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,440
an interest in it, then all this is, this is inherently structurally, countless, impossible

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:14,040
to, the promise that it has, whatever satisfaction, getting pleasure is just, it is hollow, then

26
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:23,400
it's fact, so it cannot be satisfied, which means, okay, so given in one's means, then

27
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,720
it will be hard for you to not give in another time, and you give in another time, then

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,480
it will be hard for you to not give in again, and so it will develop a habit of giving

29
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,280
in to something that you know, it's utterly pointless.

30
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,760
So that's what, like even somebody who doesn't necessarily want one aims at all, and she

31
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,520
bests a goal, or on a cambio, or whatever, it will be better off like being celibate,

32
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,280
even as a layman, it will be much better off for the mind, for the general wisdom, for

33
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,120
general wholesomeness of life, and obviously for rebirth, because you spend your mind,

34
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,560
you spend your human life not engaging in animal-like, carnal activities, yeah, you're

35
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,760
going to have a better destination as a result of that, because what is it for, like getting

36
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
drunk?

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:26,560
There's absolutely no fulfilment, no goal, nothing, it's basically knowing that scratching

38
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,160
a ditch, want to remove the ditch, or you just enjoy the scratch, knowing that that scratch

39
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,120
is actually making the ditch even worse, it's the next time, it's going to reach you

40
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:50,640
even more, but you know, it's not even a temporary end to this comfort, it's just oblivion

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,480
through itching, that's making things worse, and then you depend on the ditch even more,

42
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,880
it means you depend on the living more, which means you're making things worse even

43
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:11,320
more, that's like the vicious circle and the downward spiral of sensuality, but some

44
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,520
would say that it's, it's only natural, it's actually only natural, and nature is what

45
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:29,920
is natural, nature keeps you bound to river, so yeah, it is very natural, it's very natural

46
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:38,600
to be reborn, it's very natural, someone said it's natural, but not necessary, sexual

47
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,280
intercourse, there's no, yeah, of course, which is the same, but again, I don't know what

48
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,160
context they meant, natural, some of these people, well people, when they say it's natural,

49
00:05:50,160 --> 00:06:00,280
nature, the design, it's kind of a whole great, a good thing, but it's not, ultimately, it

50
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,320
is the very nature, even the nature of things, and your ignorance in regard to it, it keeps

51
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,960
you bound, obviously you're responsible for that, you can't blame the nature of things,

52
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:19,960
but nature is set up as a trap, as a deceit, so that then you give in voluntarily, almost,

53
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,000
it's just easy, it's normal to take things at face value, it's normal to entertain ignorance

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,440
as you go to it, so that's what nature is, yeah, very much so, yeah, when people say

55
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,920
natural, then it's bad faith, it's not my fault, it's just, exactly, yeah, it's dismissing

56
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,560
on the responsibility, oh, it's natural, that's, it's not really up to me, it's just, it's

57
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,240
just natural to eat, they need the natural satisfaction, I guess, and there is also natural

58
00:06:49,240 --> 00:07:01,440
rebirth, a natural ignorance, a natural samsara, natural suffering, yeah, but there's, there's

59
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,520
three things, sleep, drugs, alcohol, sexual intercourse, yeah, it's just, they just, they

60
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:19,080
love each other, kind of thing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's all they're having,

61
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:33,440
so there's another sutra we'll read, it's called, it's from the Ingoodric Nikai as well,

62
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:44,520
and it's called Mother and Son, that's quite a intense sutra, yeah, yeah, yeah, another one,

63
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,040
one occasion, the blessed one was dwelling in Sarvati and Jators Grove, now on that occasion,

64
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,280
a mother and son, being respectively a Bikuni and a Biku, had entered the reigns residence

65
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,600
at Sarvati, they often wanted to see one another, the mother often wanted to see her son

66
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,760
and the son, his mother, because they often saw one another, a bond was formed, because

67
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:18,440
a bond formed intimacy arose, because there was intimacy lost in the old and open, with

68
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,200
their minds in the grip of lust, without having given up the training and declared their weakness,

69
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,040
they engaged in sexual intercourse, then a number of Bikus approached the blessed one, paid

70
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,280
homage to him, sat down to one side and reported what had happened, the blessed one said,

71
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,920
Bikus, the dead foolish man think, a mother does not fall in love with her son or a son

72
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,480
with his mother, because I do not see even one other form that is as tantalizing, sensuous

73
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,320
and intoxicating, captivating, infatuating, and as much of an obstacle to achieving the

74
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,720
unsurpassed security from bondage as the form of a woman, beings who are lustful for the

75
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,880
form of a woman, ravenous, tied to it, infatuated and blindly absorbed in it, sorrow for a long

76
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,080
time under the control of a woman's form, with the experience of a woman, because they

77
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:24,760
sound, they smell, they taste, they touch, Bikus, while walking, a woman obsesses the mind

78
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,800
of a man, while standing, while sitting, while laying down, while laughing, while speaking,

79
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,680
while singing, while crying, a woman obsesses the mind of a man, when swollen, too, a woman

80
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,480
obsesses the mind of a man, even when dead, a woman obsesses the mind of a man.

81
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,560
If Bikus, one could rightly say of anything, entirely a snare of mara, it is precisely

82
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,440
of a woman that one could say this, one might talk with a murderous foe, one might talk

83
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,200
with an evil spirit, one might even approach a viper, whose bite means certain death, but

84
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,080
was the woman, one to one, one should never talk, they bind one whose mind is muddled with

85
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,480
a glance and a smile, with their dress in disarray and with their gentle speech.

86
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,480
She is not safe to approach such a person, though she is swollen and dead.

87
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,520
These five objects of central pleasure are seen in a woman's body, form, sounds, tastes,

88
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:36,040
and odors, and also delightful touches, those swept up by the flood of sensuality, who

89
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,200
do not fully understand sensual pleasures, are plunged headlong into some sorrow, into

90
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,880
time, destination and existence upon existence.

91
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,840
For those who have fully understood sensual pleasures, live without fear from any quarter,

92
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,480
having attained the destruction of the taints, while in the world they have gone beyond.

93
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:07,760
And just to be said, it works the same way, for a woman, it is the form of a man, the

94
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:17,240
sex, you can just replace it, and I don't know when I have to address it, but I think some

95
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,840
people might, when they read things like that, obviously they read it with no wisdom or

96
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,680
not even enough transparency to see what they refer to, and then they take it personally,

97
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,200
and think the Buddha was blaming women, or the Buddha was blaming men, it wasn't.

98
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,760
So the nature of things is that you, with the mind affected with ignorance, will be snared

99
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,080
by a form of a woman.

100
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,360
Woman's mind, affected with ignorance, will be snared by a form of a man.

101
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,800
But that doesn't actually mean that that particular woman or that particular man are responsible

102
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,000
for that snare, they just carried this form.

103
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,640
Now they are responsible for their own ignorance in regard to their own form, they were given

104
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,000
to them, circumstantially.

105
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,960
So it kind of, it's not, it's not on the level of a full on clear volition that every woman

106
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,400
is out to get every man, or that every man is out to seduce an every woman.

107
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:26,520
No, simply by taking a masculine form, by assuming it, that's basically that masculine aspect

108
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,040
of it, which you yourself had nothing to do with, it was just given to you.

109
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:40,000
So in a way, a man is a victim of his own masculinity, as much as a woman is, that is being affected

110
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
by it.

111
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,120
Another woman is also a victim of her own femininity, as much as the man is snared by it.

112
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,520
And that's another subject that the Buddha says, by giving in to the notions of your own

113
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
masculinity.

114
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,120
And make yourself liable to be, basically, to be snared by the opposite, by the female,

115
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,840
by the feminine notions and feminine forms.

116
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,360
And same for a woman, by entertaining, by delighting in her femininity, she maintains herself

117
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,080
liable to a snare of a male form of the opposite.

118
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:21,160
It's one's own, doing one's own delighting, exactly, yeah, yeah.

119
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,600
The lust is found in your own mind, yeah, yeah.

120
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,280
So that, you can say that, but in this particular suit, that female form that snares a man, it's

121
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,800
the same female form that traps a woman.

122
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,720
And you can say that the male form that snares a woman, the masculinity, that snares a woman,

123
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,560
it's the same masculinity that traps a man.

124
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,240
So that's why, again, in another suit, you should look at your own body, at your own,

125
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,000
not delight in your masculinity as a man or a feminine, as a woman, and look at it as

126
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,440
with a disgust that you would look on a pile of feces on the road, you would avoid it,

127
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,040
you wouldn't step in it.

128
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,720
So you actually, in order to not be snared by a form of a woman, a man needs to actually

129
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,640
abandon the light and holding on to his masculinity.

130
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,840
It doesn't mean he needs to become feminine, which means he needs to not regard the given

131
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,600
masculinity as belonging to him.

132
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,200
He was given to no one, he has just a reason, and he will cease when the argument is

133
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
break apart.

134
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,120
There is no need for him to take it up and interfere with it, and the same goes for a woman.

135
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,440
Her femininity is a reason, it's a potential, it was given, whatever, determined by chance,

136
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,400
by elements, by previous lives, whatever, it's just how it is, and she's fully responsible

137
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,200
for taking it, and she will be fully responsible for freeing herself from it.

138
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,400
If she doesn't take it, it doesn't mean she has a sex change and becomes a man or something

139
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,120
like no, it just simply means whatever has a reason, you leave it as it is.

140
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:11,360
So then that femininity for a woman will not entrap her, and by not being entraped into

141
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,280
that, that is liable, basically, to be snared by the opposite, by the masculinity.

142
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,280
She won't be, she won't be snared by neither.

143
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,080
So you're responsible, a man is responsible for dwelling, for entertaining, for delighting,

144
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,200
for holding onto his masculinity, because of that, he's liable to snare, that sort of

145
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,080
comes and covers up that field of masculinity where he abides, carelessly.

146
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,760
If he were to withdraw his mind from that notion of masculinity, he can be very masculine externally,

147
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,000
but his mind is not taking it to be his.

148
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,400
He doesn't need to go to like a, I don't know, a retraining of his speech or behavior

149
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,600
and become refined and soft spoken and stuff, that's just management of external circumstances

150
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:12,120
which will never a problem in itself, which means that management is completely misguided.

151
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:20,600
So whatever, like, you know, if your habits are a course, whatever, if your habits are

152
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,360
a course, or whatever, it doesn't matter, what matters is you don't actually appropriate

153
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,520
the pictures a whole for a man that pictures him, he's a masculine, it's a man.

154
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:40,160
So he can, he can, he can stay masculine, as long as that masculinity doesn't belong

155
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,280
to him, that's all it takes, except for a woman, obviously they will limit the amount

156
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,280
of your interaction, so to speak, the amount of actions you will do an account of that

157
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,680
masculinity, like somebody who is entertaining that masculinity will obviously be revolving

158
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,840
on a woman who, who, who delights in her femininity, will obviously be putting that forward,

159
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,920
her feminine side, she'll be indulging it, taking it step further, developing it, refining

160
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,520
it, whatever else.

161
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,360
So that won't be done by the person who has abandoned either masculine and femininity

162
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,520
respectively, but it doesn't mean that they have to undo whatever has a reason on its

163
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,800
side, because you're a man, it's a fact, you're born in a male gender, you're born in female

164
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,680
gender, that's it, you don't need to deny it, you know, because whatever, you don't know

165
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,280
the escape from it, which is usually when people try to do it, how it's genderless, it's

166
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,240
beyond gender, it's not, gender is given, it's a fact, it's your world, your body is your

167
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,800
world, it determines it, determines the intentionality behind it, determines all the desire, but

168
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:57,320
you don't have to take it to belong to you, and that's what Aranji is, so a woman can

169
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,960
stay a woman, she'll stay a woman, and she can be an Aranth, obviously she won't be

170
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,880
doing anything else in reality, or anything else in a kind of appropriation of the body,

171
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,080
which she has completely free herself from, so her mind goes beyond it, but it doesn't

172
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,800
mean that you deny it, she still knows the fact that this is a female body, and same

173
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:37,440
for a man, because what about the, she could, when he could make the other, by entertaining

174
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,400
his masculinity, he knows what he's doing as well, he has a track team, yes, of course,

175
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,160
that's a female, of course, yeah, no it can be, it can be done intentionally, there's

176
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,240
no doubt about that, it's a seduction, no matter who does it to who, but then that would

177
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,600
be impossible if a man, like a man wouldn't be able to seduce a woman if he's not giving

178
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,040
notions and appropriating and delighting in his masculinity, and same, a woman who is

179
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:11,600
given up her femininity, wouldn't be out trying to seduce men, nor would she be out, or

180
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,400
even delighting in the notions of being liked by men, or being disliked by men, does

181
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,920
it even matter to her, and same, it even matters to a man, if every, like, like, like, when

182
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,320
they were on the ruler, they had a hand, he was apparently in the suit, as he was still

183
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,920
very handsome, so lots of women, just, you know, when they were not, when they were

184
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,200
doing this, and when they tried to seduce him, and you know, number of our rules evolved

185
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,080
around that, like, not to belong because the stories that had happened to him, I mean, he

186
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
was all avoiding it, I mean, he was in that round, but then the Buddha said, well, somebody

187
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,360
who's not in that round, he ends up in that position, they might quite likely give

188
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,040
in, so then all the rules, they evolved around, in secluded with a woman, and so on, to

189
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,040
be avoided, he was around the stories when he, you know, and they're quite a few times

190
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,000
he's not able to come up, because he was clearly still attractive to the, to fit, to

191
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,320
the woman, but he was in that round, so he wasn't entertaining it, nor was he all trying

192
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:17,160
to seduce it, he's just, obviously, the other minds, they were still in kind of trapped

193
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,000
by their own femininity, would find this form that comes in their range, a form of

194
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,720
Wanderblum, or attractive, yeah, and then she tried to seduce that innkeeper, the woman

195
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,720
yes, yeah, when she got rid of me, no, I'll don't say this crowded, I'll give you a secluded

196
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,440
innkeeper, yeah, and then she got into special, but then she, when he did not respond to

197
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,040
her advances, then she felt, oh, a bit ashamed, and then, well, actually impressed, because

198
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,160
she said, oh, she was also good looking, according to her own account, because she said,

199
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,960
many people tried to, you know, pay her wealth just to spend the night with her loads of,

200
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,080
but here, look, I'm offering myself to this, this, this, this reckless, and he's not

201
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,040
even looking at me, and then she dressed herself up, I apologize, and took a refuge in within

202
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:11,880
a month, because she was inspired by it, doesn't know what a boy done with it, so, because

203
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:19,440
there's this, let's suit, let's suit her about, a teleporter, the actor, yes, and yeah,

204
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,040
he asked the Buddha, where will I be reborn, as an actor, the Buddha says, don't ask me that,

205
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,240
he was the actor comedian, yeah, a comedian, yeah, you don't ask, so I think comedians,

206
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,760
you know, asked the Buddha three times, and the Buddha said, no, no, no, you don't know

207
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:42,520
this, and then he said, and the, he said, the other, other actors say that, because he's

208
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:49,280
an actor comedian, he will be reborn, yeah, in the, in the realm of the laughing devours,

209
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,600
and the Buddha said, I'm afraid not, you'll be born in the laughing hell, in the realm of

210
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,840
the laughing hell, and he's like crying, because he was actually happy, yeah, now he found

211
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,920
the right way that he shouldn't be, yeah, the Buddha thought he was crying, and he said,

212
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,480
see, I told you don't ask me, because I knew, like, you know, he said, he said, no, no,

213
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,080
no, no, I'm not crying, because I'm upset, I'm crying, because I'm not, I've been told

214
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,880
the truth, finally, and like, I've been lied all this time, that by being a comedian,

215
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm going to be reborn in this comedic heaven, but, but now I know the truth, and that's

216
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,800
when he went for, okay, and that's the Buddha said, you encourage others, agree, take

217
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,600
the illusion, yeah, like basically, the minds of others, they're not free from greed

218
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,160
aversion delusion, they come to watch you, and then you, with your mind, who's not free

219
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,600
from greed aversion delusion, perform actions, they make them laugh, and make the greed aversion

220
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,200
delusion increase, thus, like, basically, audience is full of greed aversion delusion,

221
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,880
actor is full of greed aversion delusion, and the old result of it is more, increasing

222
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,720
greed aversion delusion, like you're four or whatever, and that's just making things much

223
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:13,240
worse, that they actually are, because, because people's happiness revolves around sensuality,

224
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,960
more, more, you know, more adopted, so even comedy or whatever, just making happy, laughing

225
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,840
through, through, basically, through distraction, through, through carelessness and so on,

226
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,720
just bringing all the, all the assas, they're, they're already there to increase, all the

227
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:37,400
tense, all the tense, yeah, good, let's think with this, let in keep a woman, okay,

228
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:45,800
sure she went, she changed her ways, but encouraging, lasting others, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

229
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,000
yeah, that is your responsibility, exactly, yeah, in the, yeah, exactly, yeah, you're developing

230
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,760
your masculinity, in order to seduce it, to infect minds of others with more lust and

231
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,640
aversion delusion, oh yeah, yeah, in that, in that way, yeah, oh yeah, that is, that, you

232
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,440
know, because that is the content, that's intentional action, somebody setting on, seduce a woman,

233
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,280
a woman, seduce a man, and then that results in their mind, being infected by lust, a

234
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:23,200
version or delusion, that's all basically, well, there is a good deal of shared responsibility

235
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,600
in that, yeah, I mean, their response of being ignorant in the first place, sure, for being

236
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,720
in the main of lust, for keeping themselves in the main of lust, for giving into lust, because

237
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:40,880
you can always say no, but obviously, the seduce has his own take, take of that, that, if

238
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:48,360
you think of, like this actor, now you think, pornography, or pornography, well, that is

239
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,320
like the course, yeah, yeah, that's the course, because that is just purely, solely based

240
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:03,560
and aimed at, just lust, just fire of lust, yeah, so yeah, movies, music, no matter how meaningful

241
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,960
it might be, the first facility is entertaining, purposefully this is basically fiction, taking

242
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,600
my way, romance, romance, yeah, and also, you know, it's done selectively, you know,

243
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,760
either romantic movie, you basically, you show the romantic things, romantic build up drama

244
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,800
or whatever else, you don't actually show everything in a human life, because people

245
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,800
probably gross by it, getting up, you know, having diarrhea, and then going meeting your

246
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,200
loved one for coffee, and still having to run to a toilet, yeah, you show that in a movie,

247
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,480
it would not be a romantic movie, but you only show the point of it, and that's not what

248
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:52,280
life is, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

249
00:25:52,280 --> 00:26:03,960
I've heard it before, you've heard it as well, that to overcome these sexual desire, everyone

250
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:14,960
should tease the defilements, tease the defilements, go near, you know, go visit woman, go, that is

251
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,760
beyond stupid, that I would not even talk about it, give me something warm in, yeah, good,

252
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:34,040
good, because I think some people think, to entertain those sexual energies is, you become

253
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:42,080
stronger, basically, like, for example, the whole tantric practice in verticals, basically,

254
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,720
people try to overcome it, one way or the other, and they can't, they have absolutely no

255
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,320
idea how to, and then what did you, well, then they make a practice out of it, why, because

256
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,880
then they will feel like no, no, this is the way, they will feel like they're overcoming

257
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,000
it, overcoming the coarseness of sensuality, while still remaining very much engaging it,

258
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,160
so they just end up the whole purpose of the whole thing, it's just to lie to yourself,

259
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:16,440
to mask responsibility, to mask the failure, you're not able to send out your desire, you're

260
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,880
not able to overcome the sensual domain, and say, no, it's not about overcoming, it's

261
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,080
about whatever, engaging with it, teasing it, adding to it, you must not deny that energy,

262
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,160
you know, only a person who cannot overcome it will say that, because otherwise, you'd

263
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,800
have to admit to this of their weak, and they're not worthy, obviously, worthy of the goal

264
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:44,720
that they themselves set forward, without declaring their weakness, exactly, without declaring

265
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,920
it, and it would be actually much better if they would be authentic enough, transparent

266
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,560
enough, to admit that their weak, no matter how bad it feels, why, because that bad feeling

267
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,280
will, it might actually make them make proper effort further down the line, if they give

268
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,920
in and cover it up and say, no, no, no, it's not about, this is not weakness, this is

269
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,960
the strength, what, no, it's not, strength is giving up, you're not giving up, well,

270
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,160
you're not supposed to give up, you're supposed to entertain it, well, that's only a weak

271
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,000
person who would say that, a person who doesn't know how to give it up, and the only choice

272
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,240
for him is to entertain it, so what he ends up doing is basically just say more before,

273
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,520
entertain the sensuality, just kind of developing a different excuse for it, or a more elaborate,

274
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,520
or a more meaningful background, like on a spiritual practice, otherwise, because he's just

275
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,960
going to be very, very cold, you say the sense of shame disappears there, well it would,

276
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,120
yeah, yeah, you got, become stronger than me, you cover it up, you cover the sense of shame,

277
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,520
when you decide to cover the feeling of guilt for not being able to say no, and your sense

278
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,320
of shame goes with it, when you cover it, you cover it, that's right, yeah, well that's

279
00:28:52,320 --> 00:29:00,160
taking to be a problem, yeah, sure, sure, yeah, we need not embarrass anymore, oh yeah,

280
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,720
there is that practice, yeah, yeah, when you don't feel such a shame, doing shameful things,

281
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:13,000
yeah, but you know, all this, all this sense of shame basically, it's no natural, it's

282
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,880
the product of society, and you really going to be empowered if you ignore it, that it's

283
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,040
shameful, and then just go ahead and do it, nobody's starting hard to live your life,

284
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,560
so, and that is what, what, you know, modest society kind of encourages one way or the other,

285
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,200
because again, the sense of shame bothers you, feeling of guilt bothers you, and then you

286
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,640
blame others for it, you don't recognize it, there is a natural aspect to

287
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:42,200
sense of shame, and feeling of guilt, sure, if the whole society is repressed, yeah, it's

288
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,960
delusional, repressed, whatever else, but that doesn't mean you should deny the entire

289
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,640
sense of shame on a personal level, because it is quite natural, and it would have said

290
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,960
these are the natural protectors of the world, without the natural sense of shame, well,

291
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,160
men would be like dogs, brothers would sleep with sisters, sisters with fathers, mothers

292
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:12,240
with sons, just, just, they would be complete, complete disarray, but it bothers people,

293
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,080
they don't know how to deal with it, they don't have any wisdom in regard to it, to recognize

294
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:23,760
it, yeah, there is an overflow of like, shaming and guilt by the society, certain societies

295
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,520
in some, I don't know, repressed countries or whatever else, but that doesn't mean that

296
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,360
is the entire thing, there is the personal aspect of that sense of shame, because yeah, it's

297
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,360
a shameful thing, it's a private thing, so, and people can't draw their line, they can

298
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,160
sit there, so, when they rebel against it, they rebel against the whole thing, and they

299
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:50,800
become utterly shameless, utterly shameless, oh, and you feel liberated, that's it, that's

300
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,640
another world we've all liberated, because suddenly you feel free, it's basically like

301
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,240
a liberation of, of just giving, opening the floodgains of the desire even more, or there's

302
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,520
now, there's nothing stopping you, before you actually had that sense of shame, then

303
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,120
you mistook it to be something that it isn't, you denied it, you made the effort to cover

304
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,760
it, to destroy it, to ignore it, to rebel against it, and you feel liberated, it's a liberation

305
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:22,520
of just outpour, which means, sure, it feels a relief when you open the gates, but you

306
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,080
wouldn't feel a relief if you were to know what these floods are taking you, if they're

307
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,320
taking you down the messy waterfall, you're gonna crash at the bottom, you will not feel

308
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,880
a relief if somebody opens the gate, you will feel life threatening, and on the contrary,

309
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,680
you would feel relieved if the gates stay closed, so you don't flow down the waterfall

310
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,000
where you're gonna crash into death, but not knowing that, yeah, oh yeah, it's a joyous

311
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,480
ride, until, oh, it's too late now, to swim back, because that's one approach, trying

312
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:03,280
to escape such things, sensuality, he's, take tantric, he's tantric, Buddhism, tantric,

313
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,360
you know, find some contradiction in terms, take it in terms of contradictions, and meditation,

314
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:19,280
sensual celibacy, tantric Buddhism, Buddha, he goes on to carry, eat, carry a celibacy

315
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,520
from a chariot, and there's a sutra on that, where he describes what that is, and someone

316
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,080
would say this is the other extreme, like, completes the suppression, all these things

317
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,800
aren't, you know, it's just not the strict, it is, absolutely, you're beating yourself

318
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,320
out, you're not supposed to press the desires, because you see them, pointless, meaningless,

319
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,360
insatiable, and only resulting in harm, in a long run, so yeah, by all means, suppress

320
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,320
it, because through that suppression, wisdom might arise, one thing for sure, wisdom

321
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,160
will not arise from giving it, so wisdom will not necessarily arise through somebody

322
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,720
who is practicing full-on restraint, so wisdom will not necessarily arise just on that,

323
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,200
but it can, and one thing for sure, it cannot arise if there is no basis of restraint,

324
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,240
that's another sutra that we said, even if somebody spends the whole life without kind

325
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,640
of developing any wisdom, just through sheer restraint and saying no to desires, and even

326
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,160
if they go through extreme pains because of that, and spend the whole life in tears for

327
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,840
the rest of their life, it's still much better than giving in, like just once, because

328
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,240
in a long run, again, you spend years, forcefully, for somebody who is no wisdom, keeping

329
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,320
the mind away from giving into centrality, and that's making lots of merit, because

330
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,560
you know, people think merit for the future life is just through giving, no, that was

331
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,960
the lowest aspect, because they said yeah, through giving to one person, to the Buddha,

332
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,960
to the Buddha, to the other hand, to the Sangha, give more, but none of that would equal

333
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,600
the amount of merit, the streams of merit, you would make it like if you develop a finger

334
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,200
snap of a right view, a finger snap of freedom from centrality, a finger snap of non-cruelty,

335
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,000
finger snap of loving kind, a finger snap, so somebody for a whole lifetime, that's

336
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,080
what meant when I said in the beginning, it's actually, even if somebody doesn't want

337
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,960
to, in the Arab or whatever, it would be much better if they would practice celibacy,

338
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,080
they would say no to sexual desire, the mind would already grow by itself, just through

339
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,280
that, let alone if they make extra effort to gain wisdom, and they are, yeah, even if

340
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,560
it's painful for the rest of your life, so what, this is what means in the 50, 60 years,

341
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,440
how many years have you been reborn, how many years you will be reborn on account of

342
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,280
that, 50 years of crying your eyes out because of the pain and restring, nothing, they will

343
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:56,080
up in smoke, no time, yeah, the pain of restraint to the feeble of centrality, yeah, yeah, that's

344
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,680
like, you know, the most of the matter you can imagine, just practicing centrality strength,

345
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,680
non-cruelty towards people, non-identity, you say no to desires for the rest of your life,

346
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,080
what about, yeah, eons of heavenly rebirth, because those are the mental states, they will

347
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:22,840
take you there, but maybe I'm, if I have children, giving them opportunity to, to hear the

348
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:29,320
dumb, no, I don't follow that, what, people have children, they want to give, I've heard

349
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:35,520
it before, that you want to give other beings, no, sorry, so they have children, in order

350
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,240
for those children to later have opportunity to hear the dumb, yeah, well that sounds, sounds

351
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:52,320
like a terrible excuse, how about, because there is no guarantee you're going to become

352
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,000
an arrogant, even if you hear the dumb, so hearing the dumb in itself can be quite meaningless,

353
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,840
if a person doesn't know how to attend to it or doesn't want to, thus you can say to those

354
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,880
people who want to have children, you know, the children to hear the dumb maybe, it would

355
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:14,320
be better if they become arrogant themselves, so instead of optional remote possibility

356
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,040
of somebody becoming an arrogant by hearing the dumb in the future, they can become arrogant

357
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:26,760
themselves, and I mean one less than samsara, and that's the most you can do, but obviously

358
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:41,760
there is a much harder to do that than to produce a child.

359
00:36:41,760 --> 00:37:08,960
So go and read the sutra on celibacy.

360
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,960
So then a Brahman, Janasuni, approached the blessed one and exchanged, weeding with him,

361
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:23,040
and said to him, does Master Gautama also claim to be one who lives the celibid life?

362
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,000
In the Buddha replies, if Brahman one could rightly say of anyone, he lives the complete

363
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,640
and pure celibid life, unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unstained, it is precisely of

364
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,480
me that one might say this, for I live the complete and pure celibid life, unbroken,

365
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,480
flawless, unblemished, unstained.

366
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,560
But what Master Gautama is a breached flaw, a blemish and a stain of the celibid life?

367
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:59,320
He's here, Brahman, some ascetic, or Brahman, claiming to be perfectly celibid, does

368
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:05,040
not actually engage in intercourse, sexual intercourse with women, but he consents to being rubbed,

369
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,280
massaged, bathed by them.

370
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,960
He relishes this, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it.

371
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,000
This is a breached, a flaw, a blemish and a stain of the celibid life.

372
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,200
He's called one who lives an impure celibid life, one who is feted by the bond of sexuality.

373
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,560
He's not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief

374
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:36,240
and despair, he's not freed from suffering, I say.

375
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,400
Again some ascetic or Brahman claiming to be perfectly celibid, does not actually engage

376
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,440
in intercourse with women, does not, nor does he consent to being rubbed, massaged, but

377
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,480
he jokes with women, plays with them, and amuses himself with them.

378
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,320
Or he does not joke with women, play with them, and amuses himself with them, but he gazes

379
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,440
and stays straight into their eyes, or he does not gaze and stays straight into the woman's

380
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,720
eyes, but he listens to their voices behind a wall, or through a rampart as they laugh,

381
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,160
talk, sing a weep, or he does not listen to their voices, voices of women behind a

382
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:18,960
wall, but he recollects laughing, talking and playing with them in the past, or he does

383
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,280
not recollect laughing, talking and playing with them in the past, but he looks at a household

384
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,080
order, enjoying himself furnished and endowed with five objects of central pleasure.

385
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:36,280
Or he does not look at a householder, enjoying himself furnished and endowed with five objects

386
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,880
of central pleasure, but he lives the spiritual life, aspiring for rebirth in a certain

387
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:50,360
order of David's thinking, by this virtuous behaviour, observance and austerity, or spiritual

388
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,720
life, I will be a David, or one in the retinue of the David's, he relishes this desire and

389
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,560
desires it and finds satisfaction in it.

390
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,760
This too is a breach, a flaw, a blemish, and a stain of the celibate life.

391
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:11,200
Of the perfect celibate life, that is because now people might think of him and I must

392
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,040
not do anything, but it's actually better to at least be virtuous even if you are desiring

393
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,600
for the sake of rebirth than to be engaging in sexuality, because as that sort of a venerable

394
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,600
nanda was struggling and wanted to disrobe, and the Buddha said, why do you want to disrobe?

395
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,400
He said, well, there was this servant girl, there was quite pretty and she told me when

396
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,960
I come back, she will be waiting for me.

397
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:40,160
And then he showed him the beauty of the Davas, there was 500 names, whatever it was in

398
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,120
the service, and then he said, which is prettier, the names, or that servant girl, and he said,

399
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:51,240
well, the names, the servant girl is like a culturalized monkey, with ears bent off,

400
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,640
there's nothing comparison, he said, okay, well I can guarantee you, you're going to

401
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,760
have those names, they were names, if you practice the legacy for the rest of your life,

402
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,520
there will be your rebirth, and then he was like, okay, well, I'll do that, then you

403
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,800
go on motivation, however, sometime later the monks heard that, and then they were basically

404
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,320
looking out upon him and he felt ashamed, and then he actually made the effort properly

405
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,720
and became an adult, but yeah, it is better, even if you're desiring heaven, it is better

406
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:29,200
than committing the kind of animal-like sexuality in this world, it's not perfect, and the

407
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,200
sutra deals with perfect celebrities, so it's not perfect, so nobody says, oh, it's fine,

408
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,440
but you do need, like a person needs to distinguish, it's not on the same footing as having

409
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,080
sexual integrals, or allowing women to rub you, or you're rubbing them, or listening to

410
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,880
them, or talking to them, or depending on their company, all of this, they fantasizing

411
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:58,640
about that, if you can't give it all up, when at least do it like the last way, think

412
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,280
about heaven and practice rebirth for that, practice restraint for that sake of better rebirth,

413
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:11,520
it's still better, not ultimate, but better, because it sounds like repression, if you

414
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,040
really, you know, it is, it is repression, but it's just people, it's repression, yeah,

415
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:22,680
it is, so what, you are in a position to repress, in the same sense, like giving in, well,

416
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,320
it's, it's, it's, it's, what's the opposite of repression, well, giving in, I don't

417
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:35,680
do this, I guess it does, yeah, oh, this is just repressing, yes, you're, you're fighting

418
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,480
against some sort, the Buddha said you're going against the grain, yeah, that's exactly

419
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,920
what repression is, there's nothing wrong with it, sure, if you go mad and lose it while

420
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,360
you're too weak, the grain you were trying to resist it, then you just swept you, tough

421
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,000
luck, so you make yourself stronger, but one thing for sure, you never become stronger

422
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,920
if you practice no repression, no restraint, yeah, if you're strained, such, and fear of repression

423
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,680
is really just fear of going against centrality, fear of saying no to yourself, no to your

424
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:15,680
own mind, because if you say no, it might rebel and basically drive you mad, which kind

425
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,160
of reveals contradiction, which means that mind is not yours, yet you regard it very much

426
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,120
as yours, yet you're afraid to say no to it, but being mind means you're in full control

427
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,160
of it, supposedly, but if you can't say no to yourself, means you're not in full control

428
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,120
of it, thus that's not your mind, thus you should really be afraid when you're giving

429
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:39,760
into it, yeah, it's a scary man knocking on your door, and you're afraid to leave the

430
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,400
door closed, because he might break it in, but so you open the door, and then you let

431
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,800
him in, and that's even worse, it's absolutely no resistance there, because who knows, he

432
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,800
might not be able to break the door if you don't turn it a bit strong, if you learn how

433
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,800
to fortify before he breaks it, one thing for sure, if you let him in, then you're in his

434
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,600
mercy, or maybe he'll take me to put it the good way, maybe he'll take, maybe he won't

435
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,880
harm me, maybe, maybe, similarly, he will harm you, and that's what we said, was it the

436
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,880
assassins, the sixth, the sixth is like the assassin, the mind, the dearest, like a dearest

437
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,040
friend that you trust with your life, and then he kills you in your sleep, that's like

438
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,680
the nature of a pleasant relationship with that mind, you never question a mind, your

439
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,920
own mind as your own enemy, you don't see it as a dangerous assassin, it's just trying

440
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:57,800
to get your sort of your friendship, your trust, and then kill you, at the end of that

441
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:08,280
day, the Buddha still says, but when I did not see even one of these seven bonds of sexuality

442
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,680
that had not been abandoned, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfecting

443
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,840
enlightenment in this world, the knowledge and vision arose in me, unshakable is my

444
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:24,960
liberation of mind, this is my last birth, now there is no more renewed existence, when

445
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:38,880
you saw that it was perfectly sober, the mind was completely drawn from it, but again,

446
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:48,960
those trying to perfect those points, you know, not even looking in a woman's eyes, there's

447
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,400
that time that the Buddha says, if you do, if you have to look, you have to look, again,

448
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,640
all of that, I mean, you know, the Buddha was talking with women and queens and whatever

449
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,880
else would come to me, so you have to understand that this is all these acts are not to be done

450
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,480
if they are rooted in sexuality, so again, don't just deny everything and cover your

451
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,360
eyes and run away if there is just a woman on the other side of the road, that's just

452
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,680
neurotic really, I mean, in the beginning, you should do it if you can't differentiate,

453
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:24,800
but don't hold that to be the perfect behavior, because one way or the other, you're running

454
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,280
away from it, which means it's bothering you, which means you're not free from it.

455
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,320
So all of this refers to when you're doing it for the sake of basically a sexual desire,

456
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,000
then it doesn't go to the point of sexual intercourse, but then you're like, oh, in touch

457
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,360
for the sexual desire, and maybe you don't let them touch you, but then you could talk

458
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:49,440
to them, you'd shout them up just for the enjoyment of sexual desire, then you might be talking

459
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,080
to them, then you're listening to them, looking at them, listening to them, fantasizing

460
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:59,560
about them, but if that's not rooted anymore, you obviously wouldn't be fantasizing about

461
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,680
them, and if you were to talk to them for whatever reason, it wouldn't be rooted in that

462
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:14,680
like, a sexuality in the design for sex, you just thought it wouldn't be rooted in that.

463
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,160
It might seem a bit rude to people as well.

464
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,520
Well, yeah, and sometimes it might be, and that's, again, you recognize, okay, so I'm

465
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:30,280
not supposed to, you know, be neurotic about it, but it's better to start a bit neurotic,

466
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:38,480
that's even not, then to start a bit loose, so if, during your neurotic phase, you might

467
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,760
be rude, it's okay, take, take, you know, on the responsibility for it, but, but recognize

468
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,560
it, okay, well, it's just a side, it's a fact of, of the current behaviour I'm engaging

469
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,120
in, which is like extra slightly neurotic restraint, so it's rude, but it's okay, I can live

470
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:02,040
with it, better to be rude, with a prospect of enlightenment, then polite, and ignorant.

471
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:07,960
I'm not just saying rude behaviour, by the way, but I'm just saying, if you recognize,

472
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,960
yeah, some people just rude, because they care less, but this is different.

473
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:24,800
Yeah, not to encourage it as well, and others, because you can also, it might be coming from

474
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:32,400
you, but you see the mind of the other is infected, by the loss, yeah, that was the point of

475
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,680
the, of all those, like, I'm rude, it was an art, he wouldn't have, he couldn't have

476
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,360
engaged in any sexual activity with that woman, but would have said, but if any other who

477
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,720
was not an art and was in that circumstances, he most definitely would have, so that's

478
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:52,640
why you prevent the circumstance, however, again, you must not neglect, and you must

479
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,200
not ignore the fact that it's all for the purpose of developing wisdom, because there is

480
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:05,200
no end then, to try to, to try to kind of say no to circumstances, and then you just

481
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,280
become ridiculous, and then people justify it all because it's the restraint, not necessarily.

482
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,520
If you're doing it out of, as we spoke before, you know, there is the obviously strength,

483
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,760
but then if you're just going out of this, this is like insane, ridiculous random measures,

484
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,280
like what giants used to do, and you just clearly, just you can see how it evolved,

485
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,240
irrationally, where they would go to arms, arms, and then obviously get the food, but then

486
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,760
you just felt too indulgent, then you take food only out of that, and after every third

487
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,600
house, then you don't take food on the, on the person on the right side of the crossroads,

488
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,800
then you don't take food from a woman, then you don't, no, you don't take food from a

489
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,040
woman, then you don't take food from a woman, then you don't take food, then you take

490
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,720
food every, then you don't take food at all, this is just ridiculous, and yet that's

491
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,640
often the attitude people might have, they might not take it in that regard, but when

492
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,520
it comes to like saying no, and just fear, and then just no to this, no to this, no

493
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:09,680
reason, then it becomes ridiculous, but it's, it's saying easy, it's completely irrational,

494
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:18,480
and by giving in, by encouraging that irrational behavior, you forget that your, the response,

495
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,440
well, your responsibility is to develop wisdom on the basis of restraint that you are practicing,

496
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,440
so you forget about that dimension, and all you end up doing is investing more effort

497
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:35,640
in just restraining your restraint, there is no need to push it further, leave it, because

498
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,240
you are restrained, leave it, and now do the work, now just exactly, now do the work, now

499
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:47,640
just go back and keep tightening already things that are already tight enough, because

500
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:58,920
that restraint obviously was not, not fantasizing about sexual behavior, is a world reveal that

501
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:06,240
craving to go in that direction, that's the need for that pleasure, it will just be revealed

502
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,600
if you're looking for it, it will show you straight away, but if all you're looking for

503
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:16,560
is the next step for your restraint after this completely restrained, every aspect yet

504
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,760
you then just keep okay, restraint further, and further, you'll never stop and look back

505
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:36,360
and see what the real problem is, the craving, the desire, the ignorance, you're which

506
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:45,200
was always the problem, and just to read that suitably, he spoke about in the beginning,

507
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:52,720
called a union and disengagement, because I will teach you a Dharma exposition on union

508
00:51:52,720 --> 00:52:00,640
and disengagement, listen, and what is a Dharma exposition on union and disengagement?

509
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:06,840
A woman attends internally to her feminine faculty, her feminine comportment, her feminine

510
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:14,120
appearance, her feminine aspect, her feminine desire, her feminine voice, her feminine ornaments,

511
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:20,160
she becomes exited by these and takes delight in them, excited by them, taking delight in

512
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,920
them, she attends externally to a man's masculine faculty, his masculine comportment, his

513
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,600
masculine appearance, his masculine aspect, his masculine desire, his masculine forays, his

514
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:37,360
masculine ornaments, she becomes excited by these and takes delight in them, excited by

515
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:43,480
them, take delight in them, she desires union externally, and she also desires the pleasure

516
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,360
pleasure and joy that arise on account of such union.

517
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,920
Beings who are delighted with their femininity enter upon union with men.

518
00:52:52,920 --> 00:53:01,040
It is in this way that a woman does not transcend her femininity and likewise with a man.

519
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,800
And the opposite where she doesn't attend to her femininity, then there's disengagement.

520
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,800
Exactly.

521
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:16,200
It's not entertaining the basis for all those things, because I delight in the femininity.

522
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:25,640
So instead of blaming men or men blaming women, just uproot the delight in your own manliness

523
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:34,920
or in your own femininity, uproot it, you have to deny it.

524
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:44,000
There was that sort of a monk couldn't free himself from, oh no, I think that was in the rules.

525
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,120
I know, I think it was the suit actually.

526
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:55,400
When he couldn't free himself from central desire, so he kind of started going mad and he cut his sexual organ off.

527
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,720
And he said foolish, instead of cutting one thing, he cut a wrong thing.

528
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,640
Cutting the ignorance.

529
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:15,040
Yeah, because that's not your masculine, ignorance in regard to the masculine form, is masculine.

530
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:29,360
So you can have all the masculine form you want, if you're not ignorant in regard to it, if you're not delighting it, if you see it as impermanent, if you see it as not personal, not dear to it, not yours, not internally held, same for a woman.

531
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:46,480
Because you're whatever you've born, you'll always be that. Exactly. And it wasn't yours to begin with, actually.

532
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:54,160
Because if you were to truly own that form, you wouldn't age, you wouldn't get sick, you wouldn't die.

533
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:01,960
He has its own cause, basically. You're just interfering with it.

534
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:31,760
And their cause is the cause of impermanent.
