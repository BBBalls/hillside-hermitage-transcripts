00:00.000 --> 00:25.360
what is the escape from pain most people think it's hot most people think it is

00:25.360 --> 00:31.000
pleasure pleasure the escape from pain well they don't necessarily think that

00:31.000 --> 00:39.840
I think that's the only escape that I know so the only attitude that a person

00:39.840 --> 00:46.600
without a right view will have only one attitude towards pain which is

00:46.600 --> 00:51.840
covered in pleasure that's the only means of escape that I know either to

00:51.840 --> 00:56.280
try to get rid of the pain because that's more pleasant or to actually finding

00:56.280 --> 01:00.400
some different pleasure to occupy yourself with so you forget about the

01:00.400 --> 01:05.120
pain either way you turn towards pleasure in order to avoid pain because you can't

01:05.120 --> 01:10.160
deal with pain on its own terms so and that that's what the what the sort to

01:10.160 --> 01:15.000
say they put to dinner doesn't know any other escape from pain other than

01:15.000 --> 01:21.480
sensuality essential pleasure that's what I've seen before like the the people

01:21.480 --> 01:25.480
another tractor to sensuality just because it's pleasant and gives you that you

01:25.480 --> 01:30.520
know sweet taste or something they're also dependent on it because that the

01:30.520 --> 01:38.040
only means that their mind has dealing with pain so the prospect of sensuality

01:38.040 --> 01:43.800
it's already something people depend on the possibility of getting placed exactly

01:43.800 --> 01:51.000
at least at least pleasure is is perpetually possible I might be refraining from it

01:51.000 --> 01:56.200
not engaging with sensuality but I'm still using the possibility of pleasure as a

01:56.200 --> 02:00.960
relief from when the pain is there so you still depend on the pleasure I can

02:00.960 --> 02:05.280
deal with this pain now because there is a possibility there is a there is a

02:05.280 --> 02:08.760
promise a prospect of pleasure later on they will be great and so it's worth

02:08.760 --> 02:13.680
enduring this pain now and that's fine everybody like even when you want

02:13.680 --> 02:17.600
hard-hunching to be free from suffering you still have the projected idea of

02:17.600 --> 02:23.480
pleasure through it but the the whole practice revolves around actually not

02:23.480 --> 02:31.040
removing your dependence on sensual pleasure as a mean of dealing with pain

02:31.040 --> 02:35.640
so removing your dependence even on the possibility of sensual pleasure as means

02:35.640 --> 02:41.920
of dealing with pain that's why when people had heard the Buddha described

02:41.920 --> 02:48.160
Nibbana to them the pathogenes in the suttas they were well they were scared

02:48.160 --> 02:53.360
because in their minds it was like oh that's basically complete absence of joy

02:53.360 --> 02:57.120
pleasure the only form of joy and pleasure they're the nanolite of my

02:57.120 --> 03:00.680
nose which is central pleasure so in their minds all this was like this is the

03:00.680 --> 03:04.120
most depressing miserable dreadful thing they will kill me and destroy me if

03:04.120 --> 03:10.240
that's they were they were generally generally shocked afraid by it

03:10.240 --> 03:19.120
good anxiety of fear because mind that depends on pleasure absence of pleasure

03:19.120 --> 03:25.960
means misery but it doesn't absence of pleasure does not mean pain just means

03:25.960 --> 03:31.720
absence of pleasure absence of pain as well so basically what those people were

03:31.720 --> 03:38.760
afraid of was just a pure neutral feeling neither pleasant nor unpleasant but the

03:38.760 --> 03:45.200
mind that depends on pleasure neither pleasant means painful doesn't matter

03:45.200 --> 03:51.240
that it's not unpleasant either the fact that it's not pleasant for the mind

03:51.240 --> 03:56.280
that depends on pleasure is terrifying but it's terrifying not because in

03:56.280 --> 03:59.600
itself it's terrifying it's terrifying because you're refusing to give up your

03:59.600 --> 04:05.200
dependence on pleasure not of fear but that fear feeds your dependence which

04:05.200 --> 04:08.480
then makes you afraid which and feeds the defense it's a vicious circle

04:08.480 --> 04:17.600
centrality or pardana or centrality so this neutral feeling because of your

04:17.600 --> 04:22.880
craving for pleasure it's it's just exactly and that's what the suttas say

04:22.880 --> 04:26.320
when neutral feeling is not known not understood not discerned it will be

04:26.320 --> 04:32.040
felt unpleasantly so that's what meant like you you you nibana is the absence

04:32.040 --> 04:38.880
of joy it's joyless but joylessness does not mean misery

04:38.880 --> 04:44.880
joylessness means equanimity joylessness means no joy and no pain means peace

04:44.880 --> 04:50.440
means evenness but in order to value that the mind needs to train to that

04:50.440 --> 04:55.960
level needs to train for it so in other words you need to discern and

04:55.960 --> 05:00.120
develop wisdom in regard to the neutral feeling and then it will become the

05:00.120 --> 05:06.360
supreme peace of nibana nothing can match that peace but in mind it depends on

05:06.360 --> 05:11.640
pleasure depends on prospect and uses at least the possibility of future

05:11.640 --> 05:17.640
pleasure as a means of relief in regard to the day-to-day pain when that mind

05:17.640 --> 05:23.440
here joylessness that is automatically felt as misery absolute depressing

05:23.440 --> 05:28.800
overwhelming pain it's not pleasant but it's not unpleasant either but you

05:28.800 --> 05:32.160
don't get to value the fact that it's not unpleasant either because you're too

05:32.160 --> 05:37.660
concerned about oh there is no joy so that's the sensory strength needs to be

05:37.660 --> 05:42.000
done before if you have true sensory strength you basically start training

05:42.000 --> 05:47.600
yourself towards joylessness of sensuality and then again the root of

05:47.600 --> 05:52.720
sensuality as the Buddha said so many times is your delight in the joy that

05:52.720 --> 05:58.080
you get on account it's not the beautiful or tasty objects in the world the root

05:58.080 --> 06:03.680
of sensuality is your dependence on that type of pleasure nothing else remove

06:03.680 --> 06:09.240
that dependence on that pleasure and you will find peace so sensory strain is

06:09.240 --> 06:14.480
physically preparing you withdrawing you from that pleasure so then mentally you

06:14.480 --> 06:19.440
can see how gratuitously you depend on it and then choose to withdraw yourself

06:19.440 --> 06:24.540
because oh this is not worth clinging to as the suttas would say but if you're not

06:24.540 --> 06:30.320
physically withdrawn you will never mentally be able to like stop depending

06:30.320 --> 06:38.280
on it so sensory strength means basically emulating nibana pretty much

06:38.280 --> 06:42.960
emulating the non-dependence on on joy that's that's acquired through

06:42.960 --> 06:48.640
senses but you need to start doing it even if you still want to do have it

06:48.640 --> 06:53.120
mentally physically at least you need to be drawn verbally you need to be withdrawn

06:53.120 --> 06:57.640
and then eventually mentally you'll be able to do so as well but yeah once you

06:57.640 --> 07:03.440
start withdrawing yourself on that engaging in pleasures then what will

07:03.440 --> 07:07.680
naturally occur is that experience of mutual freedom well exactly once you

07:07.680 --> 07:12.040
start withdrawing yourself physically from pleasures that's already training

07:12.040 --> 07:16.960
for you to be able to endure the neutral feeling and not freak out in

07:16.960 --> 07:22.120
regard to it so only people that are not withdrawn bodily verbally mentally from

07:22.120 --> 07:26.360
sensuality lose their mind when they recognize what nibana is or that will

07:26.360 --> 07:30.520
kill me that will destroy me if you already have been cultivating sensory

07:30.520 --> 07:36.880
strength say not yourself taming your senses practicing sense control it's not

07:36.880 --> 07:42.640
gonna be as frightening the joylessness of nibana will be something you can

07:42.640 --> 07:46.600
actually get closer to as opposed to lose your mind fall on the ground pull

07:46.600 --> 07:51.440
your hair be the breasts in despair like oh that will kill me as they did when

07:51.440 --> 07:57.240
the Buddha would clearly show what nibana what he's teaching is now that's

07:57.240 --> 08:03.160
what's always said like like those who are free from passion they have no like

08:03.160 --> 08:07.080
fear even in face of death because that's what that is cessation of these

08:07.080 --> 08:14.560
senses upon which what upon which pleasures I depend but those who are

08:14.560 --> 08:18.800
free from passion even when these senses are threatened there is no fear

08:18.800 --> 08:22.480
because there's no passion I there's no dependence on the pleasure of the

08:22.480 --> 08:29.620
senses so the absence of passion means no fear of death means no fear of

08:29.620 --> 08:34.480
nibana means no fear of dispassion doesn't mean speech depression doesn't

08:34.480 --> 08:38.320
mean exactly depression it's only generated from the point of view you

08:38.320 --> 08:43.440
still depends on the pleasure and now you found something that fully like a

08:43.440 --> 08:47.280
crashes that dependence removes it and there is no more future of it and that

08:47.280 --> 08:51.080
is scary because you refuse to give it up or because neutral feeling in itself

08:51.080 --> 08:58.600
is scary so it's joyless but it's also there is but that though that doesn't

08:58.600 --> 09:06.160
mean it's miserable so absence of joy and absence of misery that's the absence of

09:06.160 --> 09:11.520
ambitious and like a thirsty inspiration for achievement and absence of depression

09:11.520 --> 09:15.360
as the other hand in the suit that would say in the terra terra terra terra

09:15.360 --> 09:20.400
gata I delight not in life is actually no delight towards anything in this life

09:20.400 --> 09:28.880
through the senses and I delight not in death right I await my time and that's

09:28.880 --> 09:34.920
the other hand declaration there's no delight and a description of the

09:34.920 --> 09:41.080
fourth John and that's the perfect complete surmounting your equanimity you

09:41.080 --> 09:47.680
know oopak a sati is but it's just a mounting of that pleasure and pain and

09:47.680 --> 09:54.160
joy and grief and the spirit of that pleasure and pain so it's it's

09:54.160 --> 10:00.720
completely steadied mind in a neutral feeling and that's the whole point and

10:00.720 --> 10:04.920
that's what the jana is even the first jana it's it's already from the point of

10:04.920 --> 10:09.240
view of non-jana first jana it's like steadying your mind in the neutral feeling

10:09.240 --> 10:13.960
neutral from that point of view obviously you can go even further and and

10:13.960 --> 10:18.280
refine that neutral feeling up to the point of full jana equanimity but even

10:18.280 --> 10:22.360
the first jana starts by abandoning joy and grief in regard to the world and

10:22.360 --> 10:26.320
unification of the mind that comes on a kind of thinking and pondering and so on

10:26.320 --> 10:31.640
and that in itself it's felt pleasantly in a sense of a neutral peace neutral

10:31.640 --> 10:35.040
feeling when understood it's felt pleasantly that's what the truth is

10:35.040 --> 10:40.880
saying neutral feeling when not understood it is felt unpleasantly to

10:40.880 --> 10:45.280
the understanding your knowledge your discernment of it determines how you're

10:45.280 --> 10:51.600
gonna feel it so joylessness when understood it's pleasant because there's

10:51.600 --> 10:56.800
no disturbance joylessness when not understood it's miserable dreadful

10:56.800 --> 11:02.440
anxious overwhelming so how do you prepare yourself to endure it that which

11:02.440 --> 11:07.120
is overwhelmingly anxious and so on by starting the sensory strength by seeing

11:07.120 --> 11:12.000
the danger in the slightest fault by being watchful mindful careful you're

11:12.000 --> 11:16.200
already practicing strength to be able to endure the neutral feeling which is

11:16.200 --> 11:20.320
initially gonna try to scare you and then you train yourself to that and this

11:20.320 --> 11:25.000
passion is being developed again it comes back to also the other pride

11:25.000 --> 11:29.320
talk with it or non-activity non-engagement fear of boredom that people

11:29.320 --> 11:32.760
have fear of nothing to do so whether they practice Buddhism or not maybe

11:32.760 --> 11:36.400
everything just becomes another thing I do to keep myself occupied because

11:36.400 --> 11:40.960
otherwise I get overwhelmed by the neutrality I mean boredom is truly just

11:40.960 --> 11:46.520
neutral yet it's the more dreadful thing for every mind that's not developed

11:46.520 --> 11:52.800
so there's more understanding you again the more pleasure will become that

11:52.800 --> 11:56.720
neutral feeling that absence of joy

11:58.640 --> 12:03.400
it's not that you know Aravan's feelings is some like mystical dimension

12:03.400 --> 12:05.720
no it's just three types of feelings whether you're protrusion or an

12:05.720 --> 12:11.120
Aravan is just how much influence those three types of feeling have over you and

12:11.120 --> 12:14.800
your decisions and your views and your assumptions or whether you are free

12:14.800 --> 12:18.000
from views and assumptions in regards to these feelings and then in the felt

12:18.000 --> 12:24.640
there's just the felt and the same is just the scene her just the same principle

12:24.640 --> 12:30.400
so the feeling that's felt your neutral in regard to it

12:32.040 --> 12:35.480
there's no pressure so there's no pressure means truly there's really no

12:35.480 --> 12:40.640
feeling there in that sense theogenous feeling are gone in an Aravan but it

12:40.640 --> 12:47.480
doesn't mean that Aravan has no aggregate of feeling and so how can Aravan feel

12:47.480 --> 12:51.640
without feeling seeming contradiction well develop understanding of a neutral

12:51.640 --> 12:55.920
feeling and you see and that's the same like when Sariputta declared oh what a

12:55.920 --> 13:01.200
pleasure what a pleasure and the dying I think in the suit is asking would you

13:01.200 --> 13:04.400
what's pleasure says Nibana it's it's pleasure it's like but didn't you on

13:04.400 --> 13:08.360
another occasion say Nibana there is nothing felt and he says yes and that's

13:08.360 --> 13:13.640
what is pleasant the fact there's nothing felt it's it's pleasant so the

13:13.640 --> 13:21.000
understanding of there's no feeling here it's very agreeable and it's it all boils

13:21.000 --> 13:25.520
down to development in regard to the neutral feeling obviously in order to

13:25.520 --> 13:29.240
begin even any development in regard to neutral feeling and being able to do

13:29.240 --> 13:33.920
it and withstand it you need to stop habitually giving into the pleasant

13:33.920 --> 13:40.160
feeling and feeding the thirst for more pleasure and you have to habitually stop

13:40.160 --> 13:45.040
giving in to the feeling of the unpleasant feeling to try to get rid of

13:45.040 --> 13:51.440
it resisting it you are by doing these two things you are equipping yourself to

13:51.440 --> 13:57.000
endure neutrality that's felt neither pleasantly but not unpleasant the

13:57.000 --> 14:03.640
either clarifying it exactly by by enduring it you as I said you're becoming

14:03.640 --> 14:10.320
more familiar with it so non-activity enduring the initial anxiety of boredom

14:10.320 --> 14:17.040
and finding value and even that's what we would say like the solitude is for

14:17.040 --> 14:22.440
somebody who is developed wisdom to start finding pleasure in solitude otherwise

14:22.440 --> 14:28.800
you won't otherwise it's terrifying without a wisdom solitude mind cannot

14:28.800 --> 14:33.800
bear it and again the Buddha did outline what you need to prepare beforehand so

14:33.800 --> 14:38.760
that you can benefit from solitude which is impeccable virtue seeing the danger

14:38.760 --> 14:43.800
in the slightest fault says sure Janas but you know they've usually come with

14:43.800 --> 14:48.240
solitude since restraint right view all these things you develop beforehand and

14:48.240 --> 14:51.240
then if you go to forest remote dwellings when there's only wild

14:51.240 --> 14:56.000
animals living and so on you your mind will not overwhelm you you will be

14:56.000 --> 14:59.640
benefiting from the neutrality of it well if you're in a position where there's

14:59.640 --> 15:03.480
nothing to do basically do you don't need to be top of the forest it often yeah

15:03.480 --> 15:08.360
top like a remote forest empty or an empty hut empty of activity empty of

15:08.360 --> 15:13.440
activity empty of distraction empty of others turning way as they please so

15:13.440 --> 15:18.840
physically removed but yes apartment will do just fine you do want to have the

15:18.840 --> 15:22.440
environment that will support that but again don't think that that will do the

15:22.440 --> 15:25.880
work for you you will be ready for the solitude if you've already practiced

15:25.880 --> 15:31.320
census strain in regard to the world if you have all already endured joys and

15:31.320 --> 15:35.840
griefs in regard to the world without acting out of it habitually that's how

15:35.840 --> 15:41.600
you surmounting not by running into a solitude or hiding in the forest

15:42.760 --> 15:46.060
because sometimes there are people trying to contrast this yes see the

15:46.060 --> 15:48.580
word I say we should go to the remote dwellings and so on because they don't

15:48.580 --> 15:52.600
deal with their own sensory strength and stuff here now that's like the second

15:52.600 --> 15:58.240
group of herd deer herd from that sutter that we did also recently that

15:58.240 --> 16:01.520
shines the bait and runs on top of mountain yeah but there's no wisdom

16:01.520 --> 16:05.840
developed it so sensory straight in regard to the world in regard to the

16:05.840 --> 16:10.560
central poles in regard to dependence on the drawers and so on needs to be

16:10.560 --> 16:15.400
developed and needs to be endured it's gonna be painful because not because of

16:15.400 --> 16:20.840
the sensory strain but because of your dependence on joys of centrality that's

16:20.840 --> 16:26.920
why you suffer when you first restrain yourself you don't suffer because you

16:26.920 --> 16:31.240
say no to yourself you suffer because you've been saying yes to yeah you've

16:31.240 --> 16:36.320
been saying yes all this time so saying no to yourself just reveals your

16:36.320 --> 16:43.480
addiction your dependence on these gratuitous central joys that you are

16:43.480 --> 16:50.480
responsible that you're fully feeding and maintaining yeah adding to proliferate

16:50.480 --> 16:55.040
so practice towards joylessness

16:56.000 --> 17:02.440
when joylessness is understood it's the utmost peace of gribbility it's nibana

17:02.440 --> 17:10.200
no joy no means joylessness means no delight and it also means no misery and

17:10.200 --> 17:15.520
being unable to be miserable or scared or affected by any type of pain on a

17:15.520 --> 17:21.200
kind of anything including impending death dying you know terminal diagnosis or

17:21.200 --> 17:25.760
whatever else which eventually will have to occur no more prospect of pleasure

17:25.760 --> 17:32.400
well things that are being will be destroyed by death and not things you

17:32.400 --> 17:36.480
depend on anymore why because you removed your dependence on gratuitous joy that

17:36.480 --> 17:41.880
came out of that you removed your delight so joylessness that will die

17:41.880 --> 18:09.720
before you die become joyless and you will be unable to be miserable as well
