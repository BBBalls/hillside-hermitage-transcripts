1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It was a question. If you look at the point of view, it's a niche that applies to the point of view, rather than to things like the book you'll land to you, or leave.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So you need to apply that. If you want to apply, or rather you can say a niche that can apply to both, through the point of view.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So if you want to apply a niche to the things, as it sometimes might have been done, you have to apply only to those things upon which your view depends, upon which your sense of self depends, upon which the center of your experience depends.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Basically, upon things that you took as mine, but it's not a niche that will never be understood in its nature.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you try to approach it, think about it as some sort of law of physics, or whatever, whereby everything is impermanent, thus everything is constantly changing, thus everything will come to an end.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That might be true in theoretical sense, but in terms of freeing it from suffering, that understanding simply won't do.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Because a niche results in freedom from suffering when you see your own sense of self, your own center of experience undermined by it.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But if you look at the random things that you don't care, you have absolutely no emotional connection to whatsoever, like you simply relevant to you, you can see them as impermanent as much as you like, it won't make a big difference.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And that's the thing, as I said before, people associate impermanence with witnessing of the destruction of a thing, witnessing its ending means it's impermanent, but that can never be applied to your own point of view, because they will require you to see your own seeing as impermanent, basically in order to see that you have to see your own seeing ending, you have to see the end of your own seeing.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And that doesn't make it, well, it's impossible. Like, they will require you to step outside of the experience as a whole, the five aggregates, and then see them disappear.

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And they say, okay, they are impermanent, but that's simply inconceivable, because you can't step outside of them, it's just, there is not outside of them.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You only think about outside of the five aggregates, that experience as a whole is within the five aggregates. So then it becomes clear that the impermanence, that the Buddha was teaching about, that does pertain to the five aggregates and freedom from the whole thing, cannot possibly be the impermanence of, oh, I just seen that the thing being destroyed, that's impermanent.

13
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's a worldly impermanence. So in that sense, as I think we discussed before, a Nietzsche, it's much more than just what's thought of, what's thought as impermanence, which means you should probably find a better translation to it, or rather, whatever translation is found, you probably need to be explained heavily, because people already have deeply limited notions of impermanence, or whatever else.

14
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Everything's impermanent. Yeah, everything's impermanent. Yeah, it is, so, but that doesn't really, that doesn't really feel free from suffering, that kind of understanding.

15
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thus, if it's not free from suffering, it's not impermanence of the Buddha was teaching about, that directly results in recognition of not self.

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So Nietzsche is closely related to the lack of control over things, lack of mastery, then it's related to the common notion of impermanence, of witnessing a things ending.

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So yeah, by saying, by experiencing that point of view, by seeing it phenomenologically, phenomenally, you can't say that it is impermanence, or impermanence.

18
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In the sense of all that, no, because there would just be an assumption, because you would have to step out of that point of view, I will see this.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You would have to fall away from the phenomenology, from the mindfulness of that experience, even if you call it permanent.

20
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Even if you call it eternal, you would have to fall away from that experience, because exactly, permanent or impermanent, it's applied to it secondarily as an assumption on top of it, while in reality,

21
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
while in reality, what your experience shows you, it's basically, there is that center of that experience, and that's it.

22
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And there's a sense of infinite, always being there.

23
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Always being there, infinite, infinite sort of appearance, in the terms of infinite possibilities, which means infinite possibilities of being there, which means being there infinitely.

24
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But that is then confused as lasting forever, but no matter how far the thing reaches, like there is no end in sight, that if that whole structure is swept away, means none of it can remain standing.

25
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thus, you don't apply the idea of an idiot, things individually, or things that you can gather through senses, you apply to the structure of your senses.

26
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Exactly. The point of view, and... The point of view, yes, yes.

27
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If that's abandoned and that level, through seeing that you have no control, no mastery over it, you have certainly nothing to do with it's arising, you realize, for that reason, it will come to an end.

28
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, I don't even say, for that reason, it will come to an end, because again, it will induce people to think, oh, so I will witness the end, and you can't even conceive that.

29
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Basically, you better to say, for that reason, it will never be mine.

30
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When you see this truly impermanent, as truly a reason on its own, independent of you, you're absolutely inconceivable for you to have any say in it, is as there.

31
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:32,000
For that reason, it will never, ever be yours, even in a remote wildest of the fantasy, you can't even access it, even in that theoretical idea of ownership, impossible.

32
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And when that realization pervades your mind through and through and through and through, you will simply stop appropriating anything.

33
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No matter what arises on what level, what sense, how, what experience is just the idea of taking it up, it's gone.

34
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And that's all it takes, because it's the point of views.

35
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So when nothing can be taken as mine, no sense of self in that long, infinitely everlasting thing can ever be maintained anymore.

36
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So what you're seeing, as in common to every experience on the more particular level, what you're seeing, the more generally the five aggregates, or one among them, just different aspects of your experience.

37
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But yeah, as a structure, there always have to be there, but then as a structure, there will not be discerned, even as a structure, if those particular things are not a reason, beforehand, not given.

38
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So it feeds itself, mutually determined, depending on where you look at.

39
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And that center, sense of self, it's kind of in the center, it sort of feels like it's always there, it's always seeing these things, witnessing these things or whatever else.

40
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You don't have to deny that, you don't have to try to remove that, in a sense of this is wrong, no it's there, as such.

41
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All you have to do is see that also as something that has a reason on its own, in the result of other things that have already a reason on their own.

42
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's even that sense of self, you can't own. And you certainly, because if you would, again in theory, if you would truly be the master of that sense of self, if you tell it to stop arising, it should stop arising.

43
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you tell it to either they seek you, otherwise like that.

44
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So impermanence is found right in the heart of non-mastery things, like you are not in control of their arising, you are not controlling.

45
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Like you can be in control of, I think we spoke about a few days ago, to various different options that present you, for example, may come down to choosing.

46
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, you can choose this or this or that or that, but what you cannot choose or not choose is the whole structure of choice that you are basically well imprisoned by.

47
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Within you have no choice, either I'm not going to choose, you just chose.

48
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I refrain from any form of choice or action, well, that's a form of choice. So you will keep revolving on it, you can't step outside of it through that choice.

49
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The only way you can step outside through that kind of fully enclosed picture is if you start discerning it from inside as something that actually, well, cannot be used,

50
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
thus, no matter what choices you make, within that, can't pertain to you either.

51
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No, the result of those can eventually pertain to you either, because you abandoned the whole thing, but that is only possible once the moral behavior, the restraint, and see life have been developed and purified beforehand.

52
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because if you just take it abstractly, you can say, okay, so it doesn't matter what I do, it doesn't apply to me. No, it does.

53
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
For as long as your bomb bite, it applies to you. Like there is no, the beginning, there is no discernible beginning of when these things started applying to you.

54
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yet, it is gratuitous setup. That's why a BJ is a gratuitous parasite, as they really called it. So it shouldn't be there, but the fact that it's there means it's there.

55
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Once you undo it, the only reason you're able to undo it is because it was never meant to be there.

56
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Not knowing that it was never meant to be there, you placed it there, and you maintained it there.

57
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When you discern that it actually cannot be there, it's not there.

58
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So through purification of the behavior, of the body, the speech and the mind, then eventually you recognize that no matter what options of your choice are given to you, the nature of the choice is not in your control.

59
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's why you can only choose is good, bad or neutral.

60
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So at any focus choosing good, or wholesome rather, not necessarily good, good, what's accepted, comedy, society is good, but what is awesome, what is non-grade, non-version, non-delusion, that's what you choose.

61
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There are three choices.

62
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, yeah, fundamentally, yeah, there are only three directions. Then within those directions you can have more directions and so on. And that's what confuses people in thinking their own things.

63
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But the fact is that you were thrown within that center, within that inevitability of choice means you don't really own that either.

64
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So what particular choice you make on the result of that inevitability of that choice, it doesn't really matter.

65
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Fundamentally, it matters practically, it matters on a particular level whether it's wholesome or unwholesome, whether it's going to contribute to the maintenance of that delusional view or undermining of the delusional view.

66
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So it matters, in that sense, but fundamentally, from the point of view of the final rate, it doesn't really matter because the nature of the choice is there.

67
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's why somebody who doesn't understand that nature of choice in a band, and he goes beyond good and bad, beyond wholesome and unwholesome.

68
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And you don't have to go far to look for it. Just take up any experience, take the experience right here right now.

69
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There is a sense of, call itself, there is a sense of self, there is a sense of the death which is in common, death which is in common to all of the different experiences you can get through different senses.

70
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's the center of your experience, the knee or the point of view, or if you're more spiritually inclined, you can call it the observer, as is the pure awareness, the knower, whatever else.

71
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Call it whatever you like. If you take it to be yours, that's a problem. If you don't take it to be yours, that's a solution.

72
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So that thing can still remain, because it's inevitable. When there is a point of view, it has to be centered somewhere.

73
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's just that you end up assuming the nature that center has permanent, thus you take it up to be yours.

74
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But there is no center, if there are other things defining the center. You can't even conceive, or this is in the center of what?

75
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If there is nothing defining it, the center will not be decent, at all. It just will not emerge.

76
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So no matter how, and that center can always look the same. Sure, it's always the center of different things, but it's the fact that there are different things, that's what defines the center.

77
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So even your sense of self then is defined by all the other particular things. And certainly, if that sense of self is taken to be mine, to be mine, own self, that's defined by all other particular things that you own, that you took to be mine.

78
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Implicitly, little bit here, little bit there, they all contribute to them, this center of self, that's in common to all of them, feels like, really mine, really personal, really dear to me.

79
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So that's what needs to be removed out of it, not the actual sense of the center of the experience, the ownership of it.

80
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's the problem there. You remove that ownership, and then what you have left it when you recall the individuality.

81
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The center of it, right?

82
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The center of that, those five aggregates, the most common center, the most prevailing characteristic of a center of those five aggregates.

83
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And that's different to different people. So different individuals. Even if it's the same, let's say, if it's two individuals the same, the fact is they are two thus, they're different, there's one, there's two.

84
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Even if they're completely mirrored, it's still two thus, it's two different things, two different individuals.

85
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
In that sense, you can't have like two, two five aggregates to be identical, because if there will be identical, there will be indistinguishable.

86
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, we can't imagine.

87
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, a place where we're by things like experience, a place.

88
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, see, no, not quite. They're not experiencing it.

89
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But these periods of things generates the sense of the center.

90
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Here, here.

91
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Well, again, depends on how they find here. If they find here as opposite of Yonder, then it's not here, because you haven't found it here.

92
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's including, it has to include both, so it would be there.

93
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So that center, it's in regard to particular experiences.

94
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But they're not in the center, nowhere is the center in them.

95
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's just when they're senses, there's a sense of a center in regards to senses, which is exactly how the mind and the senses are kind of arranged.

96
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So to speak, they meet in the mind. They all center in it. They all gather there.

97
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So you can see that even the arrangement of the six senses, the five senses and the mind is the sixth.

98
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Already implies, already reflects that structure of these particular things generating meeting up in the center.

99
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Now the mind would simply not be discerned if there are no five senses.

100
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There will be nothing defining it.

101
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If there is no, well, it's not perfect analogy, but it can give you the idea. If there are no bricks consisting making this little house, you wouldn't have a house.

102
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And you certainly will not have a center in that house. Oh, this is the center of the house, because you remove all the definition of it.

103
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So in that sense, the mind is defined through these five senses, but then at the same time these five senses, well, they would simply not be operable in any way if there is no mind, if there is no the recognition in the mind.

104
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So even that structure already implies the idea of ownership. So you can see how it's not hard to end up assuming the sense of self, the owner, the soul, the me, I am.

105
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Because things are arranged in that way, and then you just have to kind of put that last little touch to it and make a mind.

106
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So that's why I have to go against that grain, against that seeming kind of arrangement of the self in the center, which is basically a deception.

107
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And you go against it, nobody denying this center of experience. You can take, I am, I am me, I am myself. You can take that as a valid phenomenon.

108
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You are, you are yourself. Now, don't take that to be yours. That whole experience of me, I am, you disown that.

109
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So when you disown that personal center, the personality aspects, because there's no ownership in regard to it, and you just have the individual left experience, experience, experience of these very five objects, experience of this point of view, experience of these preferences.

110
00:18:47,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So that's why I am, it's an indistinguishable external position, I can't tell them apart, why wouldn't it? You can be individual without being a person, but you can't be a person without already including individuality in it.

111
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So I'm doing the personal, basically if you appropriate your individuality, you become a person. And the fact that you are already a person is that appropriation is already there, beginningless.

112
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But as you can see, it is good serious. So remove the ownership of your, of your person, of your sense of personality.

113
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
However very good generally it might be, you remove the ownership of it, but you have left this individual. And you remove the ownership of it by seeing that you can't really control it, it doesn't belong to you.

114
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That it could cease at any given moment, enough to make you let go of it, not overdo it and deny its existence, but certainly stop holding it as yours, as something you are in charge of.

115
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So impermanence is, if you want to translate the Nietzsche's impermanence, it's basically closer, more closely related to the things might cease, than actually seeing them cease.

116
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So the fact that you, your own sense of self, might cease, that's enough to disson the nature of impermanence but any to it.

117
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And then you can see that might, and actually you need thing to be present in order to see that it's possible for it to come to an end.

118
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And if you recognize the possibility, that's it, you recognize the nature of impermanence.

119
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But even if it was permanent, you can't imagine how that is. You can't imagine a thing to exist without a possibility to not be. Why? Because it is.

120
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Basically being becomes the reason for its impermanence, arising. If because it has a reason, that's why the possibility of itsization is inherently there in that nature of that arising.

121
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So you don't have to see them cease at all. You just have to recognize them arising. And if you descend that nature, you will see that it is the inherent implicit possibility of them to not be simply because they are right now.

122
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And that possibility, that's enough. In the same sense of that possibility to suffer in the future, it's suffering in itself right now, that possibility.

123
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Like you might feel great today, tomorrow, whatever. You might feel great right now. If you think the next week, there might be something that will cause you to suffer. And that's already form of worry. And worry is unpleasant right here right now.

124
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So it pertains to the same thing. Seeing that, okay, I am here. I'm alive right here right now. So the next week, I might not be. That's it. That's all it takes.

125
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's all. Where? How long has this been going on for? How long will it go on for?

126
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That's exactly that down. Yeah, that little down. Well, that little down. See, if you look at it, yeah, if you look even closer, you can see how long has this been, doesn't matter.

127
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Means for as long as it has been going on for, there was always possibility for it to not be. And for that reason, for as long as it was going on for, it was impermanent.

128
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And because it was impermanent in that sense, you have no control over it. That's why it was suffering.

129
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So in the same sense, as if you have no control over it. Possibilities. I can control this or that. But I can control all possible possibilities that might before this experience.

130
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You're just inconceivable because control is secondarily to this possibility. It's defined by the possibilities, your choice, which is a synonym for people who produce a synonym with control.

131
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's defined by things that are possible or not possible. You can't choose that, which is not possible. Yet those possibilities aren't very uncertain.

132
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So they undermine not just your present experience, but even your possible choice in regard to those possibilities. It's determined by the possibilities.

133
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So usually people could discern possibilities based on the present experience. That's the way it has to be.

134
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And the more you discern, it becomes apparent that structurally, possibilities precede the experience as it has a reason. They're more primordial.

135
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Then if they're simultaneously present, it doesn't mean that possibilities come first and then this thing follow later.

136
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Now they simultaneously arise, but possibilities are more general in the nature, which means they're deeper, so to speak, in terms of the structure. They're more fundamental.

137
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So the nature of a possible.

138
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And that's really permanent. That's what nature suffering is.

139
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And if it's seen as such, means right here, right now, this center, this me, this self, will not be mine.

140
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Will not feel mine.

141
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So is it possible for you sitting right here right now? Is it possible for you to die in the next two minutes? Well, in the next in-breath.

142
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Is it possible?

143
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Well, no, you do know if it's possible or not. But you don't know. That's what I'm saying. Well, there's not even a doubt. There's just been kind of obstinately blind.

144
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Because if you look at it closely, you don't know that you might die, but see, the fact is that you don't know that you might die means you might die.

145
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And the fact that you might die, the fact that there is 50-50, say, or the fact that it's like one percentage, you might die. Still, there is one chance in 100 that you might be dead.

146
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That's enough to see this very center of yourself right here, right now, as you speak, as you doubt, as you think about death, as not being yours.

147
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Not being able to be yours. Because if it were truly yours, there would be simply no possibility of death pertaining to it.

148
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So you can doubt. If you want to doubt whether you can die next moment or not, it's better to turn it differently and then doubt whether you're going to be alive the next moment or not.

149
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Because it's the same thing. It's obvious you can see by doubting whether mortal or not, you give priority to a sense of self.

150
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But if you doubt whether I'm mortal or not, you give priority to death. You give priority to a non-sense of self. It's the same thing.

151
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I said it in the same way for that reason. Actually, you can doubt whether you're going to die or you can doubt if you're going to be alive.

152
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So is it possible for you to be alive next moment? Maybe not me.

153
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Exactly. So maybe not. That's it. That's what importance is.

154
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But I might not be alive, rather than I might die. Well, if you acknowledge to it properly, then you can ask either way.

155
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But the reason why I said differently is because, yeah, you said like many people would say, well, I don't know.

156
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm here now and you know, maybe that experience of death has still been here. Maybe that's it. The fact that it's maybe for you right here right now means maybe not.

157
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And if it means maybe not means you're not in control of it. And if you're not in control of it, you can't be using the future as a possibility and certainly not yours right here right now.

158
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And then you can look well. You were certainly not mine, even in the past. That's where the audience's knowledge pertains to, you know, the present knowledge pertains and pervades his past and the future.

159
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He doesn't even think, even before he was in the other hand, when he remembers his protrusion at the time, he doesn't think I was back then either. Because that sense of abandoning ownership of your sense of self, he just prevents the whole structure present, past his present and future is present and present is present.

160
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So you can say this sense of self, this center of my experience just feels so real, so permanent, he's just eternal, been around all the time.

161
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And they're all not developed in terms of how it feels. It's not up for debate, but what it is, what is up for debate is if it's going to stay like that or not. And even if you assume well, since all I can remember, it was this sense of self, thus this sense of self will continue.

162
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:09,000
That will be an assumption, always. Because as I said, well, maybe you won't. And then maybe is enough for you to discern, if you look closely enough, the impermanence of it, just because there is the tiny little thread of maybe in it.

163
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And if you start looking at it closer, it will longer and longer. Well, it would be less or less of a thread to become more or more like a proper foundation of the experience, the full-on structure of that maybe.

164
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And if it was if everything sits upon maybe, I can't own it. I can own only that which was given beforehand. Or rather, I can entertain the idea of ownership in regard to that which was given beforehand, which means even that entertained idea of ownership is the result of that which was given beforehand, which was already affected by that maybe.

165
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:03,000
That's my whole ownership is not really mine because it could have been otherwise. And that's the pilot-handed scholars' kind of argue over that. It will not be it won't be mine.

166
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Not just so much.

167
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Not just so much on the other side.

168
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So, it's not mine right here right now because it was affected by that maybe.

169
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So whatever it's in the future, it will certainly not be mine.

170
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Even if it's mine, so to speak.

171
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Even if it has a reason for me given, and I could ever say it's my choice, it will not be for me.

172
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because it was affected by that inherent possibility of maybe not.

173
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So if everything that arises is maybe, maybe for you, maybe not.

174
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Means that which has a reason as for you, it's not for you either.

175
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Because it could have been not.

176
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And there's a similar one when the Buddha, the other one,

177
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The more things that you haven't seen.

178
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He said that more things that you haven't seen.

179
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Other more things that you haven't heard than the ones that you heard.

180
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Of course, there are more things that haven't a reason for my senses than the things that have a reason.

181
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And the Buddha said, for that very reason, you abandon everything that has a reason.

182
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,480
a reason in the past, everything arises now and everything that will arise in the future

183
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,720
while because those things that have an arisen will always remain more numerous, which means

184
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,000
if you go back to what I just said about this possibility of maybe not, maybe yes, maybe

185
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,080
it will persist, maybe it will arise in the same way, maybe it won't.

186
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,960
Means whatever does arise, there will always be possibility of it not being, those possibilities

187
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,160
will be always more numerous.

188
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,000
So then the possibility of maybe not is actually much faster than everything that has arisen

189
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,800
and then you start looking at your whole experience, like say you, not just this life, but you

190
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,000
can look all of the lives you've been around, you can look at the whole thing is completely

191
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
circumstantial.

192
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,680
A reason, but it could have not and that could have not was much faster, much greater than

193
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,880
that which did manifest at some point in time.

194
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,320
And then you can think about the future as well, whatever does arise, if you do continue

195
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,640
living for a while, whatever does arise, it will arise on the ground of that much faster

196
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
non-erizing.

197
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:36,880
That's whatever it's given no matter how great, how long it will, how painful, how frightening

198
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,760
it could have not been and that could have not been and it wouldn't have been for me,

199
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,960
it's much greater.

200
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:51,560
So it could have not been and that which did come to be, it certainly not for me because

201
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,280
it came on the basis of all the things that haven't even manifested.

202
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,480
Thus that which manifests, it's completely circumstantial determined by all of it that

203
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,120
didn't manifest.

204
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,840
And so it certainly cannot be mine or for me or special in that sense, because every

205
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,520
sense of ownership is special, it's mine.

206
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,200
I, like even if it takes a sense of self, means yeah, that's why I can see the ego revolve

207
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,040
around the appropriation of your own sense of self, you feel special.

208
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,800
But if you look at the whole thing, including a sense of completely circumstantial random,

209
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:30,080
uncertainty, uncertainty, uncertainty, uncertainty, maybe, yes.

210
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,760
But again, I'm sure I didn't share, well, I'm not sure because I never met you, but based

211
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:43,960
on other things that I did read of his transcripts, I'm pretty positive that he meant it in

212
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:49,520
a right way when he said, mine everything, I'm sure, I'm sure.

213
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,680
Obviously people now just say that as a sort of mantra, but as you can see, you need to

214
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:01,480
do a bit of drilling and digging in order for this maybe or I'm sure or uncertain to start

215
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
to apply correctly.

216
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,480
I do, as you just be denying everything, oh, whatever, what time you come in, I'm sure,

217
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
I'm sure.

218
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
What's that?

219
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Yeah.

220
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
It's like something to eat today.

221
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
No.

222
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
I'm certain about it.

223
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Yeah, I'm a certain about it.

224
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Well, are you uncertain about your uncertainty?

225
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Yeah.

226
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Because obviously you think it is.

227
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Yeah.

228
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,080
Because you can be taking your sense of uncertainty as me is mine, see.

229
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,080
I'm not attached to anything and you're attached to the view, I'm not attached to anything.

230
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
Yeah.

231
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,080
It makes it be more than that, but yeah, yeah, it comes down to that.

232
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,240
The fact that it's, it was always affected by me, it means whatever has a reason.

233
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,880
It was more likely to not be.

234
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,560
And because there's always a greater likelihood of things not being, you can, you can, you

235
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,200
can then realize, well, there's nothing I can own.

236
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,880
There's nothing that will entertain, nothing that will escape this uncertainty.

237
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,720
What if it's with me for hundreds of years, well, like there was, like there were last

238
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,880
four years, and years, and yeah, sure, they forget that they were born, because they've

239
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,000
been around for so long, they're memory-religious, and they do think they're eternal for

240
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
that reason.

241
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,760
Well, it's not accidental that people then entertain the kind of notions of eternity when

242
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,120
it comes to the sense of self and the soul, because yeah, it's always, it's always like

243
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,960
all these particular things might be arising or whatever, and I can see them being destroyed,

244
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,560
but they sense the self remains there.

245
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,640
But there's always possibility for it to not remain there, and you don't look at that

246
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,200
possibility, because if people start looking at the possibility that they might die, they

247
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,680
start freaking out.

248
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:42,440
Because yeah, going back to what's the possibility that I might die, or death might happen to me.

249
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,280
Yeah, that again, you might be, you might be better to ask, am I still going to be alive?

250
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Yeah, because I'll say death will happen to you.

251
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,240
It's a center, it shifts the center of the question, that will happen to me, then it becomes

252
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,480
death becomes another external experience that you witness thus you remain permanent,

253
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,920
thus you remain unaffected by that death, which is exactly what people think, they say

254
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,680
everybody dies, I will die.

255
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,280
And then I experience something, and then maybe this kind of weirdness.

256
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,760
So even death will be an experience of me with, or experience that I'm witnessing, that

257
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,240
might sense the self is witnessing, that's my sense of self, we remain eternal.

258
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,720
But if you think, well, will my sense of self remain eternal?

259
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,440
Oh, well, maybe.

260
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,280
And the fact that it's maybe the fact that you can't give 100% certain answer, means that's

261
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
a problem.

262
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,440
And you will never be able to give 100% certain answer of why, because you can doubt it

263
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,640
to begin with.

264
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,560
You can place it in the question by asking, am I?

265
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,360
Because if you are 100% certain, if you are truly the owner, even the question of questioning

266
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,560
that ownership will be inconceivable, because you will own the future in the same sense you're

267
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,680
owning right here, right now, through the present.

268
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,280
So even if you come to the answer, yes, I will live forever.

269
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,480
The fact that you have asked that question beforehand, means that question of, what

270
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,600
other that possibility of maybe preceding is there, which means you can, whatever you come

271
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,600
up with as an answer, it's going to be an assumption, because it was accessible to

272
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,880
doubt.

273
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,760
And by doubting it means you can't really own it, there is no certainty in regard to it.

274
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,840
So by doubting whether you're going to be alive, you recognize that, okay, I'm not in charge

275
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,320
of that.

276
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,360
And even if you convince yourself that you will always be, that your sense of self is eternal,

277
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,280
you realize that can always be placed in question.

278
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,200
Even if you refrain from doing it, the fact that there is a possibility of it being

279
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:50,280
questioned, means it's subject to that maybe.

280
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,080
And if it's subject to that maybe, then it's not certain.

281
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:02,160
And that's what it means, is, is it, any, anything, take any, any, non certainty, any

282
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:12,240
uncertainty, sorry, take any uncertainty, take any uncertainty in regard to anything, of

283
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,520
that nature, it will always be suffering.

284
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,080
Duke or other, let's not call it suffering, because suffering would be an over-translation

285
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,880
in the same sense as in permanence, would be an over-translation.

286
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,360
So let's call it unease.

287
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Any uncertainty is also uneasy.

288
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,680
And if something is uncertain and uneasy, it's calling it like a form of concern, that

289
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,400
cannot possibly be something you are in control of, because control is completely opposite.

290
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,240
Control is, is, control is ownership, control is mastery, control is control.

291
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,600
And certainty, of course, yeah, control, yeah, because if I'm, if I'm in control, this

292
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
is certain.

293
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,400
But say you're driving a car and say, well, it's uncertain that this car will always

294
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,360
go where you, where you sort of steer the wheel, means oh, so I'm not really in control

295
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,160
of it.

296
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,520
Even if 99% of the time you are controlling the car, that one percent of it, no listening

297
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,920
to you means your control was undermined by that relativity.

298
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,920
All the time.

299
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,920
At any given time of your control, it was always undermined by possibility of not being

300
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
your control.

301
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:49,160
Thus, it was never your control in that personal eternal sense.

302
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,120
So well, there it is, the formula.

303
00:39:52,120 --> 00:40:00,000
It might not be, and it might not be for me, it will not be, and it will not be for me.

304
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,640
So as I said, it might not be, and there will not be for me, means a thing is affected

305
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,120
by that uncertainty, by that maybe.

306
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,840
So whatever has a reason right here, right now, it could have not a reason.

307
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:22,800
It was uncertain, okay, it manifests in a certain way, and that's certain, but that whole

308
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,320
certainty is undermined by this more general uncertainty that it could have, like it

309
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,720
could have easily not been.

310
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,800
And you can look at your experience, like whatever you pass, whatever happened to you,

311
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,120
it could have not happened.

312
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,240
And you know, the bad things, everybody wishes that they wouldn't have not, they wouldn't

313
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,360
have happened, and the good things, obviously, you never question.

314
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:50,800
But if you look at the whole thing, impersonally, so to speak, you would recognize that, yeah,

315
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:59,440
it, these things that have a reason, they could have equally not manifested itself.

316
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,840
So you had no say in the arising thus, so the formula that carries on thus, it will not

317
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,240
be, and it will not be for me.

318
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,480
So you recognize that then in the future, whatever arises, it could be on a basis of, it

319
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,160
could have not a reason, and because of that.

320
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,000
So even if it arises in the future, it might arise, sure, but one thing for sure, it will

321
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,560
never arise for you as yours, as mine, because it was always affected by that uncertainty.

322
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,960
So things right here, right now, are affected by that uncertainty.

323
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,520
And then things in the future that arise, if I lived that long, let's say, they might

324
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,960
arise, but one thing for sure is they will not arise as mine, because if they were mine

325
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,720
to begin with, they would never be uncertain, but the fact that you find a certainty first

326
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:56,680
means whatever arises in the future, whatever experience you go through, it's circumstantial,

327
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,720
and as such, it can never be yours.

328
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,480
So you can go through all sorts of experiences, you can live for 200 years, but one thing

329
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,560
you will be certain of is that none of it will be arising for you, I, for your sense

330
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,120
of self, I, for your independent sense of self that exists completely in charge of all

331
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:21,040
these things that are manifesting for you, I, they will not be arising for this center,

332
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,840
I, this center will not be independent of those things that arise.

333
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,520
What's the part of it?

334
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:42,120
The part of the formula is no chance, no chance is here, not by sati, not by sati.

335
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:48,600
So the literal translation, it might not be, and there, there might not be for me, which

336
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,360
is kind of debatable, they can't agree how to translate that.

337
00:42:52,360 --> 00:43:01,280
So it might not be, it might not be for me, it will not be, and it will not be for me.

338
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,880
There's an uncertainty there, so the things are uncertain, right here, right now, you know

339
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,400
things you're certain of, you can doubt that certainty is existing, which means it's

340
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
uncertain.

341
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,480
But it can be certain about that.

342
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,560
Well you can be certain that it will always remain uncertain, which means you can be

343
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,640
certain about the impermanence, which means you can be certain about suffering, which

344
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,720
means you can be certain about not taking anything to be in your control.

345
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,560
Thus Nibbana is, was it a surety, was it a translation of what you're saying?

346
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,160
Like a sure, you're a suret of, I think I've seen that surety, I don't know maybe I'm

347
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:49,840
pronouncing it wrongly, but surety or surety of confidence, basically you are certain,

348
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,320
which is why it's a liberation, it's not actually, it's unshakable.

349
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,520
That form of certainty, certainty that makes you take everything is uncertain as a result

350
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:07,240
of that, makes you not take anything as yours.

351
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:13,920
So the thing is that whatever has a reason, it could have, not a reason, right here right

352
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,280
now, which means whatever does arise in the future, it will be equally affected by that

353
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,960
circumstantial nature, which means whatever arises in the future, then might happen, one

354
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,160
thing for sure, it cannot be learned, why?

355
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,320
Because you can doubt it right here right now, pretty much exactly what I said before,

356
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:41,600
I just didn't pronounce the form, look at that.

357
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:51,800
For one, with such view, with this view, that it might not be, and no, another thing

358
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,800
is that you can see that this entire form will pertains to the nature of possibility.

359
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,560
It refers to it might not be, it might not be for me, or rather it might not be there,

360
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,040
it might not be for me, it cannot be and they will not be for me.

361
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,200
So it tends to the possibility right here right now, and then the future possibility of

362
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,840
possibilities are even more sort of removed from that sense of ownership, the fact that

363
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:25,080
they are under the big question mark, might, maybe.

364
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,600
So whatever is present right here right now, you can look at it and say, well, yeah, it

365
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:37,040
is present, it is defined, it is a reason, but it was all on the ground of that maybe,

366
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,120
because you realize, well, it could have, it could have not been easily, equally.

367
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,160
In anything, like no matter what it is, you can, because why?

368
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,680
Because you are not in control of your own sense basis.

369
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,800
So no matter what you've seen, Earth tastes tangent, the smell, thought of, you realize,

370
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:02,640
it could have not been why, because the things that, the taste that's seen, like your eye,

371
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:10,760
things that's melt, your nose, things that's thought, your mind, will always uncertain.

372
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,640
In a sense, they will not necessarily persist, and they don't persist, anything that you

373
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,880
access through them is inconceivable.

374
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,800
So obviously, you can't, as you can see, you can't be destroying your own eye to see

375
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,720
the nature of impermanence, that doesn't make sense, because then you won't be able

376
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,160
to see that.

377
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,080
But if you see that there is a, in the heart of it, there is a possibility that it might

378
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,800
not be, then you realize, oh, yeah, that's why I can't own it.

379
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:56,000
Thus, it might not be, automatically means, if it is, it will not be for me, down there.

380
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,080
And what I said, for one, we touch view, it is to be expected that there will be no

381
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,600
attraction towards being for him, and there will be no repulsion towards the station of

382
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:23,080
being in him.

383
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:32,320
So if you put his heart into this, his mind into this understanding, a monk could easily

384
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:45,240
cut the lower fetters, so if you ponder on this long enough, and drill in the standing

385
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:53,160
of it, on and on and on, the Buddha said that he wouldn't be, before long, that monk

386
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,240
could be free from the fire-load of fetters, means on the going of it.

387
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:05,920
And you can see that, if you, if you not just disown everything like here right now, through

388
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,760
the discernment of being it uncertain, being impermanent, you also, anything future,

389
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:20,120
no matter how remote, how unmindful of it, you might be.

390
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:26,600
You disown it as well, through recognition that you can't own it, because it's always

391
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:44,440
coming on the background of, well, maybe not.

392
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,400
And as I said, I didn't think of this, but it's pretty much the same thing when I said

393
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:57,240
that if people to really doubt their own life, in a sense, if they were really putting

394
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,720
question, whether they're going to exist the next moment or not, they'll concern a

395
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:10,000
worry and care for an untrained mind with a rise, because you can, you can be applying it

396
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,520
in that external manner of saying, oh, well, everybody dies, I would die, but you don't

397
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,800
really, you don't really question that point of view, but if you look at the point of

398
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,120
view, your sense of self, your center of experience, their soul, whatever you want to call

399
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:30,200
it, no matter how permanent, how dare, how stable it feels, if you just look at it honestly

400
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:40,320
and say, will it, will this thing be there, next moment, maybe not, and then you know

401
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,400
that if it is there, it will not be for you, because you doubt it, but if somebody, if

402
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,240
an untrained mind can also look in the direction of death, that's what death is, will this center

403
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:59,960
of experience be there, next moment, it might not, that's what dying is, and the Buddha

404
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:08,000
said when the uninstructed commoner becomes, he becomes terrified when there is no ground

405
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,920
for fear, because it should be liberating, but for him, it's frightening, but it's the

406
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,640
same thing they're thinking about, but somebody who is not an uninstructed commoner, if he starts

407
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:23,120
thinking, thinking about this, maybe not, with us, if it is, it will certainly not be for

408
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:28,600
me, because if it were for me, I couldn't have not doubted it in the beginning, to begin

409
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:34,440
with, I couldn't have put it in question at all, and that's, that's liberating, you make

410
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,480
sure, you let go, you stop assuming, you stop appropriating things, for an untrained mind,

411
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,560
if he was, if he were to think, it might not be, and they might not be for me, to not

412
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:53,320
be, and they will not be for me, he experienced terror and fear, because, well, his lack of instruction

413
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,240
means that he still remains fully centered in his sense of self, that he himself now

414
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:05,680
undermined, thoroughly, through putting it in question, oh, it might not be, and that's

415
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,720
just what people freak out, like, now there's people freak out, back in the widest time,

416
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,280
people freak out, they follow the ground with their breasts, put their hair, you know, like

417
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,080
this sort, when you really like, and that's what nature of that is, not seeing other people

418
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:26,000
die, not seeing the ending of other people, putting in question your own, or in non-ending,

419
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,080
imagining your body dying, or imagining your body dying, that's nothing to do with death,

420
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:39,400
no, if your own mind that does that imagining, like, you realize that that has a reason

421
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:45,360
on the ground of, maybe, could have not a reason, thus, when it does the right in the future,

422
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,080
it might not arise in the future, if it does arise in the future, it will not arise

423
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:55,760
as mine, thus, I will not be, and that's, that's, that's, like, terrifying, for those who

424
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,200
still hold that sense of, I am, that sense of soul, that sense of the center of experience

425
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,300
they will die, they, they, they lose it, and that was said, but instructing nobody's

426
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:11,280
eyeball, he does not become terrified, when he, when he, it's not terrifying for him

427
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,520
to think, it might not be, and there might not be for me, it will not be, and there

428
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:23,240
will not be for me, and it's just a confirmation of what he already instructed himself in,

429
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:48,720
thank you for suffering.
