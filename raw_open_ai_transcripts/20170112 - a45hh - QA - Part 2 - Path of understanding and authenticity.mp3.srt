1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
But can you explain the practice of samadhai, the basanam?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sure. Well, you can start by sort of applying a blanket.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Or maybe I just, I will start with some idea which I do.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, so yeah, you can do that.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So it was after you know talking with you about this phenomenological approach,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in the pafero, I was still considering that actually to practice just simple,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and upon a meditation as I used to do it, you know, just relax,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
staying in the present is your briefing.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's actually still a good thing to do in your spare time.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But seems that you have something to say about it.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think what I say is that, yeah, yeah, well basically most,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
more often than not, it won't be a good thing because you won't do it mindfully.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like if you go into an object of meditation, whatever that might be,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and if you want to do it just to sort of calm down and well not,

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
yeah, you can do it, but on the basis of mindfulness.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And the basis of mindfulness as we've been discussing all these previous talks

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
is the basis of the awareness of the paerifero.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So as I said yesterday, sure, you can't possibly sustain,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
although you could, surprise yourself,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but your amount of energy you can invest in sort of repetition of this discernment

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
of the paerifero in regard to actual and actual in regard to paerifero

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so that you fully sort of keep drilling that in,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
training and drilling and training and drilling.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So, but say you're tired of it, so then yes, you stop actively pursuing the discernment of that principle,

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but you don't then turn completely away and then become unmindful,

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
become unaware of the principle.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because that means you're not mindful.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That means when you go to meditate, if you meditate without being aware of the principle,

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you meditate without mindfulness, which means that's not meditation at all.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But it can be still awesome activity.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You know, you are not engaged.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, I'm sure desire is between something unholy, something...

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, it's also in a very relative manner.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's awesome because only because you don't engage in sensual desire.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But it remains very much on wholesome,

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
because you won't take you out of the putugena status.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Nor will it take you out of the wrong view.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
On the contrary, it will probably keep perpetuating the wrong view.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's why the Buddha said those meditators,

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
summoners and Brahmins without the right view,

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
they end up meditating...

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They think they meditate by the end of premeditating,

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
overmeditating, mismeditating, undermeditating,

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and all of those kind of permutations.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because why?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The mind is still bound with sensuality,

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
with the notions of self, with all the wrong assumptions,

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and they meditate with that.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So a putugena cannot meditate with a pure mind,

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
because he doesn't have such a thing.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He doesn't even have a concept of what phenomenon of the mind is.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But he could purify his mind by practicing jhanas.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, and jhanas are nothing other,

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
than fully established upon the principle of mindfulness,

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
which is the principle we've been discussing,

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which I think maybe was even recorded.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I explained to you that extending the same awareness

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
of the peripheral legato,

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
you can go as far as to their casinos.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The four great elements,

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the element of consciousness,

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
which is the most refined one,

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
told the jhanas to the immaterial,

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and mindful establishments.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's the extending the mind along the same principle.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's why the sari puting, one by one,

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
that's the imaginary kaya,

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
goes to the first jhana,

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and then he kind of,

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
oh, the recognize the factors that are there,

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and says this is all kind of being held by mindfulness,

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and then he's there beyond,

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and then following the same principle says,

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
yeah, there is beyond.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So then he goes, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi,

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
until obviously with his right view,

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
he reaches to the cessation of perception and feeling,

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
which is obviously that there is not beyond that,

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
when things cease.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But that's just to see how far this great structure,

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
kind of structures itself,

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
is there beyond this?

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes,

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
up to the infinite space,

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the infinite consciousness,

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
now the perception and not perception.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All those things in the regard to mind

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
being developed in regard to the peripheral,

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
because when you're able to sort of reach,

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and it's not like it's abstract now,

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
because the mind is not developed,

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
but for the developed mind,

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
reaching the verges of the phenomenon of space,

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
goes into the infinite space.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The verges of the perception,

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
surmounting the perceptions of unity and diversity,

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
doesn't matter in particular,

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
general nature of perceptions,

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
surmounted, you reach a base of neither perception

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
nor perception.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So Janus, that's why the good phrase is Janus,

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because even, sure,

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you don't need necessarily the right view,

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
but in order to do them,

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
you're doing them along the right view,

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
along the right principle,

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
along the principle of partition part,

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
along the principles of semantics,

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
sensuality, semantics,

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the master, I am of the experience,

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
many sort of say that,

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I am cannot be present in the Janus,

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
it ceases beforehand,

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
that's where the monetized Janus and so on.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So that's why the good phrase is that,

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
because if you were to develop Janus as protagonists,

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
then you would need very, very little instruction

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to put it all together

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and become probably not right away,

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
because the mind is already developed

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
to such an extent

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that has amounted the domain of sensuality,

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
has fully understood the nature of Salatina,

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and it's impermanent and so on.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So it's very important to recognize that,

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the tutuja cannot meditate rightly,

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
unless he is a sotpan.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, that's a strong statement.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, well, you don't need to go further

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
than some of it is so fancy,

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that right view makes everything right.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, so it's not my statement,

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
it's the whole suit about it.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So how can you meditate rightly if you have no review?

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And the story.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But it can mean it without you knowing

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that you are meditating rightly,

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you just meditate and prepare your mind

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
for a crying effect.

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, if you don't know it,

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
well, if right view is about the knowledge,

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
if liberation is about the knowledge,

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
how can you be knowing while not knowing?

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How can you be doing it rightly while not knowing?

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you are not knowing all the instructions of good heart.

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, the one who understands those instructions

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is the sotapana.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Nobody shortens in that,

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
which means you follow something you haven't understood.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So how can you follow it?

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If I give you instruction and you make no sense out of it,

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
how can you perform it?

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because you just follow instructions.

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, no, it means some task to do

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and I don't understand.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Exactly, I just say you won't do the task rightly.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If the task is based upon you understanding the task,

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
like the Buddha didn't say,

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
just perform these mechanical things

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and you get to the final result.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He said, understand what I'm teaching you,

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and then you will be your own kind of leader,

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
your own sort of guide to the final task.

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So what you are sort of talking about

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
would be as if the Buddha gave this in person,

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
in person, sort of set of methods and instructions

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
that you can just stick to it and you will arrive at it.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But he didn't.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He did give instructions that need to be understood.

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hence the right view comes first.

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And he said himself,

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
in Samadhi Sutra,

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
why some samadhi right?

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's because of the right view.

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So without the right view,

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
you cannot meditate rightly.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But on the other hand,

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I have no say but but but.

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But on the other hand,

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
we have quite a few examples of people

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
who had Janas,

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and there is the Buddha Janas.

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, that's what I said.

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So theoretically, as putugana,

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you can develop Janas.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can develop the full understanding of this principle

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and develop your mind.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And not necessarily,

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
until somebody tells you externally,

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
turn that to the nature of the sense of self.

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's why putugana can be free

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
from all the other rupadanas,

194
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
except the rupadana of the self.

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There is a sutra,

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but I think it's Imaginika,

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
or maybe Angutra.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Not sure.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But putugana can be free from sensuality,

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
can be free from silabat paramasa.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He cannot be free

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
from the self-view.

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because for that,

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you need utterance of another.

205
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I see.

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But he will have very much of Ayurveda,

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Manasikara,

208
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
if he had Janas.

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's why, like say Janas,

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
they are the four Janas,

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
but then you have even,

212
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
kind of, more refined immaterial attainments.

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's why when the Buddha became the Buddha,

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
when the Brahma pleaded to him to go and teach,

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
he generated,

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
who should I teach?

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So there are putuganas,

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
but which ones had the least dust in their eyes?

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So he turned to his previous teacher,

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
not out of some traditional gratitude,

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
or anything like that.

222
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, because he had the least dust in his eyes,

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
he was the basis of neither perception

224
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or perception.

225
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you realize,

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
as a putugana,

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
he was really, really,

228
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
he had done 99.9% of work

229
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that Arahana needs to do.

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All he needed is just that

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
1, 0.1% to set everything right.

232
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He already had.

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So when they told him,

234
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the day was told him he died,

235
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
he said, why,

236
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
it's a really great loss for him.

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I mean,

238
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
unimaginable loss,

239
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
because he actually was so, so close

240
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
to this very thing.

241
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Then he went down the next one,

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
which is the base of infinite space,

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
wherever it was,

244
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
all for the purpose,

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
because they had

246
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
did done all the work mostly.

247
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And that's why when they do have people in the suit

248
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
as they heard,

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
just one line from the Buddha

250
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and became Arahana,

251
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it's because they've done all the work,

252
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
rightly.

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So they developed the whole understanding

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that resulted in the whole freedom of

255
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Upadana and everything.

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
They just needed the last drop.

257
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So they did a lot of right understanding.

258
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Really?

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes, of course.

260
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Well,

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Buddha comes to you and tells you

262
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
in seeing, let there be the scene,

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
in herd, let there only be the herd.

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And you understand that, right there and then.

265
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You won't be able to understand that

266
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
if you have many wrong views blocking it,

267
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
covering it up.

268
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But if you clear all the wrong views,

269
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
but you're not still quite there yet,

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and then somebody tells you that,

271
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and you understand it as clear as a day,

272
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
as they tell to you.

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can only do that if the mind is able to

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
sort of reach it at that level.

275
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And it can reach it at that level,

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
if it made the right effort.

277
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's why again,

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you should keep trying to meditate

279
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and keep trying to sort of understand

280
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
along the lines of understanding,

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
not along the lines of mechanical technique

282
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
that you hope is purifying your mind

283
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
somewhere down the line.

284
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Because even if we were,

285
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
you have no right criteria.

286
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You don't have right view to recognize

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
what the actual purity is.

288
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So even if it sits in your face,

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
you won't recognize it.

290
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It seems that I can't agree with this statement

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that last one you said about.

293
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I will show you my other thing,

294
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
which I used to,

295
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
or which I have.

296
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was thinking that you purify your mind

297
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
so never enough,

298
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and by purifying your mind

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
so never enough,

300
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you will remove your obstacles.

301
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And then you can,

302
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
well,

303
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
sure, that's not wrong statement to make,

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but purifying your mind

305
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
of never enough is done

306
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
by understanding what never enough is.

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But fully understanding the nature,

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
you're surmounted.

309
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's why Mahamogalana entered the first jhana

310
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
by understanding what the first jhana was.

311
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Not by doing this or that.

312
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Or going on a retreat,

313
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
or watching souls of his feet.

314
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
By understanding the nature of the first jhana,

315
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
he entered the first jhana.

316
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So can he say that actually overcoming,

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
you overcoming by understanding what nivarana is,

318
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
means that you don't overcome them by technique,

319
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
by just practicing some meditation.

320
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Exactly.

321
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Exactly.

322
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You overcome by understanding them.

323
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's how the mind develops in regard to it.

324
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And understanding can take place only on the basis

325
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
of principle of the Titsamapara,

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the basis of principle of understanding

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
that a reason phenomena as it has a reason,

328
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
which means on the basis of mindfulness,

329
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
which means on the basis of

330
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
discerning peripheral in regard to the actual,

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
or actually in regard to peripheral.

332
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Because nivaranas are also phenomena

333
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
that are manifested in your visit experience as a whole.

334
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So if you understand it there,

335
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
on the basis of the experience as a whole,

336
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
you remove the ownership of it.

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You remove sort of their influence over you,

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
but not only in them.

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

340
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because you give them power by taking possession of them.

341
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Or I'm involved about sotapana

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and then separately in regard to nivaranas.

343
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah.

344
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
To an extent.

345
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
To an extent.

346
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So you have understood it.

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But as I said before,

348
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
even with this principle that you can kind of understand,

349
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
you still didn't fully understand it, didn't you?

350
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Because you haven't repeated it long enough.

351
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So that's why an Arya,

352
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
who is still not an Arhan,

353
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
still has work to do.

354
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He still needs to keep re-engaging

355
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
in repeating of the same principle of the same understanding

356
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that he has, which is why nobody else can be his guide,

357
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
not even Buddha.

358
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He himself.

359
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Because he got a criteria.

360
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He got a principle.

361
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He got a base for it.

362
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He got an understanding.

363
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He just needs to keep drilling it.

364
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So just keep drilling it.

365
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Exactly.

366
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's why the Buddha we passed see before he became

367
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
some of some Buddha.

368
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He discerned,

369
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
but it's some part.

370
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And in that deepening kaisuta,

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
he disclosed,

372
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
but it's some part.

373
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And he comes to the point of

374
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Nama Rupa, the term is Vinyana,

375
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and Vinyana, the term is Nama Rupa.

376
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And then he doesn't define,

377
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but it's some part of further.

378
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And then he says,

379
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
but understanding that,

380
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
he remained contemplating

381
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
manifestation,

382
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I arising and ceasing of the five degrees,

383
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
of the experience as a whole,

384
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
until his mind was purified

385
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
from all of the kilesas,

386
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and he became some of some Buddha.

387
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So if you understood the principle,

388
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
then just remain drilling it.

389
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And it doesn't say,

390
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
he remained drilling,

391
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
but it's an opada.

392
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It says,

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
he understood,

394
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
but it's an opada.

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Nama Rupa Vinyana Vinyana,

396
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and then he remained just

397
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
mindful of arising and falling

398
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
of the five arguments.

399
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

400
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Of the enduring of the five arguments,

401
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
of persisting, of changing,

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
of the five arguments,

403
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
being independent of any

404
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
sort of notion of mind

405
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and myself,

406
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
he fully drilled that

407
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to the extent necessary

408
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
for the final knowledge

409
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and then a second,

410
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
he was done.

411
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So can we say that,

412
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
or basically the essence,

413
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
the point is to

414
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
understand that structure

415
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
of experience,

416
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and then understanding,

417
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that's the point.

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's why, like,

419
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I mean,

420
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
it's kind of unfortunate

421
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that this needs to be said,

422
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
not like to be particular

423
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
about any generally,

424
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
because yeah,

425
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
many people,

426
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
when you read so much in every

427
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
certain, just like,

428
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
the final knowledge,

429
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
the final knowledge,

430
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the final understanding,

431
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Puthujana can relate

432
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
to knowledge.

433
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Just think about the phenomenon

434
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
of knowledge,

435
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
means when you know something.

436
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So then, you must not

437
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
abandon that notion of knowledge,

438
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
when you're pursuing

439
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the way out of suffering.

440
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
As appealing as it is

441
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to giving to an impersonal

442
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
mechanical technique

443
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
that sort of numbs you out

444
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
for a while,

445
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
makes it very peaceful,

446
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
it's a very, very dangerous path

447
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
to take, because you become

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
dependent upon it,

449
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in that pleasure,

450
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that forgetfulness,

451
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
that oblivion.

452
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So initially,

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
everything seems painful

454
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
because you want to know

455
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
everything, but you can't,

456
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
but it's on the basis of that,

457
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
that you can actually

458
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
be certain important

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
from unimportant,

460
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
which is an

461
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
description for Puthujana.

462
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like, I,

463
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
what's important knowledge,

464
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
what it isn't.

465
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But it's still,

466
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
sorry,

467
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
but it still is the knowledge.

468
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So,

469
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to answer your original question

470
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
about Samatha and Vipassana,

471
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Vipassana is actively

472
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
pursuing the discernment

473
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
of those principles,

474
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
whatever approach you take,

475
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
the five aggregates

476
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
from Puthujana

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
or the referral and actual,

478
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
anything that's based

479
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
on mindfulness,

480
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
that's where you can

481
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
not have too much of mindfulness

482
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and that's where mindfulness

483
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
is always first,

484
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
basically,

485
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
in whatever list they come up.

486
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So, Vipassana will be actively

487
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
pursuing the discernment

488
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
while Samatha will be

489
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
not actively pursuing

490
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the discernment

491
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
containing the basis

492
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
for discernment.

493
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So, if you maintain the

494
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
basis for discernment,

495
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but not exerting yourself

496
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
in understanding,

497
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
you will progress a bit slower

498
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
in terms of understanding,

499
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but nevertheless,

500
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you eventually start seeing those things,

501
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
why? Because you know

502
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
where you're supposed to see,

503
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and you keep holding it

504
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
in front of you.

505
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Even if you're not necessarily

506
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
trying to see,

507
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
you still hold all the components

508
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
rightly in front of you,

509
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
in Samatha.

510
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's where Samatha carries

511
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Vipassana,

512
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
vice versa,

513
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
actively pursuing Vipassana

514
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
means you composing that

515
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
principle and keeping it

516
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in front of you,

517
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
means Vipassana is

518
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
dragging Samatha with it.

519
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And it's not optional,

520
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
if done rightly.

521
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's where it's like

522
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
the two yolks,

523
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
yolk to the two,

524
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
two lobsters.

525
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So, one might go slightly forward

526
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and another might,

527
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
that doesn't matter.

528
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
They will both be going forward.

529
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But if you engage in any form

530
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
of Samatha,

531
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that is not based on mindfulness,

532
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
not based on maintaining

533
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
the same principles,

534
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
even if you don't necessarily

535
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
actively pursue them,

536
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
well, you have no basis

537
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
for any Vipassana,

538
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
which means that's

539
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
not Samatha.

540
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's Patujan Samatha.

541
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's his premeditation

542
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
or meditation under meditation

543
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and so on.

544
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And that cannot possibly

545
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
magically sort of transfer you

546
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
into the right,

547
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
right way of meditating.

548
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You just couldn't.

549
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So, I will just try to

550
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
stay in my own words

551
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
if I go there.

552
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So, that mindfulness

553
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you are talking about,

554
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
is actually the mindfulness

555
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
of this principle.

556
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Mindfulness is, yes, mindfulness

557
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is in common to Vipassana

558
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and to Samatha.

559
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's where every Jhana,

560
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
it's not properly,

561
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
which is what Jhana is,

562
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
when it's not properly,

563
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
has mindfulness as its basis.

564
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And you read that,

565
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
you read one by one,

566
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
sort of you read other,

567
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
sort of mindfulness

568
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
is present in every Jhana.

569
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So, must be basically

570
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
founded upon it.

571
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So, instead of thinking

572
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
what kind of

573
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
contemporary sort of

574
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Buddhist schools think

575
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and teach,

576
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that meditation

577
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
is some sort of concentration,

578
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
that makes you focus

579
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
upon something

580
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
that you forget everything else.

581
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Think about meditation

582
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Samatha literally means

583
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
composure.

584
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But if you're composing something,

585
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
you need components for that,

586
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
something needs to be composed.

587
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Something needs to be kept there,

588
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
composed.

589
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And it's your mind,

590
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it's the principally

591
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
understanding of mindfulness

592
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that we spoke about before.

593
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So, think of Samatha

594
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
or Samatha.

595
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Think of Samatha

596
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
or Samatha as unwavering mindfulness.

597
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Not actively engaging

598
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
on the basis that mindfulness

599
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
is just being mindful.

600
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So, mindfulness enduring.

601
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Mindfulness is the

602
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
secret of mindfulness.

603
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah, not like it doesn't

604
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
change at all.

605
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes.

606
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It changes while remaining

607
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
the same.

608
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Because mindfulness

609
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
is another phenomena.

610
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's work.

611
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mindful of experience

612
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
is a whole which is the phenomena

613
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
that is present.

614
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Is it not to be

615
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
right focused on one particular thing?

616
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But just to

617
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
actual and peripheral means

618
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
you see basically

619
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
from one point of view

620
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
you see both ends.

621
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You don't have to

622
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
chase them.

623
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes.

624
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You don't have to step into

625
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the peripheral

626
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and forget about actual

627
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and chase actual

628
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and forget about peripheral.

629
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like, the other one,

630
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
what was the

631
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
that similarly?

632
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, think about the other

633
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
similarly, basically, which can

634
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
serve the purpose

635
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
like a gatekeeper.

636
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You don't chase people

637
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
outside of the city

638
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
or inside the city.

639
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You just stay at one point

640
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
from which you know

641
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
whoever passes here

642
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
is inside,

643
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
whoever goes out

644
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is outside.

645
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's all you need to know.

646
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yes.

647
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So, in the same sense,

648
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that's how

649
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you establish your mindfulness.

650
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Now, by chasing the

651
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
particular sensations

652
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
or whatever

653
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
perceptions,

654
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
but by being mindful

655
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
of the basis of them.

656
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And whatever.

657
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And they can change as fast

658
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
as they want.

659
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You won't lose your

660
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
mindfulness.

661
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes.

662
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Because you haven't

663
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
based your mindfulness

664
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
on such a fleeting,

665
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
particular notion.

666
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But, on a more general

667
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
of fundamental

668
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
recognition of the

669
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
experience as a whole,

670
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
which is a basis

671
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
for these things changing.

672
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So, you don't care

673
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
how they change.

674
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You know, they have to

675
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
change inside of the city.

676
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because they have

677
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
a reason.

678
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They cease.

679
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They gone.

680
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Now, they're not my concern.

681
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes.

682
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And what about

683
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
wholesome and unwholesome?

684
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The relationship

685
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
between my influence

686
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and wholesome and unwholesome

687
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
states.

688
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You know, because that

689
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
gatekeeper needs

690
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
actually out

691
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
words and others.

692
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
In order to get

693
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
sort of this kind of mindfulness,

694
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
they've established,

695
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
developed and established.

696
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Unwholesome habits,

697
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
unwholesome behavior,

698
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
unwholesome engaging

699
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
with unwholesome need to

700
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
have been already

701
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
kept at bay.

702
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Obviously, sometimes,

703
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you sleep, you engage

704
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
in unwholesome.

705
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If you have right mindfulness,

706
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
it will be quicker for you

707
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
to kind of readjust.

708
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And reset.

709
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And start doing things

710
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
rightly.

711
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's the case for an

712
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
area.

713
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We can quickly pick back,

714
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
pick up the training,

715
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
back.

716
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And do it even

717
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
after a slip.

718
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So, for Patujan,

719
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
he needs to purify

720
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
his behavior beforehand.

721
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He needs to have been

722
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
engaging in a pure

723
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
behavior in a sense

724
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
of not getting into

725
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the unwholesome.

726
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And as we spoke,

727
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
a few days ago,

728
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
there is an unwholesome.

729
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah, there is the obvious

730
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
unwholesome.

731
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But often, that unwholesome

732
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
is actually determined

733
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
by the state of your mind.

734
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Whether it's rooted

735
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
in desire,

736
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
in craving,

737
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
or if it's not rooted

738
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
in desire, in craving.

739
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So, that's what you become,

740
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
aware of.

741
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Not like, kind of,

742
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
oh, well, everybody says

743
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
this is fine,

744
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and I'll do it.

745
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah.

746
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
No, you know you'll be doing

747
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
it for the wrong reasons.

748
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes.

749
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The reasons of pursuing

750
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
distraction,

751
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
carelessness,

752
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
whatever,

753
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and feeling justified about it.

754
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No, no, no, no.

755
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That needs to go.

756
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah.

757
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then these things

758
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
can take root,

759
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
if you,

760
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
if you obviously apply,

761
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
apply the effort.

762
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's why the suitors

763
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
say that he practiced

764
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
restraint,

765
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
by the rules of Patujan,

766
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
he sees the danger

767
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
in the slightest fault.

768
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yes.

769
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Which means, basically,

770
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
even the slightest

771
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
danger in the slightest

772
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
giving into the desire.

773
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yes, actually,

774
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
that you are not

775
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
able to do anything.

776
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It doesn't mean you don't

777
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
do anything.

778
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It means you just do

779
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
things that are not

780
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
rooted in your

781
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
unhulsing desire.

782
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah.

783
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah.

784
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So if you want to go

785
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
for a walk,

786
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
because, well,

787
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
because you are

788
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
basically feel too lazy

789
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to read the suitors

790
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
or maybe all you can,

791
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
they run in front of you,

792
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
you want to go for a walk

793
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and then,

794
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
that's okay.

795
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It is a compromise,

796
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
you can see.

797
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Going for a walk,

798
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
depending,

799
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
like you want to go

800
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
into the wilderness,

801
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
well, that's not necessarily,

802
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
you're not going to

803
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
have any kind of

804
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
sensual distractions there.

805
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So, you could sort of

806
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
do that compromise,

807
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
because it's quite

808
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
likely in the wilderness,

809
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
your mind will go back

810
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
to the dharma.

811
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But, say, you go

812
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
for a walk and you

813
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
choose to go to the village.

814
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And then, you realize,

815
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
well, you will be

816
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
meeting people,

817
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
you will be engaging

818
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
with it.

819
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So, you might not

820
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
give rise to any

821
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
seriously unhulsing desire,

822
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
or an offense,

823
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
or something like that.

824
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But nevertheless,

825
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
you're going for the purpose

826
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
of socializing,

827
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
turning your mind away

828
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
from the practice,

829
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
giving in

830
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
to distraction of others.

831
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So, that's unhulsing.

832
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
If, for example,

833
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you want to go to the

834
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
wilderness because you want

835
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
to practice further,

836
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
then it's same.

837
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Again, you go for a

838
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
same walk,

839
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
but now it's

840
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
based in wholesome.

841
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's done for good

842
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
reason.

843
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So, you become

844
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
responsible for

845
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
rooting it.

846
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Or, like, you live in

847
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
the monastery.

848
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You live in a big temple.

849
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Most, like, the

850
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
temples that have

851
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
a library,

852
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Buddhist libraries

853
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
every book you want.

854
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So, you are in your

855
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
boredom, the pressure,

856
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
the dread starts to

857
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
come up anxiety.

858
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You're a bit tired.

859
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You can't keep making

860
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
the effort.

861
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So, well, you know,

862
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
it's obvious you'll feel

863
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
too guilty if you just

864
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
go to the

865
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
salon or reception

866
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
room where people are.

867
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But, no, you go to the

868
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
library to get the book.

869
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But, deep down,

870
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
or not even that deep down,

871
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
just underneath that,

872
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
you hope that you will

873
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
meet people in library

874
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
to get somebody to talk

875
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
to and get your mind

876
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
off things.

877
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Now, if you say that,

878
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
you're going to

879
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
library to take some

880
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
practice.

881
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Nobody will criticise

882
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
that.

883
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Everyone will say,

884
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
yeah, very well.

885
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He's really making the

886
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
effort.

887
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But, you know, that actually

888
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
you're doing it for

889
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
completely wrong reasons.

890
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So, then you shouldn't

891
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
do it.

892
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because there will be a

893
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
fault.

894
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But, sometimes, you don't

895
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
know actually because you

896
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
don't know.

897
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Well, you have to know.

898
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's not necessarily

899
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
you don't need a great

900
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
wisdom of a

901
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
sort of an

902
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
argument to discern that.

903
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You just need to be

904
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
honest to yourself.

905
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's why that,

906
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
the mundane right view

907
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
is required for any

908
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
other right for you to

909
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
take place.

910
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That recognition,

911
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
that kind of

912
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
admitting things to

913
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
yourself,

914
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
being transparent to

915
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
yourself, or as a

916
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
university, being authentic.

917
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So, you recognize why

918
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
am I going to library?

919
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What is the main

920
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
reason?

921
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.

922
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And that's why, like, once

923
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
you say,

924
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
develop in the transparency,

925
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
that's where, you know,

926
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
the contemplation of the

927
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
food.

928
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Like, you can't help,

929
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
but eat.

930
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You have to eat,

931
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
because otherwise you'll

932
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
die.

933
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And then, you can eat

934
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
for unwholesome reasons,

935
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
or you can make the effort

936
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and re-root the reasons

937
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
for your eating,

938
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
that are necessary.

939
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Root them forcefully

940
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
if you have to,

941
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
in wholesome.

942
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Don't give rights

943
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
to the desire,

944
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and root them in wholesome.

945
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Root them in the purpose

946
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
of your practice,

947
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
purpose of this life,

948
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
purpose of your commitment.

949
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That's why you eat.

950
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So, to remain healthy,

951
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
affliction-free,

952
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
so that you can practice.

953
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So, it's not like,

954
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
or eating is bad,

955
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
or eating is good.

956
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You make it so.

957
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
If you remain mindful of,

958
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and if you're mindful of these,

959
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
more general vague reasons,

960
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
why you eat,

961
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
like, or to be coming out

962
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
hunting, to do this,

963
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and to be able to practice,

964
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and to be able to

965
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
apply myself,

966
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
then the desire can creep in.

967
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If you become mindful,

968
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
goes back to the default,

969
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
which is with the grain,

970
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
which is with the flood,

971
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
which is with the desire,

972
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
with the taste,

973
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
with the thirst.

974
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So, in the same sense,

975
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
sometimes you might

976
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
actually have to go

977
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
to the library.

978
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You really want to get these

979
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
sutras,

980
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
but you've been carefully

981
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
attending to that,

982
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
unmindfully,

983
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and the real reason

984
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
becomes meeting other people.

985
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So, then you have to re-roach it.

986
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Then you have to keep bringing back

987
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
the other reason for getting

988
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
the sutra books,

989
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and then go to the library,

990
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and if you do meet other people,

991
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
you may therefore know engaging

992
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
with them, avoiding them,

993
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
taking the books,

994
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and getting out.

995
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Is this Sila Mata Paramasabh?

996
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Well, it's within this.

997
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

998
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah.

999
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah.

1000
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
If you fully develop this

1001
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
principle of transparency,

1002
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
paired with understanding of the

1003
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
base of mindfulness,

1004
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
there would reveal the sign of the mind,

1005
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
the notion of the phenomenon

1006
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
of the mind.

1007
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Then you would recognize exactly

1008
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
where the purpose of

1009
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Sila, the virtue,

1010
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and the butter,

1011
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
the duties, is.

1012
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You would recognize it,

1013
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and you wouldn't need to hold on to it,

1014
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
because it took responsibility

1015
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
for the whole thing.

1016
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But if you don't recognize it,

1017
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
that's when people say,

1018
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
no, no, no.

1019
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But it's always good to go

1020
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and take the sutra.

1021
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's always good to be virtues.

1022
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yes.

1023
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It is always good to be virtues.

1024
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It is always good to read the sutras.

1025
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But the putugin as a mind can make

1026
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
even that unwholesome.

1027
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
If it doesn't know that fundamentally,

1028
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
wholesome unwholesome is rooted in desire.

1029
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So unwholesome is always rooted in desire.

1030
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And then in hindsight,

1031
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
you can recognize it.

1032
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, yes, of course.

1033
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
A sensuality of any kind,

1034
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
anger,

1035
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
ill will of any kind,

1036
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
cruelty of any kind.

1037
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's always rooted in desire.

1038
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You cannot re-root the reasons for that.

1039
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That's why you stop doing them beforehand.

1040
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You take that on trust,

1041
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
so that you can develop that understanding.

1042
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Not just so that you can blindly

1043
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
adhere to it for the rest of your life.

1044
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yes.

1045
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Because they will not serve as a basis for wisdom

1046
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and knowledge.

1047
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
They will talk about it.

1048
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So in that sense,

1049
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
the behavior needs to be purified beforehand,

1050
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and then obviously the practice of the

1051
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
disseminate the principle,

1052
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
the composure of the principle,

1053
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and the kind of the knowledge of the principle

1054
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:56,000
eventually can take the place.
