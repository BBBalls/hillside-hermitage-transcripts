1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,240
No, especially in the beginning, like when you actually start developing the concept

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,480
of celibacy or the idea that this is what you should be striving at, they come a point

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,920
the whole world will feel upside down when it comes to that, like any confidence that

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,320
you build and whatever else, it just completely gets undone. And yeah, one look at it, one

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:40,400
eye content, it's enough to crack it, completely overwhelmed you. For a good, well, in the beginning

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,440
at least, it will blow down to enduring it, not pursuing it in any way, and also not

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,440
pursuing it physically, not looking for the loophole, and then as the as the suitors would

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,240
often say, seeing the danger in the slightest fault, and that means like if you have an attitude

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,160
of looking for a loophole, even if you're not necessarily pursuing any loophole that you

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,680
might find, that attitude is already on hold some state of looking for a loophole, means

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,160
ah, you're not seeing the danger in the slightest fault, means you're looking for a letter

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,720
of the rule to keep you from breaking it, or to allow your loophole, while actually you

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,640
should look for the origin of such action, which is your own mind, which is whether it's

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,440
rooted in wholesome, or unwholesome. And if you're looking for a loophole, it's definitely

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,600
rooted in a wholesome, because you know, like there was that, I was just talking with

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,480
Tanya the other day, and ah, you know, the rules for the monks evolved, they were not

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:51,640
always 200, and ah, 27, there was 150 before, or less, and ah, there was the whole, ah,

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,680
the whole point was, they were kind of a product of circumstances and so on, but they were,

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,920
they were the basic principles, the A-principles, for example, are the basic principles, and

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,880
they were, they were, they were, that monk couldn't keep all 150, whatever it was, and I thought

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,600
that it was before others, the former, and he went to the Buddha and said, it's too much,

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm going to this rope, because I can't keep all these rules, ah, and then the Buddha

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,000
said, well, you can just keep the three rules, don't do anything unwholesome, by body, by

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,240
speech or by mind, and that's it. Or then another occasion, when Mahvajapati went to

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,480
ask the Buddha for a brief instruction before she goes for a little retreat, and so she

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,800
can commit to the practice, and he said, whatever you know, it's unwholesome, abandoning

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,040
whatever you know, it's wholesome, don't look out for it, and there was enough for her

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:51,200
to become another hand, because it comes down, all the way down, deep inside, to your thought.

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,080
Obviously, you have to have enough mindfulness established to be recognizing thoughts as

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,720
things, as phenomena that has arisen, but once you do, then you can actually see, and

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,400
it's not, if you do see the level, it won't require them, it's much harder to restrain

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
after your thoughts have been taken up, your level of the speech has been taken up, and

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,640
ah, you're just kind of not quite doing unwholesome things with your body, so you're just

34
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,560
enduring this buildup. But when you go back down to where your thoughts are, it's literally

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,600
just like with the stream, where the river just originates, when it's a tiny little stream,

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,240
and then it doesn't require much effort to stop it, but it doesn't require discernment

37
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:44,040
to spot it. So, when you go to the origin, if you say, that is where you can see that

38
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,780
you are responsible for. Oh yeah, that's when you see that you are the one making

39
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:59,840
unwholesome or unwholesome, accepting unwholesome, ignoring wholesomeism and so on. So, in

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,120
the beginning, you have to kind of start by like, you know, crude restraint, just not

41
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,640
doing, not looking, not saying whatever else, but that's like, that's far from being a

42
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,360
goal in itself. You do all of that just to eventually, through practice of mindfulness

43
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,880
and reading the sutras and developing and understanding of the Dharma, you can start

44
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,600
distinguishing these things in your thoughts already rooted in it. And if at that level

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,480
you address and literally just abstain from unwholesome on the level of the thoughts, that's

46
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:37,000
already like a straight path in itself. But that really does mean throughout the day,

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,800
you have to be mindful of your thoughts and then when you recognize it, unwholesome thoughts

48
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,280
just, you don't tolerate it. Doesn't mean you shouldn't be feeling like this or you

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,480
should, oh, these thoughts are wrong, I was a big mistake. No, you're nothing to do

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,680
with their arising, thoughts arise and cease. You have to, a lot to do with, exactly,

51
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,880
with their accepting, like you accept the pleasing ones, you don't accept ones, you don't

52
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,800
accept ones, you don't want. But then you change the criteria, when you reach to their

53
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,600
level, you change the criteria. So, it's not any more what I want, what I don't want,

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,800
it's what I know it's wholesome and what I know it's unwholesome. So, whatever it's unwholesome,

55
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,880
you don't want it. And the Buddha said, the deal German, he doesn't entertain such thoughts,

56
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,320
he doesn't indulge in them, he doesn't welcome them, he doesn't wish for them. And so on,

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,080
which means they might have a reason, but by him not entertaining them in any shape or form,

58
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:40,800
this is. So, no engagement with unwholesome has taken place. And if no engagement of unwholesome

59
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,680
takes place at that very deep root level, where it's certainly nothing can kind of, of the same

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,480
kind, happen further down the stream. Why? Because the stream hasn't been polluted in its origin,

61
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,720
it means even at the very end it will be still the clean wholesome streams.

62
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,200
So, and that pertains to any type of thoughts, whether it's, when it type of unwholesome thoughts,

63
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:12,720
whether it's essential thoughts, thought of ill will and anger, malice, thought of delusion,

64
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,040
like just just thoughts that are kind of revolving on indolence, laziness, indulgence of any kind.

65
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,000
You know that those unwholesome thoughts and you accept them. And that's how the five hindrances

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,960
work as well. They arise on their own. They're like almost manifestations of, you know, having a

67
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:41,040
body. The body gets tired, the body gets excited, the body gets agitated and so on. But you enter

68
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:53,440
painting that. What was that was it? That's, that's a double wing moth. It sounds like a double wing

69
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,160
plane as well. So, basically by, but the five hindrances, by not entertaining them,

70
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:08,160
they cease to be hindrances. They cease to be obstacles. And the mind rises above them.

71
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,400
That's what's bothering me, I'm entertaining it. It's just that. Yeah, you are, you are.

72
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,240
It's, it's certain in the beginning. I do, I do at times I would like force myself not to pursue it.

73
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,920
I further carry on with it, like, you know, whatever I'm, I've been thinking thinking and, you know,

74
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not carrying forward with this forward. And, you know, it makes some effort,

75
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,160
but I do it. And I feel a bit, please, like, you know, a bit happy or whatever, but,

76
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:49,120
and I see that I had to keep doing it. And, you know, but it's just the fact that my day is spent

77
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,480
just on that, just struggle that, like, either pursuing it or struggling with it. You know,

78
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm not doing it practically anything else. Yeah, well, that's, that's basically the,

79
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,640
the environment you live in. The, you know, the, the common household, it exposure to, you know,

80
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,640
pretty much any sensual aspect you want, food, music, entertainment.

81
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:25,600
So, you need to, yeah, you need to re-evaluate, see how serious you are. And then you have to change it,

82
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,760
you have to take that leap, that step, and then change it. And by changing, I mean, you go to the

83
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:40,240
environment that doesn't support such an easy access to those things. So, it's a, it's a risky step,

84
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,760
obviously, but then again, like, yeah, you can choose to stay and then what? You're not going to live

85
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,480
forever, you know, way down. So, what, you're just going to be setting and indulging every, every

86
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,680
window, the risers, and giving completely in, which is the hating yourself. The day before that,

87
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,080
the day before that. Yeah. No, the thing that I see myself developing in a way, like, as you said,

88
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,440
like that, the rest of the sensual stuff, I'm doing pretty decent. Like, even the food-wise,

89
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,200
at times I see, like, I'm trying to, you know, trying to enjoy, and I like, I'll take a step back,

90
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,040
you know, and like, music and the other really, and to say, and, you know, other sensual stuff,

91
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm handling well. Yeah, the problem is, you will not, if you're waiting for yourself to feel,

92
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,680
like, oh, I am ready now, they'll never come. Actually, I think I'm really afraid,

93
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:43,920
it's going like, because this is probably like my, from going to Australia, that's probably my,

94
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,160
I'm on the opportunity, I can't, can't invest again, I don't have the money. Yeah, I know, I was in the

95
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,760
very, very, very similar position. I mean, I had one shot at it. I don't want to, like, go there,

96
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,880
and I see, you know, if I see some, you know, women coming, stay at them, or whatever, and offend them,

97
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,760
and, you know, do some opportunity. Yeah, yeah, all that, all that is a little risk. So,

98
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,000
that's just something you have to, well, you have to accept really, and then face it,

99
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,200
exactly, and then be stronger than it. Because if you wait, or I'm just waiting for the circumstances

100
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,880
to be right for me to feel ready to go, it'll never happen, because, you know, your whole mind

101
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,040
is taken by matter, which means it'll never make you ready for it. It's always going to be something,

102
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,520
and often you have, I mean, I've seen so many people coming to monasteries over the years,

103
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,640
and they always kind of come and sort of are looking for a place, but they have the attitude of,

104
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,960
they're looking for a perfect place, they're looking for a place that will do the practice for them,

105
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,160
which means they'll never find that place, which means they'll never actually start the practice,

106
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,520
and they know that. You kind of, by putting the responsibility for the practice onto circumstances,

107
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,400
be it a place, or if everything falls in place, I can really go and do it or what else,

108
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,800
you'll never do it. It will never be perfect. Why? Because your judgment of perfection is actually

109
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,560
skewed. It's, it's unhulsing. So what you're waiting to be perfect can never happen, because

110
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,840
if it will happen, means that the matter would encourage you to practice, and they will never

111
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:38,800
happen. The matter will never encourage you to go against them. It will always make it hard,

112
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,920
whenever you choose to go against the stream, which is why it's referred to as against the stream.

113
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,800
So that against the stream starts from the very first step. So you might be inspired about it,

114
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,320
you might have determination to do it, but it will never be, oh yes, I'm going with the grain now,

115
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,840
and I'm practicing, no, it always has to be against it, which is why it's risky, it's not a

116
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,240
guarantee, it's a success. So you don't really know when you do make that step, whether you made it too

117
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,840
soon, or whether, you know, am I too late, or is it just, but then at the same time, well,

118
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,400
you don't really know what too soon is, you don't really know what too late is. One thing you know

119
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,160
is, it's going to be hard, and one thing you know is, well, you can always prevail, and that's it.

120
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,000
So if you fail, it's not because it was too soon, it's not because it was too late, it's because

121
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,840
you failed, it's because you didn't prevail, you didn't overwhelm you, you didn't overwhelm it,

122
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,960
and that's it, the development, exactly. So you know enough, I'm not like not specifically

123
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:54,560
look like one knows enough, you have the idea about the monastic life, what it entails,

124
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,960
what the priests are, where the practices to be found, and that's it. So you might be doubt,

125
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,520
so whatever else, but all that comes from those hindrances I was just talking about.

126
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,600
So it all boils down whether you succeed or not in the end, and for that you are solely responsible.

127
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,440
For as long as your senses, your faculties are intact, you still have your life and so on,

128
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,520
means there's absolutely no reason to not succeed. So if you don't succeed then yeah,

129
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,680
you'll have this reason, and that reason, too soon, too late, and this, and that,

130
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,280
if you succeed, none of it matters. Why? Because none of it matters to begin with.

131
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,720
If the practice was truly depending upon circumstances, as well, to be done,

132
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,640
you wouldn't be able to do it. So unless your faculties are impaired,

133
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,960
anything like that happens, then yeah, there's nothing really stopping you from doing it,

134
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:06,800
it's just very strong enough or not. I see, I see a lot of similarities with any sort of like

135
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:17,040
intoxicant, like, you know, I see myself trying to stop, then yeah, like, and, well, actually,

136
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,680
the nature of addiction is well within the nature of sensuality in general. Addiction is just a

137
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,920
particular manifestation of the nature of sensuality. Any addiction is just a more concentrated

138
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:41,040
manifestation of what actually nature of sensuality is. I see myself like wanting one last

139
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:55,680
hit, one last time, and when I get there, I won't know. I see what you mean, like, unless I take the

140
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:08,160
step, it doesn't really seem going to change. You might like, oh, it's just one last hit of whatever

141
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,440
was providing me with a hit, and then I'll do it. But that was already, like, flowed attitude to

142
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,800
begin with. That hit is something that, once you get it, well, now there is a prospect of another

143
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,720
last hit, because this was not last anymore. It was last before you'd done it. Once you've done it,

144
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,960
well, now is a possibility of another hit, which is, oh, well, there will be the last hit.

145
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:40,880
So you never stop. So you realize, well, the only way to stop is to stop. The last hit won't stop

146
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,720
you. The first hit, the hundred won't know. The way to stop is to stop, and not give importance

147
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,200
whether it's a beginning of the hit, end of the hit, or middle of the hit. Now you stop independent

148
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,480
off the hit. And that's what I was just saying about circumstances. You stop regardless of

149
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,360
the circumstances, whether it's, whether it feels like I was just halfway through this or through that, now,

150
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,640
just stop.

151
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,600
Yeah, you have to go above it, I guess, I think, to become, yeah, you have to take the range really and do it.

152
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,880
Because otherwise he's just riding you around. Yeah, you can't, you can't have someone who's

153
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,120
an Aryan or a noble, noble person who is being led by his caretaker. Oh, come, you know, he's

154
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:47,120
not like that. An Aryan is a strong person. Yes, he's not, he's not weak. And so by the beginning

155
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,040
of the argument, you always have to do, you know, you have to go above things, they're basically

156
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,360
anything that promotes that. Yeah, that's why the Buddha would say, and this is like, you know,

157
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,280
whatever was to be obtained by the manly effort, manly exhaustion, I have a pain.

158
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,200
It's got nothing to do. And there isn't a greater manly effort than going against, you know,

159
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:16,480
yourself. The going against the entire grain. And then all we're powering, there's another

160
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:26,000
sutra where the Buddha says the mind of the Aryan doesn't overwhelm him, he overwhelms his mind.

161
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,920
Means whatever arises in the mind, he's strong in the neck. Obviously that strength can't

162
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,680
come to his force. He's going against it. It comes through like direct discern, full insight,

163
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:46,800
which which all the power is, isn't it? What about like faith in like the beginning, you know,

164
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:53,760
you've done it. Faith is necessary in the beginning. Obviously not faith is not a goal in itself

165
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,360
as it is in Christianity and many other religions. It's just faith that there is hope,

166
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,960
that if I make the effort, I can be free. So I have faith in that. I have faith that my efforts are

167
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,200
leading me the right way. But then when you know for fact, when your efforts are confirmed,

168
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,320
when you know that you are on the right way, then the faith is automatically, well faith disappears.

169
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,480
Because you don't need to believe that you're on the right way when you know that you're on the

170
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,200
right way. So confidence, knowledge replaces the faith. And the sutras refer to as confirmed

171
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,600
confidence. It's sort of when it gets and then develops further and further and further.

172
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,040
When it just went for the light, that is a big thing, isn't it?

173
00:18:49,040 --> 00:19:03,760
It's just a big thing, isn't it? Well, it's actually two phases. And then ultimately for an

174
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:12,640
other hand, you know, he has no faith anymore because he became fully developed in regard to

175
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:26,800
dominant practice. He completely went against the grain and now he can't. He just can't be overwhelmed

176
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,040
in a sense. He can't be brought back with the grain anymore. He can't be pulled everywhere.

177
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:43,120
He just went beyond. Like the noble aid for path goes against the grain and then for an other hand, he goes beyond

178
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,400
the noble aid for path. So grain against the grain and then there is completely going over it and

179
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,240
that's it. You can't get back.

180
00:19:50,240 --> 00:20:05,440
Do some, like I asked myself, I can say with central thoughts. Well, I've asked myself in fact,

181
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:16,880
do I want to actually get beyond those things? Do I really want to go beyond that? Do I want to be free

182
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:25,280
from sensuality? And then yours, yeah. Well, there's a good reflection and it reminded, you know,

183
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,760
on a daily basis because as I was just saying, any form of sensuality in a wholesome is being

184
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,240
entertained, which is why it's present. It arises on its own. But if you're feeling a central pool

185
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,560
of any kind or a pool of ill will or anger means up, you have already accepted it. You've already

186
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:52,080
entertaining it. So then the reminder, well, hold on. Do I want to go beyond this genuinely? Yes.

187
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,560
Then you'll well, then entertaining it becomes more obvious and then you you kind of won't do it.

188
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,400
Obviously, you know, the more you do it, the more like the more you refrain from entertaining the

189
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,800
more the more of practicing that inside, then you become more proficient at it and it gets easier.

190
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,720
But in the beginning, yeah, it's just like really enduring it when it arises and then trying to

191
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:27,520
make the most of it when it's not present. Most of it in terms of practice, I mean. But you're like,

192
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,600
what is what is sensuality ever done for you? You throw your arm

193
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:43,840
endlessly. Yeah. And you've had it. You've had it before. What more is it going to do?

194
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,360
You know, what is it going to achieve? We're just talking about it a few minutes, I think,

195
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:58,240
before we start, is according like any form of sensuality of any sense kind of has its

196
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,520
combination like taste, sound, touch. So you realize it's never going to be more than that.

197
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:15,280
So what then differs is just like having different ways of arriving at that combination.

198
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,680
Like different ways of obtaining taste, different ways of obtaining touch, different ways of

199
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:30,880
obtaining sounds, smells and so on. So it's just like it becomes an indulgent

200
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,800
anticipation of something that you've been through many times before. So then that's why you need

201
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:46,400
to like people kind of become really like connoisseurs of how really taking slowly, sorry,

202
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,240
because if you just arrive at the end of it, it says, oh, that's it. So you have to build up that

203
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,280
anticipation, that delight. And that's what sensuality is, delighting in the prospect.

204
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:06,720
So that's why a lot of people spend lots of time masking and developing various elaborate ways

205
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,640
of arriving at something plain and simple. Like just a combination of the pleasure of any particular

206
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,080
sense. And that's it. That's all. If you approach it like that, then it's quite flat actually.

207
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,520
So you have to refrain from that attainment, not from delighting in the prospect of it.

208
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,000
And attaining it, you know, teasing it, leaving it for longer. So then you can kind of have

209
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,920
greater pleasure. But again, the nature of that pleasure inherently will always remain the same

210
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:50,160
and can never be anything more than that. And you know, obviously the extent people go

211
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,880
for the central pleasure is just having family and children, everything. It all comes as a result of that.

212
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,360
And those are serious commitments, serious actions that affect other people.

213
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,080
But it all touches, oh, I want the kids, I want this, I want family, I want people,

214
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,640
next to me, I want companions, whatever else. And it's a form of just kind of

215
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,080
getting to that pleasure. You commit to all sorts of things to great extents.

216
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,320
And then when you get it, then you live as well. Now you're too deep in to just leave it all out.

217
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,920
Why? On a kind of sensuality. You just went too far.

218
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:35,760
To admit it, it took too much on. The burn is too heavy and you can't turn away from it anymore.

219
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,720
But even then it's not impossible. Like it's easier when you don't have many things

220
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,160
pulling you back in terms of responsibilities, but say even if you're a king of the ruler of

221
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:55,680
the entire country with lives and kids or whatever else. Again, nothing stops you from a decision

222
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,680
made in a moment to just leave it all behind. As the Buddha did.

223
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:14,000
Let alone, if you have much less responsibilities and opportunities as he did,

224
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:32,400
all people like it. Like becoming an anticipator, like being professional anticipating things.

225
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,920
Yeah, that's really what runs people's lives, anticipation, which is, you know, delight,

226
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:46,080
like you delight at the future prospect. Oh, I'm going to like I'm about to have this. I'm

227
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,000
going to have it. That anticipation, like always having something in stores. It's how people

228
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,920
live their entire lives. Whether in terms of relationships, whether in terms of, you know,

229
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:06,320
cross-family, career, ambition, achievements, money, obviously, like anticipation,

230
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:14,960
making money, learning, studying, learning, whatever else. Just all of those things are forms of

231
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,600
anticipation, right? But if you just stop and think you're doing this, well, there is never an

232
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,200
arrival to anything, because that anticipation is actually almost a goal in itself.

233
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,360
Yeah, that's what you do. That delight is what centrality is. That anticipation is the

234
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,560
centrality. It's not the pleasure that you get from it. It's that pool and being shackled by that

235
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,920
anticipation. That's what centrality is. Pleasure is just pleasure. It fully pertains to the senses,

236
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,760
and that's it. But that anticipation is that is something for which you're responsible. The

237
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:59,520
you're entertaining, the you're engaging, and the driving around completely. Desire and lust, in regard to the things,

238
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,680
the light, and the prospect of pleasure. That's what centrality is. Not the actual pleasure.

239
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,760
So yeah, what is the point? What is what is what do you get from giving up centrality?

240
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:23,680
Well, like, again, that's it. I want to have one last hit because I'm giving it up forever.

241
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,520
That's how it feels in the beginning. But if you stop and think about it, you realize, well,

242
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:37,040
what you give it up forever is the anticipation revolving around chasing things up,

243
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,640
this kind of hope and expectation. The actual pleasure that was always pertaining to the senses

244
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,680
remains on the level of senses, and you don't mind giving that up because it was just that.

245
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,280
But the fear arises when because people are dependent upon anticipation and having this kind of

246
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,000
something in store, like something waiting, something hopeful to happen.

247
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:13,600
And giving that up feels you be dreaded, feels with anxiety, because like, oh, well, boredom is like

248
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,720
nothing then. It's just this. It's just plain boredom. There is no pleasure here at all.

249
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,120
Because for you, pleasure is the pleasure of anticipation, and that is the unwholesome pleasure.

250
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,400
Like craving for underlying tendencies, craving for more. Which means whenever there is anticipation,

251
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,120
there will be more anticipation in regards to that. More delight, breathe more delight.

252
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,680
And that's why it's unwholesome.

253
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,800
So only from the point of view of that, giving up pleasure feels like fearful, feels you with fear.

254
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,960
It seems like hope. But only the beginning. Yeah, because it feels like you're giving up hope.

255
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,720
But that's the thing. If you persevere for it, and not even that long actually, you realize, well,

256
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,960
the senses, they're ultimately the only thing that can experience this pleasure are still there,

257
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,880
whatever. So you don't really, like, they will not use to begin with. So you don't fear giving up

258
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,360
their pleasure, because they'll have something else. And they will have other types of pleasure,

259
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,400
they're not unwholesome. Which is why when you start discerning those types of pleasure,

260
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,360
you can, well, that's how you abandon the unwholesome value. But developing wholesome pleasure,

261
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,400
that it's not based on anticipation. Pleasure of peace, pleasure of content, pleasure of

262
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:42,240
renunciation, all of those forms of pleasure. And you can actually use them to abandon the unwholesome

263
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,920
types of pleasure. So you need those pleasures at least at least. Well, first you need to start

264
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:55,920
the renunciation. You need to start to emulate it. And then you can start recognizing the pleasant

265
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:03,280
aspect of it on account of that wholesome pleasant aspect. You abandon the unwholesome pleasant

266
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:11,520
aspects, which are pleasant pleasures of anticipation, sensuality, delight, chasing, after things,

267
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:28,080
and so on. And the hope that that provides...

268
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,440
It seems like such a big challenge. There's the biggest, it's the most difficult things to do.

269
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:43,440
It's overcome, sensuality, it's overcome anticipation, overcome craving. And how many people can do that?

270
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,560
And people have done that. Yeah. Because it takes so much strength to do that.

271
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,200
But it's far from impossible. Yeah, far from impossible, but it's only like,

272
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,240
there's only a few people can do that. You think about it all. How many people there are currently

273
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:14,400
on the planet? Yeah. Billions are people. And you're the only one. Yeah, you're the only one

274
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:21,840
or two people in the world. It's actually making the efforts in that direction and keening your mind.

275
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:29,920
The rest, they become, you know. No, that's a very, that's like using vanity, using

276
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:36,480
conceit to your advantage. Like I will be the only one free from sensuality. Because of that,

277
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,520
you will be making efforts to free yourself from sensuality and then you can and you will.

278
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,160
And when you free yourself from sensuality, you won't be, I am the only one free, you won't care

279
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,680
about it. If you free from sensuality. So that that vanity they conceit will vanish with it.

280
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,560
But it did make you strive properly. And that everybody can follow their desires.

281
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,000
It's absolutely zero effort involved. Which is why everybody does it.

282
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,920
But then again, you just have to stop and reflect for a just brief period of time and realize,

283
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:18,000
well, yeah, sure. Following desire desires doesn't require any effort.

284
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,760
But in order to have the availability for my desires, I need to put up with lots of stuff that I

285
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,480
hate, that I don't want, that I want to be associated with, I don't want to have to do.

286
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,080
But I do it just that I can have a moment where I can just let it go and just flow with the desire

287
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,880
that has a reason and kind of, you know, relax. But then you spend 85, 90% of your life just

288
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,040
putting up with stuff you hate, you don't want so that you can get that 5% satisfaction of just

289
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,360
having your own way and satisfying this particular desire or that particular desire.

290
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah, people work the entire week hard so they can completely, you know,

291
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,440
bring angle man over the weekend and that's their whole life.

292
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,440
Be the master of your weekend.

293
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,920
Yeah, exactly, I mean, that's like the course is kind of example, but basically in principle,

294
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,760
that's the protusion as they like. Like, putting up with stuff, why? Because you want

295
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,920
the family, you want the wife, you want the children, well, now I have to support it,

296
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,600
now I have to work for it, now I have to endure lots of stuff you hate because you committed to this.

297
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:33,760
And you sort of, you think, again, without much reflection or effort,

298
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:41,920
you recognize, well, with little bit of effort, with 5% of effort, I can have 95% of my time

299
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,200
not putting up with stuff I hate actually being quite free. That's why they would have compared

300
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,320
like life with someone else and especially if somebody would develop wisdom and inside,

301
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,400
like, free as a deer, roaming as a deer, just go wherever you please, whenever you please,

302
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,440
you're your own master. It's basically what everybody dreams of,

303
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,240
but because being too weak in regard to their own desires, they end up making compromises,

304
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,280
they end up being the burden, their ways down on them, and then you're stuck. It crushes you,

305
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:27,520
eventually. In the beginning, the overcome the defilement, how do you overcome the fear of the

306
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:35,120
defilement? To overcome the defilement, how do you overcome the fear of the defilement?

307
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:46,160
Yeah. What do you mean? Like, for example, the sensuality. If you fear, the sensuality takes

308
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,720
you over and even sort of a life. Well, you don't have to overcome. You use that fear to not engage

309
00:34:52,720 --> 00:35:02,320
you sensuality. You develop more until the sensuality frightens you so much that you do not give it,

310
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:11,120
as seeing the danger in the slightest fault, seeing the threat in the slightest fault, being afraid of

311
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:19,120
the slightest fault. And then eventually, when you stop giving into those faults, then that fear will

312
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:33,920
fail. Because now you're confident that you will not give in, thus you're not going to fear.

313
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,200
That is a heavy rain. Yeah.

314
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,320
It doesn't seem like a five-minute rain in Bamborello.

315
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,240
That's right. It's really raining like this now. And that's still dry. That's good.

316
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,800
Hear the trees are not getting hit. No, it's not hitting here. See this tree is not good.

317
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,160
Thank you. Excellent.

318
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,880
I also think that authenticity is such a power, you know.

319
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,080
Like, if you're authentic, the more authentic you are, the more powerful you become.

320
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,280
Oh yeah. You know, literally you become powerful.

321
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:44,480
Yeah. And then you know, so even for myself, I know if sensuality comes, if the sexual desire

322
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,080
comes up, I have the power to put it out. Exactly. And again, that's good.

323
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm the one doing it. I'm the one actually bringing it back. I can fit you to all things.

324
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,800
When you develop confidence in your own power, mental power, then you don't fear. And again,

325
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,640
that's the similarly from the suitors often compared to a lion, like the lion, the king of the jungle.

326
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,440
It doesn't fear any other horse that he hears, the rise. Why? Because he is the king of the jungle.

327
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,720
It's his role that others fear. So when he sleeps there, somebody rolls some other animals

328
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,400
making noise, he doesn't even flinch. Because he knows nobody's coming out. Nobody can come after him.

329
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:34,080
So that's when the mind develops, any sensuality, anything that rises like on its own,

330
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,920
you don't fear it because you know, up. You won't overwhelm me. I'll overwhelm that if it comes here.

331
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:56,640
And it doesn't come there.

332
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:54,720
So you have been maintaining a department for so long. And you have been maintaining that particular

333
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:01,840
department quite dedicated to the department.

334
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:16,160
The staff has to be a graduate of sort of a life, to say, coming off that department.

335
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,920
Well, I mean, as I said, you stop things when you stop them.

336
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:35,520
You're not kind of waning off it, waiting for it to kind of fade out and stop and do the stopping for you.

337
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,280
So yeah, the longer you've been entertaining a particular habit, a fun wholesome time,

338
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,240
it will be harder to give it up. But you give it up when you give it up.

339
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,080
You stop doing it and then you just endure and you have to withstand any pull.

340
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,640
And those pulls can't last forever. They won't last forever. They will last for as long as

341
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:10,000
the strength of them lasts. And that strength will last depending on how much basically you

342
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,600
invested in building it up, how much you strengthen that habit of an wholesome time.

343
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,200
And once you say no, it will be pulling you at the beginning harder, but then it will fade out more and more.

344
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,360
So you'd all you have to do is remain undeterred.

345
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,520
It is also, I mean, when the Buddha was dying,

346
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:44,480
and then an undeterred asks the Buddha, says, what should we do in regards to women? How should we?

347
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,320
And he says, don't look at them.

348
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah, don't look at them.

349
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,120
And then, yeah, what if we have to look at them?

350
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,720
Don't we speak with them?

351
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,200
Why don't you speak with them?

352
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,640
Because then we kind of 45 minds and be mindful.

353
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:09,280
But then what I was interested in is your being mindful, but it seems to me at different stages.

354
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,560
Because why would you want to be mindful if you can avoid it in the first place?

355
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,360
Like why would you want to have to be mindful in regards to it when dealing,

356
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,880
because basically we have to be mindful because that's the way to build with it.

357
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,680
But why would you wait for that long in order to have to deal with it when you can prevent

358
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,600
you from arising in the first place?

359
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,760
Don't look at it. Don't speak with it.

360
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,560
Then be mindful if you have to do it.

361
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,960
And that was like, basically in regards to that question,

362
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,000
was asked women in a sense of sensuality, for men,

363
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,440
are what should you do? Are you should deal with it?

364
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,480
Like, you'll discern, and it's not about testing yourself or seeing it now.

365
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,240
You see, you cut it into two, you don't engage at the level of sight.

366
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,400
You don't engage at the level of speaking.

367
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,560
If you can't avoid that, well, then you'll be mindful as the last resort in regards to that.

368
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,760
But what?

369
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,400
Because actually being able to prevent it, that's already implying mindfulness at proper time.

370
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,000
Having wisdom to discern it.

371
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
Ah, I can prevent this, cuts my work in half.

372
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:29,120
Because when a Buddha is saying, be mindful, he's not, he's talking about right mindfulness.

373
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,560
So it's also someone who knows what that is.

374
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,760
Yeah, exactly.

375
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,760
You've got to know, I can't do right mindfulness.

376
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,320
I don't have right to do, so I have to avoid these things for the time being.

377
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,560
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

378
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,240
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,520
Because that result of overcoming this thing, it's still not available.

380
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,160
So you want to basically kind of exclude it then as an option.

381
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:07,440
And it's in the Hindu tradition, you know, they do seven years of celibacy.

382
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,440
You know, you don't look at women, you don't speak to them.

383
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,480
You're nothing to do with it.

384
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:20,080
Just to maintain your celibate life, so you can build up this energy and attain some higher status and better.

385
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,280
Because it does, yeah, you have to go through that.

386
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,440
You have to hold back and not be around those things.

387
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,000
So you can actually have a bit of a firm grip on your mind.

388
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,040
Because by not engaging in those things on the level of sight, speech, touch, whatever else,

389
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,160
then your mind can, like, you can know.

390
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,440
Well, encompass it fully as a phenomenal sensuality, attraction, desire, and so on.

391
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,320
By not being engaged.

392
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,360
Because the moment you're engaged with it, well, then already mind is in it,

393
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,720
which means you can be seeing it from a different angle within that.

394
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,880
Which means you can then be possibly seeing correctly how it is to be outside of it.

395
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,000
So you need to actually be outside in order to recognize the view outside.

396
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,520
You can be inside and then you fantasize how it is to be outside, but that's not the same.

397
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:33,200
So, and again, the similar in the suit does is like being in the water, wet,

398
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,520
having two wet pieces of wood trying to light the fire, but I mean, to get in one work.

399
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,520
So you step outside on the shore, but then you have to wait until that wood dries out,

400
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:53,440
and then you can start the fire, like light the spark of wisdom and so on.

401
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,600
So yeah, you might have stopped engaging in sensuality, but then you have to

402
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,640
maintain that for a while until the mind dries out.

403
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,880
And then it can discern and see clearly what it is.

404
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:17,280
You go, you take the pieces of wood out out of the water,

405
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,760
but they're drying out, helps you to see more subtle things where you see, of course,

406
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,800
the origin of these things. It's basically like being wet means your mind is wet,

407
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,840
your thoughts are wet.

408
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,960
And that means it's sort of dampens. There can't be like a fire of wisdom,

409
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,360
energy of wisdom. It can arise because everything is wet, so give it.

410
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,400
So you need to stop making it wet and then you have to, by not making it wet,

411
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,720
you have to persevere in that until it dries out completely.

412
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,080
And then things will become more evident.

413
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,560
I think one of the things that become more evident, I would say, well,

414
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,000
is that sooner when the Buddha talks about giving attention to your masculine features,

415
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,400
to your masculinity, because I find myself if I become not thinking sensual thoughts,

416
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,160
I'm not even saying it as much as I can, you know, I don't do it.

417
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:37,040
But when I delight in my masculinity, they're implying that I can see it coming,

418
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,680
pushing it or giving it to, how do you say? Pressure really, like. Yeah, funny, you said that,

419
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:52,560
but I have the same, same, same wishes. But what I find, what I practice with is,

420
00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:00,800
if I do notice that, if I, then I can also either give attention to my masculine feature,

421
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,560
or I feel like powerful in my muscles, or whatever, or I don't, I don't have to do that.

422
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:14,960
I can feel strong, but I don't have to delight in that. But you need to be dry enough

423
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,560
to be able to see that as well, you know, you can't see that. But I think,

424
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,040
things have to be a bit dry, to see the subtlety. Yeah, but the dry you are,

425
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:32,160
as I said, the more things you begin to discern, more and more and more, things that you couldn't

426
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:40,560
have seen because it was a wet. You see where the enemy comes in? Yeah, and that's it. If you come

427
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,880
to that point, then all you have to do is never give attention to masculine signs, which means

428
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,080
they will never be an opening for the attraction in regard to the opposite to a rise.

429
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:56,560
But it doesn't mean that you become non-masking. No, not at all.

430
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,720
Because in fact, it's what we just spoke about, things, you become very strong.

431
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,720
But it's also not a vanity strength, a rise strength, a strength very based on the physical

432
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,120
appearance of whatever else, is a strength of the mind, which is a different, very different thing.

433
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:21,280
Yeah, but yeah, it's a valid strength. Well, it's the real strength.

434
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,560
To be honest about why, exactly, the person in my mind doesn't do that.

435
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:45,920
So, as you said, I'm in the best physical condition I've been in years.

436
00:48:45,920 --> 00:49:04,720
Like, oh, such a waste. Yeah. Yeah, I'm in my prime with something like that.

437
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:33,200
Yeah, at times I find myself laughing, like, I'm funny, like, the different ways that the mind

438
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,000
approaches the same thing to get it done, like, when it comes to the environment. Yeah.

439
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:56,880
That's different approaches. And, like, at times when I notice, I'm not complex by how, how,

440
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:09,520
well, while the cunning, you know, the way the mind approaches the same department, it's just, you know, it's

441
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,640
really laughable. Yeah, well, that's exactly how I'm out of work, really.

442
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:25,760
And all you have to do is just ignore it. Just don't, don't give a full attention to it.

443
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,440
And, yeah, you'll follow it's course. And if you take you with it,

444
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:46,400
just turn a blind eye here and there. That's it. Ignore. Ignore it. Ignore it.

445
00:50:46,400 --> 00:51:01,840
Tiredness is sitting in his inventory. It is, yeah. And his heavy rain is not making it easier. Yeah.

446
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:08,240
I'm sort of feeling that, you know, I start feeling like, oh, I feel like all that happened.

447
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:17,680
Yeah. But then again. I really say it's one of the ways I'm trying to wipe it. Yeah.

448
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,720
I wore the chopsticks. I wasn't sure. I don't know. It's just a guard.

449
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:34,720
Well, I was having difficulty as well as when you're watching your mind so closely to see, you know,

450
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:43,040
whatever you're doing is awesome. You don't want to do that. When it's like, what happens

451
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:49,120
just you feel, you don't want to, you just want to avoid things. You want to go to sleep rather.

452
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,960
Well, yeah, yeah, that's why the sloth and talk will become a hindrance.

453
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,680
And you see, you see actually how much you don't need sleep. Yeah.

454
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:07,840
Yeah. You can just keep very little. And the rest of the time it's just I want to just ignore.

455
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,680
I don't want to actually watch my thoughts. I don't want to look at things. That's quite painful.

456
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,920
Well, it can be. It's heavy. Ways in the industry. Yeah. Yeah. The pool.

457
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,320
But again, the thing is with every hindrance, it's actually rooted in the body.

458
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:35,680
Yeah. So the body does need sleep. The body does get sleepy. The body does get agitated.

459
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,560
The body does get excited. You know, any sensuality experience is completely confined to the body

460
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:49,680
and bodily senses. So you can, by discerning fully, the extent of, of, uh,

461
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:57,600
nivarana, the, uh, the hindrance is fully bound with the body. You can actually, you're

462
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,640
surmounted like that. You can never spill over. You can never be anything more than bodily.

463
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,120
So what you have to do is not give into your body and you're going to give into an hindrance.

464
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,000
Well, even the doubt, the doubt, like it's the, the form of the doubt, when you are actually

465
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
affected by the doubt, it's, it's felt. You experience it in your body.

466
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,120
Like when the doubt takes over you, when you're panicking on a kind of doubt.

467
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,520
Like I'm doing a lingua. Yeah.

468
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,000
So black side is for this. Yeah. Exactly.

469
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:48,400
It is a, that's the, the two ways. And also it doesn't, I'm not saying that the five images are

470
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,880
physical in terms of their found in your body, like whatever else. I mean, they put

471
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,680
the same to your body. That's what I like. Yeah. It means they put the same to your body,

472
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,520
the body, the bound with the body. They cannot be experienced without the body.

473
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:09,920
Yeah. But you're saying then, when this, when you recognize one of the five images,

474
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:18,640
you should recognize it as arising while the body is there, like you recognize it while the

475
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,320
body is there. That's what it means bound with the body. It means to the extent the body is there.

476
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,480
So you can't be found elsewhere independently of it.

477
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:35,040
Yeah. So the domain, the domain of the five images is always there in regard to the body.

478
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:42,720
Basically means the domain is, is maintained through the, if you're not free from possibility

479
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:49,920
of accepting any of the hindrance that arises on account of body. And when you accept it,

480
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:57,040
when you give into it, when you're affected by it, all of that, that's when it's a hindrance.

481
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,080
If your mind becomes stronger, literally just stronger than the hindrance. So it doesn't mean

482
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:14,640
that you never experience sleepiness or like the body never gets excited. No. But the mind is always

483
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:20,560
on every occasion stronger than any of those things. That means you're not taken by, you cannot be

484
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:28,960
taken up by any hindrance anymore. But let me work in mind, you're seeing it in the right view,

485
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,240
with the right view. Yeah, the right view will take you there and then it's just the development.

486
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:54,000
You can see the hindrance. So you can be mindful of your thoughts. But you also have to be able to see it

487
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,960
like the same rising with the body. Yeah, you also have to be strong enough to endure the body

488
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:08,320
basically, with its pulse. But then means you have to have the right view, like the right view.

489
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,360
Well, yes, but also like, if you don't have the right view, it can certainly enable you to have it.

490
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,400
Well, it's along the right line. So if you don't have the right view, you'll certainly develop one

491
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:32,720
if you practice like this. So how are we apart there? To turn to your body.

492
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:42,000
Angle. Well, let's see, you could, you could, it pretends to your body internally and pretends

493
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,440
to the body just externally or just to the body. But as long as a body is there, it will pretend to

494
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:54,160
do it. Because can you be angry with some, with any person without the image of their body, their

495
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:04,960
appearance, their face, their tokens, their signs, anything physical, inconceivable, inconceivable.

496
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,360
Even if you say, well, I don't hate, like, I'm not talking about hating the physical aspects.

497
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,960
If you hate what somebody said, you can hate them on account. They said, when you have that

498
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:23,120
phenomenon of hate present, you have simultaneously that phenomenon is bound with the presence of

499
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:31,360
their bodily image that you have encountered, the face or the entire, whatever. It will be

500
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:39,600
pertaining to the bodily aspect, which is not accidental then, that giving into hate will result in you

501
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:46,400
attacking the physical aspect, whether through verbal abuse, if you have even less respect to

502
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,720
physical abuse. So annihilation, destruction of their physical aspect is the satisfaction of your

503
00:57:52,720 --> 00:58:00,160
anger. Same body desire, sexual desire, sexual desire, inseparable from bodily.

504
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:11,840
Just inconceivable. You can't have it. You either have to have an image of your bodily present

505
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,680
in a form of giving into the notion of your own masculine, or you have to put up there the

506
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:30,640
image of the external body's presence or both.

507
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:49,040
Oh, the wind. Nice.

508
00:58:49,040 --> 00:59:01,920
What I just also noticed before I left, I looked at Kindle, looking to see if there's a suit on

509
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:09,280
watching two types of thoughts, so by discerning wholesome thoughts and wholesome thoughts,

510
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:17,840
eventually Eoi enters the first time and so on. But also by discerning the five hindrances,

511
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,480
then the entrance is first done. It's the same. It's the same person.

512
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:34,960
His five hindrances are basically five ways the unwholesome thought can manifest itself.

513
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:43,520
And over a path in them, it can be unwholesome. So by recognizing the domain of the five hindrances,

514
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:51,200
you sort of overcome the domain of unwholesome manifestation.

515
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:01,360
It's what I like is it's just a simple thing. It's a very simple thing.

516
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:13,040
Depending on how far you pursue it, how clearly you discern it, that will determine how far you get.

517
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:25,120
But it is a pressure line, because it's like climbing up, high up on the hill,

518
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:33,120
how you get them all pressure it gets harder and whatever else, but then there's the world for the

519
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:40,800
eventually. Because there's always the possibility of pleasure.

520
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:52,080
But going back to the pleasure that you know, but if you keep going, there will be a point of no return.

521
01:00:52,080 --> 01:01:00,900
When you know, ah, you will not return, it's impossible for you to return to the pleasure

522
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,900
that you know.

523
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:07,660
And then as the super say, like the stone that has been split in half, you can never

524
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:14,340
ever make it one again, or like a dry leaf that came off the tree, it can never be green

525
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,340
again.

526
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:25,900
Oh, even like, you know, slightly more vivid examples of like, food you vomit it out,

527
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:48,220
it can not desire anything.
