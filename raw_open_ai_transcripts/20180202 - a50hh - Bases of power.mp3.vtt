00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
So, that's what I was going to ask, what do you think about the empires, the basis for

00:09.000 --> 00:17.000
potency, the kitchen of your environment, as potency, people join their powers, or basis

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
of spiritual powers?

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
It's really concerned, well, it seems to be initially concerned with who's getting spiritual

00:28.000 --> 00:43.000
powers. It's strange to me to be talking about that, but what it is is desire, energy,

00:43.000 --> 00:59.000
tension is on, and amongst these four bases which have plus the determinations of striving,

00:59.000 --> 01:09.000
which is the four right efforts, and the composure days based on that will attain this composure

01:09.000 --> 01:19.000
to that composure. You can build mastery of the body, you have these spiritual powers, you

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
can fly, whatever. And then it says, you know, it gets rid of all the tanks coming home.

01:29.000 --> 01:39.000
Do you understand that, because you know, this is not an analysis, so these four bases of

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
potency may develop and cultivate and upgrade fruit benefits.

01:45.000 --> 01:54.000
A big big advantage for basis for spiritual power, that's a basis for potency. It's

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
because there is a spiritual spiritual power, you know, that for this is composure due to

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
desire and determinations of striving. Thus my, many things, thus my desire will neither

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
be too slack nor too tense, and it will be neither constricted internally nor distracted

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
externally, nor dwells perceiving, after and before, as before, so after, as after, so

02:25.000 --> 02:35.000
before, as below, so above, as above, so below, as day, as by day, so at night, so as night,

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
so by day. But as you can, as you can see from there, basically it's like the ultimate

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
clear perspective. That is, then the mind is composed upon.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Well, as you said, this is just one last thing, you know, many of the first cross ones

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
that we said, that's because the mind is open and envelopes, the develops, the mind

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
gives them luminously. Right. That's it. So basically, I mean, the

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
approach that is dealing with others, but obviously the Iran is the same, the same thing

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
of, of like an establishment of mind on a certain clarity that depends on a certain

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
generality of that mindfulness in their level. Each, as if for some people establishing

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
the mind in such manner would also result as other sort of say, if there is an opening

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
like in the service translation, what is often gained in these powers?

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Or hypotheses. But they are basically gained on the foundations of that clear

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
perspective that's actually the foundation of wisdom. So if somebody develops

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
wisdom in their right manner, plus has these openings, they'll get these special

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
powers. Or if somebody aims at a special powers through gaining wisdom, well,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
you'll have to go through developing that wisdom and knowledge based on the clear

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
perspective. And then the powers will be seconded, it really.

04:05.000 --> 04:14.000
This whole thing is about, no argument, just the keen earnestness,

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
earnest, putting forth an age you too, I understand.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, because you've got to go out the mind. Yeah, because you have one goal,

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
one thing going to the goal. And actually, people use this suit as this

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Buddhist teaching as a way to succeed in anything new.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh, right. It's right over there.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
The power for base to success. Right.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
The beginning of what it is. Yeah, of course.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
You need that same. Well, perspective and wisdom will help you with whatever

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
that. Obviously, it's not. It's not the end of it.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
Because it's clearly talked about the terminations of striving in terms of

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
getting rid of an awesome quality for identity. With that,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
you say, with that is coupled with that desire, coupled with that investigation

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
energy in the result. No, definitely.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
The determination of striving was simply basically the energy.

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
It's the main factor of very much among the main factors.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
Because it's at that constant, underlanting effort to the minds

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
putting in. That's basically how the world gets done.

05:40.000 --> 05:49.000
I think I told you that before, if there is a closest to a method of practicing

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
the download, that would be the method of just not pressing

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
mentally as in possibly striving mentally to understand.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Not striving blindly to some mechanical sort of repetition of some

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
motions, but striving mentally to clear out the mind from my

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
wholesome states, whether you're sitting, walking, standing or laying

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
down, whether you're going in the mud, tripping the leaves,

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
walking, because it basically, no matter what you're doing, externally,

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
internally, the mind maintains the same proportion, the same attitude,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
which is not bothered at anything of wholesome, and understand the

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
wholesome, basically.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Whereas the one who said, like the monk, like one, he's keen,

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
he doesn't leave anything out. He doesn't leave anything unturned.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
So he does everything and investigates the meaning, everything until he gets

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
a clarity. Like the other source has dealt with a knife, like

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
cutting and getting in further and further and further, until things become

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
very, very clear. Or the other source, the butcher, skilled butcher,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
cutting up a cow. And in the beginning, you just see this mountain

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
mass, sort of, of organs and stuff, but the skilled butcher is

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
capable of cutting it all out. And as he's cutting it bit by bit, he's

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
understanding what does phenomena. Now, that needs to be qualified.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
It's understood in that mindful, phenomenological way, not in an

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
analytic way, as in you divide into 16 conformance and memorize them

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
and suddenly think that's not understanding. That's just collecting

07:27.000 --> 07:36.000
information. So in the proper sense, you basically keep pushing

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
things until the clarity is reached.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
There's always having to go in mind.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Well, there's one goal in mind, basically.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Three of the top rankings.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
If he ain't known, it's going to be striving in this way

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
without the government. Well, of course, yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So you have to understand what you have to get some degree of

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
understanding, as I said, so to say again, you hear the teaching and

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
you measure the task, basically means you get the idea of what

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
needs to be done. And that's how you're around the energy

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
you're doing it. That's why people can't.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
They're very keen, very inspired, but they can't get the energy

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
because they don't really know what it's supposed to do.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
They're attracted from one meditation technique to the other,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
from one teach to the other. But deep inside, they really don't know

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
for themselves what they're supposed to do.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And for as long as that's the case, they won't have the energy

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
to do it.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, you have to have something.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
It's going to be broken, you know, all the time.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
The chanting is going to be.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Well, can you show the ears, but you don't want to be defending

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
on that. You don't want to be defending on something

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
poking you. You want to be poking yourself.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And basically getting the energy going in that manner.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
As in, so like, taking up, becoming a monk.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
As in, well, sure. But no, I mean more particularly,

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
as in like, if you're sitting around, don't let your mind wander

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
thinking lazy thoughts, but pick up something you haven't understood,

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
something you think you're in this way, but just keep drilling.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
And then it'll pick itself up. The momentum will take over.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
But not before you invest in that sort of whining up.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
You're somebody who says, that's the urgency of ages.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
I think it's going to make him do the methods.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, I guess so.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, because it seems, because you can become complacent here

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
with, like, the government asked him,

09:55.000 --> 10:02.000
and he said, okay, I'm not happy with being a good enough monk.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
It's so easy, he's the guest.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
He's used to live a lot to do something.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
You're not exposed to anything.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Well, I mean, yeah, but that is just like,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
that's your undoing.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
Basically, because no matter how comfortable or agreeable

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
circumstances are, the fact is what you're still subject to death,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
illness, dissolution, and everything else.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
So you just have to be thinking about those things,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
and you will be coming out complacency soon enough.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
But it's that lazy attitude, mental laziness, indulgence,

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
complacency that prevents you or other takes away from thinking

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
those thoughts, and then you don't even.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
And the further away you go, the harder it becomes to think those thoughts,

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
because then you have to make more effort to think that.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
If I may, this segue is nicely into one of my questions.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
This could dimensions.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I was ethereal being too strained versus too lax.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
The other sit, I always remember about it,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
is like the one we're in, but it's talking to some musician.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
He said, as you can, there are strings too tight for the loose.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
So I guess the question is, like, if you can just speak more about,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
maybe, practical, so to say, you know,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
finding the middle between, like, you know,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
putting forth so much energy that it becomes, like, restless,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
and kind of, like, a little nutty versus, like, saying,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
oh, you know, as you say, often you have to keep drilling,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
and then you can fall into the blaze, like, oh, you know,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
you just have to kind of wait around for it,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
which is falling into that complacent.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
Well, the thing is, yeah, especially in the beginning,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
you might be getting restless and so on,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
but even nutty, but it's not only the world,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
even if you do, as long as you're starting

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
and doing it for the right reasons,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and along with our lines, as in,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
you're really trying to understand the sort of,

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
in that case, sort of picking up some metals

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
and becoming a robot or something,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
and then get completely obsessed with that.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
So it has to be, that's what I say,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
so the method, so you can't just keep repeating it,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
you can't do it the same every day,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
because different things arise in your experience,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
which means you need to look at them differently,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
you need to, so that, which is in common to your efforts,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
is that desire to understand,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
desire to reach a clarity of the phenomena,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
or the feeling, intention, perception,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
basically suffering, freedom from it,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
the form of the truth, whatever you want to call it.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
It's the same insight, so,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
if you're doing it rightly,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
you would see that basically,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
you can't do too much of it,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
as in, you might get tired,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
so you can't keep actively making effort to understand,

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
but the state of not making the effort mentally,

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
does not need to lead to the state of being

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
relaxed and complacent either.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
So yeah, you don't have to be actively pursuing,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
but you can remain mindful,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
and you can't have too much of that mindfulness.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
It's basically the other,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
it's when people don't see everyone, that's the problem,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
it's not that they make too much effort,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
it's when they stop making the effort,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
they don't stay on that mindfulness, which is neutral,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
then they go completely the opposite way.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Oh, I made the effort, now I get too relaxed,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
because of the effort they made.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
So, you need to find,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
you need to learn how to,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
how to rest,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
because it is a restful place in that mindfulness,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
not in the distraction,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
not in the senses,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
not in the sensuality,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
which is usually what people use

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
for the restful place of their mind.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Well, I've been working hard,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
now I'm gonna put my feet up,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and really, you know,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
have a drink and just relax,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
or go out with a friend,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
or do something,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
and that's what it relaxes people,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
the sensuality,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
but actually that's not relaxing at all.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
But, for the mind who has that

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
as a starting point,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
it will take some effort

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
into relearning what's true,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
a relaxation is which is basically mindfulness,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
the practice of mindfulness,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
which is nothing other than samadhi.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
So, when you're not actually pursuing

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
the understanding of the meaning,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
but you remain on that basis

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
upon which the understanding of the meaning occurs.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
So, that's why even if you're not actually pursuing it,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
the development of that basis,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
so that samadhi,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
will bring the clarity eventually,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
and a slow rate of still.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah, the composure, yes.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Good, but the rest in touch are mindfulness screening.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, exactly.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Because that's the thing,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
like, it can make too much effort,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
too little effort, doesn't matter.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
There will vary on your end of the day

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
what you have to do,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
but there is no excuse for being mindful.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Actually, there is no excuse for that.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
So, there is no excuse

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
for allowing your mind to rest

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
on unholesome things,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
because not resting on unholesome things,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
it's not actually touched them at all.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
But it states that it's the assumption of sensuality

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
that it requires us to,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
well, that sort of makes us,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
or maintains the belief that,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
resting means when you get the pleasure

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
of the senses or distraction.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
But it's not.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
But that they stand to unlearn.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
To relate it to a summary,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
you've used this word with, like,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
you know, when you're mindful,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
and there's nothing particularly on the whole sum,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
it's like watching cows in a field,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
like a chase absolutely,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
to see if they're there, just doing their thing.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
But people perhaps say,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't know if I don't look at the cows at all,

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
and they're off my mind,

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
they don't have to worry,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
but then anything can happen.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Well, exactly.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah, yeah.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
So, you don't want to be

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
counting and strangling a cow

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
in terms of trying to control it,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
nor do you want to be looking completely elsewhere

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
where you don't even see a cow.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
So then that's the whole point of mindfulness,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
giving that perspective

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
where you can see it,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
without actually having to chase it,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
or hold it down.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And yeah, no matter how tired you are,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
physically or mentally,

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
mindfulness is never cause of that tiredness,

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
nor can I be an impediment to rest.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
You could basically say,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
you remind a lot of I'm tired.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Absolutely.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
And that's already quite a wholesome way

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
of resting.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
So if you're established

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
of a mindfulness correctly,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
you can never kind of veer off too much

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
of the right track.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
You can't forget.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Well, you can't.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You can't get too warmed up

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
and restless,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
nor can you get too careless in central.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
This is,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
when you've got this,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
there's already

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
any explanation,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
and how big is does it be cool,

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
as well,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
receiving after and before,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
before and after,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
as not as after and before?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah, because the perception

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
of after and before is well brought

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
by a big alternative,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
well considered,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
penetrating by wisdom.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Just in that one.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
And that's it.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Okay.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
So?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Before and after.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
What?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Well,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
do you have anything specifically

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
before and after?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Who told you some sound?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Well, no, no.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Did you do that?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
No, no.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Just before a phenomenon

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
before and after.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Before this and after this,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
past and future,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
up and down,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
above or below.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Basically, the point is

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
getting the perspective

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
and your experience as a whole.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Now, just what's here now,

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
and what has been,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
if you think about past,

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
what will be,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
if you think about the future,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
that's all already present

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
in the present.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
So, as before,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
after this is what he clearly understood,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
as after so and before.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And that's where he goes to be

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
thinking about contemplating,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
because if you're looking

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
to clear the self-management,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
please,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
you see what has happened

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
before.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
And you can see the possibilities.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Well, I'm just sure,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
but it's not the particular,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
you don't pick up particular things

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
of your past,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
and then you think about it

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
and learn from it,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
and introduce some sort of information

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
that can help you.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
And yet, that's fine.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
But this refers to

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
the actual framework

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
called before,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
a framework of after.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
On a very general level

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
of that perspective,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
that's why it's listed there

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
with those things.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Not like with things

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
just remember what you've done,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
remember what you might do.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Before and after.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
For as long as there is now,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
there will be before.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
So as long as there is now,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
there will be after.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
It's not like

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
that they're all free

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
at the same time.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
It's not like before,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
now and after.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Why is this coming?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Why is it?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Well,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
because all the assumptions

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
they are assumed in the past,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
because all the other habits,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
they're not existing

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
for the future,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
they're presently present.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
That's why.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Because they're like,

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
when other hand becomes

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
another hand,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
even when he thinks of himself,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
at the time he was put to dinner,

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
even that,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
he's not his self anymore.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
He doesn't even take

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
the past self as his self.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Why?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Because he has presently understood

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
the nature of self

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
as truly not self.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Okay.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
So he's taking this phenomenon

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
and living in it.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Yeah.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
So anything before,

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
anything before,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
just a framework of before.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
So a framework of after.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
There's after,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
so before,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
basically,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
you apply that perspective,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
that perspective,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
that perspective,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
in all directions,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
so to speak.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Now just right here,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm not what I'm seeing,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
what I'm hearing,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
what I'm mindful of,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
but any thoughts of past,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
any thoughts of the future,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
everything becomes included

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
in that perspective.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Clearly.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
No, okay.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Could you have,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
obviously,

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
have that thought of yourself?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
You will.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
They always,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
always,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
always in the future.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Every point of view,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
as Annabella said,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
has, like,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
either under-determined

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
or over-determined

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
aspect to it,

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
which means,

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
depending on how you're looking,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
you're only looking to,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
like,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
either seeing your past

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
represent,

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
or you're looking

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
in the future through your present.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And that's all present.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Doing something now,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
with this,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
future in mind.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Yeah.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Or you have some thoughts

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
with you now,

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
which, basically,

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
are kind of lingering

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
from something

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
there was before.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
That is also present,

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
as before,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
now.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And explain to the other,

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
think,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
PROJECCDULORN

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
as a big draw,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
as below,

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
is a little further about the

21:31.000 --> 21:31.000
figure that is completely

21:31.000 --> 21:43.000
your experience of the body depends. So you can take one part, you'll have to take 32, but if you would take all the parts that were there that can be taken, you'll have 32.

21:43.000 --> 21:51.000
So the body is the body as a whole, the experience of the body as a whole. You don't leave anything out or down left or right.

21:51.000 --> 21:59.000
You don't leave anything out to bring out that body, everything is dependent upon that body, which is included by including that body.

21:59.000 --> 22:06.000
So it dwells, it dwells. Yeah, it dwells not resting upon anything, not picking up anything, not assuming anything, not taking up anything.

22:06.000 --> 22:17.000
Interns spatially, and in terms of temporally, before or after, tens of time, and in terms of space above or below in regard to this, before or after in regard to this.

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
So the same thing really just pertains to two different phenomena, but the same as it should. Not as it can be this one.

22:24.000 --> 22:43.000
As it by day is so at night, so it's night so by day, it develops the basis forms, you know, the prosceness is composure due to desire and termination of striving, by way of the same qualities, the same features, the same as this, as it develops that basis form.

22:43.000 --> 22:50.000
You can see by day, it does not exist. Yeah, no difference. It doesn't really strive.

22:50.000 --> 23:03.000
And then, with the mind, it's open and uninvolved. Developed the mind and used the monocity. Here we use the perception of light as well, to ask.

23:03.000 --> 23:15.000
Luminosity, which basically should be to say there's a non-indicative. I, not pointing at anything, not resting at anything, luminous all around.

23:15.000 --> 23:26.000
It means basically not picking up anything in any direction. So I'm going back to it. I'm just saying that you can't use the word luminous, but you have to determine what it is, in what sense it's luminous.

23:26.000 --> 23:43.000
It's in a sense, it's a non-indicative thing. Because if you're just to be luminous all around, you think of consciousness being this bright light that shines, and that you're entering this extra plane of permanent light and beauty, or something like that is up.

23:43.000 --> 23:56.000
It really doesn't indicate anything anywhere, before or after, up or down, as a resting point, as a sense of self, as something you will lean on.

23:56.000 --> 24:05.000
Hence that infinity of that structure shines everywhere and nowhere, so to speak.

24:05.000 --> 24:13.000
So here we use the perception of light as well, across the perception of days, while we're solved.

24:13.000 --> 24:21.000
So it is in this way, because it's bigger with the mind, it's open, and it's empty, mind can use it.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
Correct, I get that. Do you know the phenomenon of light?

24:26.000 --> 24:36.000
Well, the phenomenon of light is negative in regards to everything that you see, when the light is present. You can't see anything, there's no light.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
But what you're seeing is not light, it's the objects, or in more particular things revealed by their light.

24:42.000 --> 24:54.000
So again, it's the same principle of a more general phenomenon upon which you start to remind, because of which you then transcend the particular phenomenon that depends directly upon it.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
Everything you see depends upon light being there.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
You know darkness.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
Well, in a sense, yeah, the absence of light.

25:05.000 --> 25:19.000
So you resolve upon perception of day, or perception of light, and then your mind can develop, get established upon that perception.

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
And at the standard for you provide you basically freedom from the pool of any particular things that you'd be seeing.

25:26.000 --> 25:34.000
So you're viewing these thoughts, particular parts, and present thoughts.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
You're reviewing them presently.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
You're going to end the body, but you're striving.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Any night. The same.

25:43.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, just maintaining the same attitude, regardless of what you're doing, obviously depending on what you're doing means you will have more.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
You will be able to invest more or less effort in it.

25:56.000 --> 26:06.000
But even if you're doing something that requires most of all of your attention, in that sense, you still want to compromise the mindfulness.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
And restraint, which is really kind of luminosity.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
Well, yeah, like on the basis of that mindfulness, your mind can get established upon luminosity.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
But upon all sorts of other different establishments, they will kind of provide you with the same results.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
Three of the only studies is just for different people, we work differently.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
I, different people can establish upon different things more successfully.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
But it's the same principle of the same establishment.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
It's the same as seen as in some.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
The other says it's all the different meditations.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
It might just be breathing.

26:42.000 --> 26:49.000
The different things is, I would say, different exercises in regards to the same principle.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Oh, absolutely.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
And also, it's not like, for example, as it says, like the casinos, the ten casinos for example.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's not like ten casinos.

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
One establishment of mind upon the casino, or one casino for all the establishments.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
But then within that, you can take that same establishment, same principle, further and further and further.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
Ten times, like the ten refinements to the same principle, so they're ten casinos.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
It's not like they're laid out one, so you go from one, then you do the next one, then you do.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
No, it's basically doing the same further and further and further.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
We'll take you from the casino verse to the most refined casino consciousness.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
But it's the same principle, which means you don't need all ten.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
You just need one.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
And you'll have all ten in a way.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
And the same, same.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
For every genre is the same.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Whenever in the suit, there's always a beyond this.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It's like developing the same.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
How far you can go.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
So the practice of genres, the casinos, the establishment of different perceptions.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
It's always the same principle.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Now, principle.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
It's a principle.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
It's alternate.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Well, yeah.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah, I mean, you can.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
The principle is where the principle could be some further.

28:08.000 --> 28:23.000
Better.
