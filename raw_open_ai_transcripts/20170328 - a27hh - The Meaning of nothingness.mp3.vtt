00:00.000 --> 00:22.880
To me, there's always this gap between self and others, other things, it can never

00:22.880 --> 00:31.040
be filled, but you can never get to anything, that self can never hurt anything. There's always this

00:31.040 --> 00:40.640
abyss that can never be crossed, if you know what I mean. Yeah, oh no, thisness, yeah, never

00:40.640 --> 00:54.160
able to get anything, no matter how intense you want it. Well, that gap is the result of you assuming

00:54.160 --> 00:59.360
the sense of self, which obviously automatically means assuming the self of others, or rather

01:00.560 --> 01:06.240
assuming self internally, assuming self externally. So for as long as that assumption is given the

01:06.240 --> 01:12.800
priority, as long as it's the center of your acts and thinking, they will be a gap generated as a result of it.

01:14.240 --> 01:20.080
You see, and then that's how things are, so it's a mistake, so to speak, but it's a

01:20.080 --> 01:25.520
beginning-less mistake. So then the gap is real, and the sense of self is real, and the sense of

01:25.520 --> 01:32.080
others is also real. So you just have to reverse it. Instead of me trying to fill this gap, trying to

01:32.080 --> 01:40.160
possess this gap, trying to acquire things and others or whatever else, you realize that the whole

01:40.160 --> 01:46.480
picture is upside down, so it's actually you are the result. You're sent to self-sense about this

01:46.480 --> 01:57.920
if the result or the gap that's impossible to own. So it's not me reaching out to possess the gap,

01:57.920 --> 02:07.120
to fill the gap. It's basically gap defining me as well as that being that's in lack, that's

02:07.120 --> 02:13.360
lacking, that's in the need, and so on. So when you recognize that actually you are secondary,

02:13.360 --> 02:18.800
your sense of self is secondary to the gap, and you start seeing gap as a phenomenon, then you

02:18.800 --> 02:23.440
will start reaching for it less and less, because you recognize actually reaching is the result of

02:23.440 --> 02:29.040
the gap, not that reaching is the beginning when you kind of try to get the gap and fill it.

02:31.120 --> 02:37.360
Because you feel the need to fill because the gap is there. So if you appropriate the gap,

02:37.360 --> 02:43.040
you appropriate the need to fill. For if you appropriate the possibility of that gap being filled

02:43.040 --> 02:47.920
through your assumption, you will then crave to fill the gap. But none of that will possible if

02:47.920 --> 02:54.160
the gap hasn't risen there beforehand on its own, manifest it, a reason to you. So if you recognize

02:54.160 --> 03:00.080
that this need to fill it, it's because it has a reason as such. It's not yours, it's not you

03:00.080 --> 03:05.600
filling it, or trying you trying to fill, or that it needs to be there. The gap arises as a gap.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.920
So then the need to fill doesn't belong to anybody, and then you stop filling it.

03:09.920 --> 03:18.320
This is the need for oneness, or the idea that oneness. That's only the result of the separation.

03:20.320 --> 03:26.480
Unity applies separation, and as much as separation applies the possibility of unity,

03:26.480 --> 03:30.400
but abandoning both means none of it is applicable anymore.

03:34.320 --> 03:39.840
Because people would think that unity, but that's only because they maintain

03:39.840 --> 03:49.600
the idea of separation through craving for unity. You have to abandoning both. You have to see

03:49.600 --> 03:55.600
that whether it's separating or united, or both separate united, neither separate nor united,

03:55.600 --> 03:59.200
it's rather earned, and it's determined by the presence of the gap beforehand,

04:01.680 --> 04:08.720
presence of the senses beforehand. So you can't stop that. You can't stop that when I say

04:08.720 --> 04:13.760
before, and I mean structurally before, not temporarily, before, temporarily before.

04:14.560 --> 04:19.040
So things arise on the wrong, the manifest, including your thoughts, and then always you

04:19.040 --> 04:25.040
appropriate them, you assume that the ownership in hindsight, in retrospect, you say,

04:25.040 --> 04:30.640
well, that was mine, but the fact that things arise on the wrong means you're not their creator,

04:30.640 --> 04:35.760
their eyes to you, you might feel that they are rising for you, and so on, but all of

04:35.760 --> 04:45.120
the very secondary to their arising. So if it seemed like that, then the whole idea of

04:46.320 --> 04:53.920
unity, separation, feeling again, craving for it, impossible to insatiable, you can't satisfy

04:53.920 --> 04:59.600
desires or whatever else, all that is the result of the things that have ordered your reason,

04:59.600 --> 05:05.120
and you appropriate them. So appropriate them means you fall under, will you become a victim?

05:05.120 --> 05:11.680
So speak of their inherent pressure, like the pressure of the senses, senses are like one that

05:11.680 --> 05:16.160
in most they want to go in feed, where they want to go in feed. You take them to videos, I mean,

05:16.160 --> 05:22.320
you are going there to feed, they are dragging you left and right, like crocodile, monkey,

05:24.720 --> 05:32.080
wild boar, all those similarities are for the senses. But they do that on their own, that's their

05:32.080 --> 05:39.600
business. It's just you interfering with, you are trying to own it, which means because they're

05:39.600 --> 05:45.600
stronger than you, they'll take you with them, if you're stronger than them, then you'll be in

05:45.600 --> 05:50.160
control of the senses, but the only way to be stronger than your senses is to let go them,

05:50.160 --> 05:55.760
to recognize what they are. Obviously that is possible to do only once you have restrained them,

05:55.760 --> 06:05.840
that's why sealer comes first. And then the whole idea of of of of of of feeling that gap,

06:05.840 --> 06:10.560
which is becoming inconceivable, because that gap was only the result of maintaining that mistake

06:10.560 --> 06:16.640
upon usher, that then in return would be feeding more of the desire for ownership, because it's

06:16.640 --> 06:25.360
obviously that you can't own, but you took the whole, like you took it, the entire situation is taken

06:25.360 --> 06:32.400
in an upside down manner, and that's and that is taken for granted. So no matter how much you

06:32.400 --> 06:37.040
kind of your experience shows you that you can't fill that gap, that you can't own things,

06:38.720 --> 06:43.440
you never really question that assumption, you just keep doing it, you just keep it each time,

06:43.440 --> 06:47.760
and you can't help it, and you even say here my desire can never be satisfied, but you can't help

06:47.760 --> 06:52.480
going after them, because the five, five senses are pulling me, and it's weak, but if you were to

06:52.480 --> 06:59.280
start using hold on, what if I've taken this completely the wrong way around, what if it's not

06:59.280 --> 07:04.640
supposed to be filled, and what if that whole idea of feeling this gap and this desire is the

07:04.640 --> 07:11.280
result of me trying to fill the gap and the desires. So you constantly trying will make you want to try,

07:11.280 --> 07:16.240
see it's a vicious circle, it just goes around, but the entire thing is entirely gratuitous,

07:16.240 --> 07:22.880
it's just there's nothing, because there could be a desire, if you look at marriage and relationships

07:22.880 --> 07:31.120
like that, the desire to be united with the other person, the love, so this constant craving,

07:31.120 --> 07:39.040
yeah, it's not a problem, the purest of the of the worldly, what anyone will love for that matter

07:39.040 --> 07:44.080
actually, it's just absolutely rooted in attachment, rooted in craving, rooted in that

07:44.080 --> 07:50.240
assumption of ownership, so yeah there is pure love and a pure love is pretty much craving,

07:52.960 --> 07:59.840
because once that's in play, that love that is designed to, for oneness, there is something

07:59.840 --> 08:05.520
constantly, yeah, and for as long as you take that assumption for granted, means you will keep

08:05.520 --> 08:11.040
trying, means you will never take all of the signs of your experience, they're showing you that

08:11.040 --> 08:15.840
you can't actually fill that gap, no, can you satisfy your desires, you will never take that

08:15.840 --> 08:22.800
as a sign, as an indication that actually hold on, maybe it's impossible, and even if you do,

08:22.800 --> 08:30.080
you don't take it on a deeper level whereby it will make you stop going after it, people can

08:30.080 --> 08:35.200
want to, on a shallow level, on a shallow mental level, they can realize, oh yes, sure, yeah, of course,

08:35.200 --> 08:39.760
I mean, the life is pointless and it's, and you can't really satisfy your desires,

08:39.760 --> 08:43.600
but they won't sink in, why? Because they don't make enough effort for it to sink in,

08:44.320 --> 08:50.720
and why? Because they don't develop their behavior beforehand, as in as in practice virtue,

08:50.720 --> 08:56.240
restraint and see like, then it will sink in, now it can't sink in because their behavior contradicts

08:56.240 --> 09:01.120
it, the behavior goes against it, so no matter how much mentally you might be reflecting about

09:02.320 --> 09:07.440
how the unsatisfying pursuit of desire is there, if your acts are still aimed at the pursuit

09:07.440 --> 09:11.280
of desire, it means like, whatever you're thinking won't be much significant, because there's

09:11.280 --> 09:16.560
no way to land, your actions are just swiping it all away, just pull immediately because they're

09:16.560 --> 09:23.040
still going full power after desires, so you actually have to stop that first, endure that initial

09:23.040 --> 09:28.240
pain, and then these reflections will be able to sink in and land on the proper ground,

09:28.960 --> 09:38.960
that you created through restraint,

09:38.960 --> 09:55.600
but that's the important thing to remember, the craving to, the desire to fill the gap is basically

09:55.600 --> 10:19.120
the result of the desire to fill the gap, because something can lack

10:19.120 --> 10:29.760
something else, only in regard to a different thing, if you know what I mean, so a gap is to be

10:29.760 --> 10:40.640
filled only in regard to like a filled gap, in itself an empty hole, a gap is a thing in itself,

10:40.640 --> 10:48.400
and there's no desire to be filled, but if you project the assumption of a full hole,

10:48.400 --> 10:54.880
filled hole, leveled hole, completed hole, then this will seem incomplete, and because you

10:54.880 --> 11:00.400
appropriated it, then you feel the pressure of that incompleteness, because you stick your hand

11:00.400 --> 11:06.160
in it, it wasn't yours, you just wanted, you just can't know how to not make it yours,

11:06.160 --> 11:11.360
so then you just become a victim of that pressure of fill it, fill that gap, satisfy the desire,

11:12.960 --> 11:19.440
but in themselves, as I said, I go this well before, and itch, physical itch that you want to scratch,

11:19.440 --> 11:25.360
in itself, it's just an itch, in comparison to the state that it's free of it,

11:26.320 --> 11:31.840
oh, you feel pressure of scratching it, because scratching it might make it stop,

11:31.840 --> 11:38.160
take, I'll bring it to an end, which is more pleasant, so then you follow more pleasure basically,

11:38.160 --> 11:46.240
ah, so having a non desire, having a satisfied desire, it's more pleasant than having a desire

11:46.240 --> 11:55.120
that is not satisfied, that is more unpleasant, and you will always pursue the satisfaction

11:55.120 --> 11:59.680
desire, no matter how futile it is, no matter how much you know that it's futile, you will pursue

11:59.680 --> 12:04.160
it for as long as you hold the assumption of the pleasure that you get through this eyes,

12:05.040 --> 12:10.960
means you always go after it, because it's not, it's based on emotional level, you pursue pleasure,

12:11.920 --> 12:17.760
so feeling a gap, you keep doing it, because you assume that doing it is more pleasant than not

12:17.760 --> 12:22.560
doing it, but you fail to see that through doing it, you maintain that discrepancy,

12:22.560 --> 12:30.080
because you keep projecting the discrepancy that's created by you wanting a pleasurable experience

12:30.080 --> 12:37.040
of a filled gap, as opposed to a gap that's not filled, a hole that it's hollow, that it's empty,

12:38.240 --> 12:42.720
but if you stop holding onto the assumption of a filled gap, then discrepancy won't be hurting you

12:42.720 --> 12:48.320
anymore, thus there is no more pressure of desire, because an empty hole, it's a thing in itself,

12:48.320 --> 12:55.600
a full hole, it's a thing in itself, a perception, yeah, and that's why that's why that's why

12:55.600 --> 13:01.440
it's like in the similarly of scratching the edge, again, you maintain the edge

13:01.440 --> 13:05.600
through constant scratching it, because through scratching it you prevent it from hitting it,

13:05.600 --> 13:10.080
you keep maintaining that discrepancy through your right to scratching, so then it will keep it

13:10.080 --> 13:14.320
ching, that's what I remember before, through pursuit of desire, you maintain desire,

13:14.320 --> 13:21.040
it's as simple as that, it tells us like perceptions in pursuit of perceptions,

13:21.840 --> 13:27.520
yeah, you perceive those are getting involved, the perception of a filled hole,

13:28.560 --> 13:34.800
of a complete desire, it's inciting, it's pleasant, as opposed to doing complete,

13:35.840 --> 13:39.040
and because you crave for pleasure, you go after that perception,

13:39.040 --> 13:45.600
you stop craving for pleasure, then yeah, that is a more agreeable perception, that is a more

13:45.600 --> 13:51.680
disagreeable perception, but none of them need to be appropriately because of that, and none of

13:51.680 --> 13:57.840
them will be appropriate if you sort of relinquish the idea of that sensual pleasure that you get

13:57.840 --> 14:04.080
through pursuit of such perceptions, that's why we said it's impossible to engage in sensuality

14:04.080 --> 14:11.840
without sensual perceptions, because some people were claiming saying, oh, you can, you know,

14:11.840 --> 14:16.880
you can be free from sensuality and still engage, I don't know, in an intercourse or various things,

14:16.880 --> 14:22.560
because there was loads of brownish anesthetics sort of claiming the ultimate nibbana yet,

14:22.560 --> 14:27.520
you know, having wives or whatever else, it was at least impossible, it's inconceivable to be able

14:27.520 --> 14:32.640
to engage in sensuality, in an act of sensuality, without having those sensual perceptions

14:32.640 --> 14:36.480
established before it, and as I said, the sensual perception are the distortion,

14:39.680 --> 14:43.120
they choose you as such as real, so that's what you have at the time.

14:49.200 --> 14:59.680
Here's a, this, a nature, a sub-pire, a sutra, one of six majima, in regard to the base of nothingness,

14:59.680 --> 15:08.720
there's three ways to attain the base of nothingness, okay? And so it goes, again, because an

15:08.720 --> 15:13.920
noble disciple considers us sensual pleasures here and now, and sensual pleasures in life,

15:13.920 --> 15:22.320
in life to come, sensual pleasures here and now, sensual perceptions here and now, sensual

15:22.320 --> 15:27.280
perceptions in life to come, material forms here and now, material forms in life to come,

15:27.280 --> 15:34.800
perception of forms here and now, perceptions of forms in life to come, perceptions of the impotervable

15:34.800 --> 15:43.440
and eger, all are perceptions, where these perceptions cease without remainder, that is peaceful,

15:43.440 --> 15:50.080
they sublime, namely the base of nothingness. When he practices, in this way, in freedom he

15:50.080 --> 15:56.240
abides thus, his mind acquires confidence in this base, once there is full confidence, he either

15:56.240 --> 16:00.160
taint at the base of nothingness, now or else he resolves upon it with wisdom.

16:00.800 --> 16:05.440
Yeah, the standard, you understand it, the rest is a kind of strange translation,

16:05.440 --> 16:11.200
on the dissolution of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness,

16:12.240 --> 16:17.200
that's not the dodgy translation, it may pass on to rebirth in the base of nothingness,

16:18.080 --> 16:21.840
this is the first way directed to the base of nothingness,

16:21.840 --> 16:31.120
first way that you can attain that base of nothingness, so where these perceptions cease without

16:31.120 --> 16:36.400
remainder, that is peaceful, that's the base of nothingness, so how do you,

16:37.600 --> 16:39.840
where is the, where is that base of nothingness?

16:40.720 --> 16:47.840
Well, perceptions are absent, but that's the thing, see, well, first thing I would point out

16:47.840 --> 16:52.800
in regard to this, see, when he comes to base of nothingness, in similar descriptions,

16:52.800 --> 16:57.600
people immediately assume, and that is thanks to the commentaries and contemporary Buddhism,

16:57.600 --> 17:03.360
people assume it's often meditative attain, it's some sort of blind-town space start state,

17:04.320 --> 17:09.120
but as you can adjust the little passage of that, it's quite clear that it's nothing to do

17:09.120 --> 17:15.120
with that, because he said, he resolves upon wisdom, upon that state, which means you actually

17:15.120 --> 17:24.240
understand it, you discern it, and that's not a meditative attainment, you know, in a conventional

17:24.240 --> 17:28.160
sense of that word, it is, you can call that meditation, but that would be the right meditation,

17:28.160 --> 17:32.400
and also another thing I would point out, the paragraph starts with the normal disciple,

17:32.400 --> 17:38.240
with the right view has to be there, and if the right view is there, even such, again, in

17:38.240 --> 17:43.040
vertical matters, meditative attainments are actually evolving on the right view and wisdom,

17:43.040 --> 17:48.800
because that's what meditation is, cultivation of the right view that you already have beforehand,

17:50.240 --> 17:55.520
so at this particular instance, in terms of the not, well, you can, you don't have to go as far

17:55.520 --> 18:00.160
as the imputable perceptions, the point is, you recognize the nature of perceptions, so that's

18:00.160 --> 18:06.720
where it starts, all the essential, the causes, essential perceptions, here, in the future lives,

18:06.720 --> 18:12.880
then they're the form, the perceptions of form, here, in the future lives, then even the most

18:12.880 --> 18:20.080
peaceful perceptions, imputable, regardless of the diversity of the form, the perceptions of

18:20.080 --> 18:26.160
the imputable, means basically what you discern through the nature of perception, because that's it,

18:26.160 --> 18:31.120
what's in common to essential perceptions, the perceptions of form, to the imputable perceptions,

18:31.120 --> 18:38.960
as it says, they're all perceptions, they all share the nature of perception, as an aggregate,

18:38.960 --> 18:43.760
and which means that discernment can be established on their level, perception is there,

18:45.200 --> 18:50.560
you don't care what perception, you don't care if it's diversified or unified, you don't care if

18:50.560 --> 18:57.280
it's imputable or not, perceptions, the mind is established upon that, and then, through the discernment

18:57.280 --> 19:02.560
of the nature of perception, you can see, okay, it has a reason, even that sublime, refined,

19:02.560 --> 19:08.400
imputable nature of perception, regardless of the particular manifestations of that perception,

19:08.400 --> 19:15.520
that perception has a reason, as such, it sees without a reminder, when the time comes, and there

19:15.520 --> 19:21.840
is nothing, so that nothingness can, it's sort of perceived in an indirect manner, you can't perceive

19:21.840 --> 19:27.760
nothingness directly, but you can certainly establish your mind in regard to it in an indirect manner

19:27.760 --> 19:34.000
by surmounting the sphere of perception, and that's done through understanding, through, like,

19:34.000 --> 19:40.160
through real, correct, phenomenology, knowledge of phenomena, knowledge of the reason things,

19:40.160 --> 19:45.200
which is what Dhamma is, not through, like, you know, watching the nostrils and then entering

19:45.200 --> 19:51.520
the astral projection of, I don't know what, here is also upon wisdom, here is also upon wisdom,

19:51.520 --> 19:56.720
he said, oh, he resolves upon, yeah, like, either he wants, once there is full confidence,

19:56.720 --> 20:02.800
full confidence establishes his mind, right there and then, which means he's living it and knowing it,

20:02.800 --> 20:07.920
or he fully discerns it and resolves upon wisdom, and then he also knows it.

20:11.680 --> 20:18.160
Let's read the other two ways, because it might fall, again, because a noble disciple

20:18.160 --> 20:24.800
goes, gone to the forest, or to the root of a tree, or 20 years, considers us, this is void

20:24.800 --> 20:30.240
of a self, or what belongs to a self, when he practice in this way and frequently abides us,

20:31.360 --> 20:39.120
his mind acquires confidence in this base, and avoidance, and so on, avoid off, so basically,

20:39.760 --> 20:45.920
as I said, the experience, the inner and experience gives priority to the sense of self,

20:45.920 --> 20:53.200
but with the right view, and, yeah, you go to physically to an empty room, the dissent,

20:53.200 --> 20:57.840
it's factually empty, and you use that reflection as factual emptiness of this room,

20:57.840 --> 21:05.440
it's the same mirroring situation of the emptiness of the sense of self in this experience,

21:05.440 --> 21:11.520
so, see, it's a negative presence, this room is empty of others,

21:11.520 --> 21:19.760
so others are present as absences in this room, others are absent here, so is this body,

21:19.760 --> 21:26.720
so is this mind and so on, absent of this self, so the self is only a negative phenomenon in regard

21:26.720 --> 21:33.440
to it, and if you start seeing it, the statue stops regarding it as yours, and you certainly

21:33.440 --> 21:39.600
stop regarding it as a center of your experience, you're seeing things like the body,

21:39.600 --> 21:43.040
empty yourself, it's not empty of body, it's empty, and it's empty of self,

21:43.040 --> 21:46.560
it's got a room there, it's got a body of feelings there, but it's empty of this,

21:48.800 --> 21:51.760
and that means that this doesn't exist, that's the whole thing,

21:53.280 --> 21:58.640
so now if you say, this room is empty, self doesn't know, itself exists, as an absence,

21:58.640 --> 22:03.600
as a thing that's not there, and that's enough for you to stop regarding it as yours,

22:03.600 --> 22:07.760
and that's all it matters, so that's the phenomenon that you've taken to be yourself,

22:07.760 --> 22:14.000
it's there, it's just not yours, that's a different way of saying that this experience here

22:14.000 --> 22:21.040
is empty of this, my self, so the self is absent, and through that absence I can't own it,

22:22.160 --> 22:26.320
because that absence is present, the absence of self is present,

22:26.960 --> 22:31.600
otherwise you'll be able to designate it and talk about it, but by recognizing it that it's

22:31.600 --> 22:37.680
absent means well it can't be yours, because if it's yours you'll have it all the time, so this is

22:37.680 --> 22:43.840
an empty sense of self, and that's enough for you to stop regarding it as belonging to you,

22:49.520 --> 22:55.040
then he attains the base of nothingness to you, well he attains the base of what

22:55.040 --> 23:01.600
voidness is it, well no, once there's full competency he detains to the base of nothingness,

23:01.600 --> 23:05.200
now or else he resolves upon it with wisdom, through the perception of voidness,

23:05.200 --> 23:11.360
yeah, so basically he stops appropriating any perception, this room is empty of self,

23:11.360 --> 23:16.080
thus through not being able to appropriate your sense of self there's nothing that belongs to you,

23:16.960 --> 23:23.520
you resolve upon that, means nothing there arises, nothing manifests, I none of the perceptions

23:23.520 --> 23:31.360
arise, no matter how sublime or diversified can be appropriated either, and that's pretty much

23:31.360 --> 23:40.480
nothingness, but you can't see nothingness in a direct manner, only by semantic perception,

23:40.480 --> 23:45.280
mind can get established upon nothingness, and you can demand the perception by resolving

23:45.280 --> 23:50.560
upon wisdom of like over the sphere of perception, outside of the perception, and so again,

23:50.560 --> 23:56.320
it's still even the resolving upon wisdom, it's still done, like you establish yourself upon

23:56.320 --> 24:03.200
nothingness in that negative manner, through wisely surmounting the sphere of perception,

24:04.720 --> 24:08.320
but it all revolves on appropriation, you will be the first example you gave of

24:08.320 --> 24:16.000
sensuality and different perceptions and so on, impetervable or the voidness, again voidness,

24:16.000 --> 24:25.440
oh, okay, it's nothing, nothing's there, nothing is there, nothingness, I was always

24:25.440 --> 24:29.440
once you imagine, nothing, you know, well that's the thing, imagination,

24:31.600 --> 24:36.080
if you mind this development in regard to your, or let's say more correctly, abstraction,

24:36.960 --> 24:40.640
some imagination, because it's kind of based on the facts, but you're not really living those

24:40.640 --> 24:45.600
facts, thus you're just abstract thinking, abstract thinking, it doesn't correspond,

24:45.600 --> 24:49.600
so if your mind was to be established upon that abstract thinking, you will cease to be abstract,

24:51.680 --> 24:56.400
you will become all, a valid thought that has served to establish your mind,

24:56.400 --> 25:00.160
like what we spoke before, you use more general perceptions to abandon more particular,

25:00.160 --> 25:04.720
more diversified, more troublesome, upon the perceptions of the forests, you abandon perceptions

25:04.720 --> 25:08.960
of the village, which means whatever disturbance arises on account of perceptions of the village

25:08.960 --> 25:14.480
cannot affect you, but the anything disturbance that arises on account of perceptions of the

25:14.480 --> 25:17.760
forest that can still affect you, so you recognize that, so you go even higher,

25:18.960 --> 25:22.640
what is the even greater perception of perception of forests and perception of earth,

25:23.920 --> 25:28.560
so what, then in this case you can go even higher than that, you can say well what is the perception

25:29.120 --> 25:31.920
perception of, the village perception of forest perception of earth,

25:32.480 --> 25:38.640
their old perceptions, and perception is, and the reason thing has to cease, thus whatever

25:38.640 --> 25:44.720
is perceived, whatever arises, has to come to an end, and that is, it is only upon that it's

25:44.720 --> 25:50.720
the experience of nothingness, the perception of nothingness. Well, yeah, you can then start

25:50.720 --> 25:55.440
discerning the perception of that nothing, so to speak, in regard to the positive perspective,

25:56.640 --> 26:01.280
perceptions that you have semantic, because obviously there's a semantic of that perception as well,

26:01.280 --> 26:10.720
but yeah, yeah, there is higher than base of nothingness as well. There's a third way to take,

26:10.720 --> 26:18.560
nothingness, basement. Again, because the noble disciples considers us, I am not anything belonging

26:18.560 --> 26:22.320
to anyone, anywhere. Well, what did they say just before? It's all about appropriation,

26:22.320 --> 26:27.440
belonging. Yeah, no, is there anything belonging to me in anyone, anywhere,

26:27.440 --> 26:32.880
yeah. When he practices in this way, if he can hear by and just asks, he's mind acquired confidence

26:32.880 --> 26:39.040
in this base, or just full confidence, he attains to the base of nothingness or result. That's

26:39.040 --> 26:44.640
the most refined way that would be, because it really points out the appropriation, the belonging,

26:45.440 --> 26:50.320
taking as mind, which is what I've been talking about so far. The first one is just

26:50.320 --> 26:56.320
sensuality. What was the other one? Essential perceptions?

26:57.680 --> 27:01.920
Essential pleas. Perceptions of form, and then perceptions of impetervable. Yeah.

27:03.520 --> 27:09.520
All of that already implies me and mind. For the second one, it's a bit more personal, so it's

27:09.520 --> 27:15.200
oh, these perceptions here, this room, as this room is void of others, so this is worry,

27:15.200 --> 27:21.360
but the third one, it's even more pointed out to just that experience of mind, not even necessarily

27:21.360 --> 27:26.640
the fully blown sense of self, but either way, whichever you take, if you develop it, it will

27:26.640 --> 27:30.400
lead you to that surmounting to the point of perception of nothing, that being established

27:30.400 --> 27:36.880
upon perception and nothingness. So by having nothing, like nothing here belongs to me,

27:37.600 --> 27:41.440
or do I belong to anyone, nothing in the future would belong to me, or will I belong to,

27:41.440 --> 27:46.960
nothing in the past has belonged to me, so that's not possible. And it's not possible for anything,

27:46.960 --> 27:51.200
so it's not that I didn't belong to me, but it could. Well, it says nothing in the future,

27:51.200 --> 27:55.920
that's what it means, means a present possibility. So nothing in the future will belong to me,

27:55.920 --> 28:01.840
is it's impossible for things to belong to me, and by truly permeating your whole experience

28:02.640 --> 28:07.840
with that recognition that ownership is inherently impossible.

28:07.840 --> 28:12.480
You surmount the entire sphere of ownership, which is the sphere of perceptions,

28:12.480 --> 28:18.560
the sphere of things that you can perceive, including abstract, remote, ambiguous thoughts,

28:18.560 --> 28:24.960
the appear as such you can add to the idea of ownership as mind, but fully cultivating this attitude,

28:24.960 --> 28:30.960
eventually it will permeate and saturate your experience entirely, in all of its sort of

28:31.920 --> 28:36.160
proliferated branches, so to speak, and that ownership of faith,

28:36.160 --> 28:42.400
is just because you recognize that the only reason you were entertaining the oceans of ownership

28:42.400 --> 28:50.400
was by not fully, not emotionally understanding that you were not able to own them in the first place.

28:52.480 --> 28:58.000
That's why you were owning them. You were appropriately in them because you didn't know that you

28:58.000 --> 29:04.560
actually can't. It's appropriation is inconceivable. And the stopping of that pursuit is,

29:04.560 --> 29:10.960
well, it's a result of that. Well, then pursuit will become equally inconceivable,

29:13.920 --> 29:18.720
because the entire nature of pursuit was based upon that misperception.

29:18.720 --> 29:30.880
When it goes on, it goes on to say that the base of neither perception or non-perceptions.

29:30.880 --> 29:39.520
It's the highest. So, as I said, negative, like what I gave these on before,

29:39.520 --> 29:44.080
the perceptions of forest, when you're in the village, your mind gets established

29:44.080 --> 29:49.760
upon perceptions of the forest, and when you're into the village, that perception of forest becomes

29:49.760 --> 29:55.840
a negative perception in regard to the current perceptions of the village. Because your mind is

29:55.840 --> 29:59.600
still established upon that perception, which is being perceived in a negative manner,

30:01.200 --> 30:05.440
nothing bothers you in the village, which you can perceive, which you might perceive.

30:06.560 --> 30:10.000
Then you recognize, okay, so I don't mean the forest when I'm in the village, if I'm established

30:10.000 --> 30:13.360
upon the perceptions of the forest, I'll be free from disturbing in the village,

30:13.360 --> 30:18.560
but not from the disturbance in the forest. And then the negative perception in regard to the

30:18.560 --> 30:24.240
forest and the village further down, it's the perception of earth, the entire earth, the element of earth.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.960
But that's a negative perception in regard to these more particular perceptions,

30:28.960 --> 30:34.640
or you can see more general perception. But it's a negative when you're perceiving other things.

30:34.640 --> 30:39.120
So, it's not there, it's present as an absent perception, and that's ultimately nothingness.

30:39.120 --> 30:44.400
She is that very nature, of that very principle. Quiet to me. Oops, sorry.

30:49.360 --> 30:54.480
So through cultivating the negative perception, you might get resolved upon it and establish

30:54.480 --> 31:00.400
in it. But even that is a perception in that negative manner, in that indirect manner, it's still

31:00.400 --> 31:05.680
our perception. Thus, neither perception or not perception would be state that goes even

31:05.680 --> 31:13.280
beyond that perception, of nothingness, of the absence, of the absence of the general yet.

31:20.480 --> 31:25.600
So as this village is absent of any forest, the perceptions of forest,

31:27.920 --> 31:33.920
so is this entire body that are now using this particular level walking through a village,

31:33.920 --> 31:40.880
is also absent of any owner, of any self that actually owns it, or are the more specifically,

31:40.880 --> 31:46.320
more precisely, as the third example says, of any belonging to the sense of self,

31:46.320 --> 31:51.360
or whatever arises in regard to it. Thus, the sense of self, or rather that which is taking

31:51.360 --> 31:56.080
to be the sense of self stays there, but it loses its ownership, loses its belonging thus,

31:56.080 --> 32:10.800
it's not really self anymore, so it's not yourself. And then you can surmount

32:10.800 --> 32:16.640
negative perception and no perception through the entire cessation of perception and feeling.

32:16.640 --> 32:30.320
I can't. Because it asserts when that big, when that big, who clings, assumes.

32:31.520 --> 32:36.480
He assumes to the best object of assumption, because he is the best object of assumption,

32:36.480 --> 32:42.880
namely the base, neither perception. Because if you assume, if your upadana is based upon

32:42.880 --> 32:46.160
neither perception or perception, meaning the mind has been developed to such an extended,

32:46.160 --> 32:51.360
connection descendant state, which means all of the more diversified states have been abandoned,

32:51.360 --> 32:57.760
and you cannot entertain any notions of ownership in regard to them. In the same sense,

32:57.760 --> 33:02.080
when you learn, and you get established upon the perceptions of forest and wilderness,

33:02.640 --> 33:08.160
the idea of a crowded place, the mind just will not go there.

33:08.160 --> 33:16.000
But imagine if you establish it to such a fine point, refinement whereby you surmount the perception

33:16.000 --> 33:26.560
in its entirety. Well, that is a sublime. And yeah, you can assume that, you can be kind of

33:26.560 --> 33:31.600
entertaining certain assumptions in regard to that, but that means that all the other assumptions,

33:31.600 --> 33:37.360
all of it. Not just the course ones, even the ones that regard the relatively non-course have been

33:37.360 --> 33:42.640
abandoned. So yeah, that is the place. If you want to cling to something, develop your mind and

33:42.640 --> 33:46.320
cling to them freely, because actually there isn't much there to cling onto.

33:48.240 --> 33:52.960
Yeah, there's a result of that. You will abandon all the other more dangerous assumptions.

33:57.440 --> 34:02.480
Yeah, because it says when someone is practicing for nibbana, they need to abandon that.

34:02.480 --> 34:09.600
Yeah, here because practicing thus, it might not be, and it might not be for me, it will not be,

34:09.600 --> 34:15.760
and it will not be for me, what exists, what has come to be. That's basically abandoning.

34:15.760 --> 34:22.880
Yeah, so there is, developing that reflection. They are not just, because as we said before,

34:23.760 --> 34:30.320
so yeah, it's not just the faith that you can on now, faith is to recognise that even a possibility

34:30.320 --> 34:37.200
of ownership cannot occur. Because you might think, okay, I don't know anything now,

34:37.840 --> 34:42.640
but you can still entertain implicitly, or I'll testively assume within that,

34:44.320 --> 34:49.040
ambiguous, simply assume by not looking at it. You end up assuming that

34:51.280 --> 34:54.960
tiny little remote possibility of ownership is still might be possible.

34:54.960 --> 35:02.000
And you will entertain that by default, simply by not entertaining it, but not looking at that

35:02.000 --> 35:08.160
possibility as impossible, you will automatically entertain the notion of that possibility.

35:08.160 --> 35:16.080
So, the reflection, it might not be, it will not even be possible for it to be for me, let alone

35:16.080 --> 35:25.600
be for me now. So, you really pervade, so to speak, the whole sphere of nature of possibility,

35:25.600 --> 35:30.800
which is much subtler than anything a reason present in front of you. So, I have this present

35:30.800 --> 35:34.320
thing, I don't know anything, but you still entertain the possibility of ownership.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.680
Even if you never give in to it, you might entertain it for the rest of your life,

35:39.680 --> 35:44.560
but if you want to pay this for Nirvana, an ultimate relic, you start really targeting,

35:44.560 --> 35:50.480
so to speak, those possibilities. Because, okay, it's obvious I don't own anything in front of me

35:50.480 --> 35:56.320
around me, anything in the past, see I couldn't have kept it, but you can still cherish tiny little

35:56.320 --> 36:05.040
notion of maybe just the possibility of ownership as an abstract idea, even that, but that will be the

36:05.040 --> 36:09.200
point that you're touching, the point that you're interfering with, the point that you didn't let go of.

36:09.200 --> 36:19.120
But if you practice, it will not be, it cannot be for me, it's impossible for it to be for me,

36:19.120 --> 36:25.120
it's just inconceivable, no matter what, when in the future, how far, how long in the future,

36:25.120 --> 36:31.440
it's just, it's impossible for this domain to touch, to come together and establish belonging,

36:31.440 --> 36:36.480
it's inconceivable. And you practice that long enough, presently, right here, right now,

36:36.480 --> 36:40.400
in regard to the future possibilities, and, yeah, that is Nirvana.

36:50.880 --> 36:54.960
Yes, well, again, this is what I meant, but again, the possibility is,

36:56.160 --> 37:01.600
the possibility is, yeah, okay. And as you can see, that gap can obviously stretch to

37:01.600 --> 37:06.960
very refined levels, you know, you can, you can surmount, and even protrusion, I can surmount the gap

37:06.960 --> 37:16.880
of sensual craving, but the gap of, like the future, only like the possibility of ownership can still

37:16.880 --> 37:27.600
be very much maintained. But by recognizing that that gap is insurmountable, that it's impossible

37:27.600 --> 37:34.960
to fail, impossible to bridge, you stop trying to build a bridge, you will keep trying to build a

37:34.960 --> 37:38.720
bridge, for as long as you think it's possible for it to work, it's possible to build it,

37:39.840 --> 37:46.160
you remove it, or rather you remove the hope, the notion of that possibility, you fully understand

37:46.160 --> 37:52.080
it as, oh no, this is impossible. And then all the efforts to build a bridge, just, you don't have

37:52.080 --> 37:58.400
to then, you automatically, they stop, they disappear. But all the key thing is all the suffering

37:58.400 --> 38:03.760
ends. Of course, then, yeah, yeah. Because the result of the suffering was craving for the bridge,

38:05.120 --> 38:09.200
and you think that the bridge will give it all the suffering, but in fact,

38:09.200 --> 38:14.160
but you were suffering because of you were basically trying to build that bridge, trying to gap,

38:14.800 --> 38:20.000
trying to surmount, trying to cross, that's which is impossible to, trying to connect that which is

38:20.000 --> 38:38.560
well, in connectable, yeah. And as you can see, simply through thinking that it is possible

38:38.560 --> 38:45.440
to build a bridge over that gap, of your existence, you appropriate it, you appropriate the other

38:45.440 --> 38:52.000
sure, you appropriate the possibility of being on the other side, where that bridge is built,

38:52.000 --> 38:59.920
and the whole thing has been, has been filled and connected and unified. But through seeing,

38:59.920 --> 39:04.160
now this is impossible, you stop entertaining the notions of, or the other side of the gap,

39:05.040 --> 39:10.960
of ownership. And you can see, through ownership, you maintain the notion of building a,

39:10.960 --> 39:16.080
of crossing, of building a bridge, or through the efforts of building a bridge, the assumption that

39:16.080 --> 39:22.080
it's possible to be able to fill that gap, you keep, you keep assuming the ownership of,

39:22.080 --> 39:26.240
of the result of filling that gap, of that, of that other side, that you can cross here and

39:26.240 --> 39:31.440
not bridge it, yeah. So even if you, yeah, even if you don't necessarily try and hear it now,

39:31.440 --> 39:36.320
even in practicing restraint, the failure you maintain in the notion that it is possible to connect

39:36.320 --> 39:42.960
with that other, at the side of that gap, means you are still very much within the assumption.

39:42.960 --> 39:47.680
You're choosing not to. Even if you're choosing not to, yeah, you still own the other show,

39:47.680 --> 39:52.720
through the possibility of, oh, I can cross there, to building this bridge over this insurmountable gap.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.680
You fully descend, it's insurmountable, you reckon that was, that is peace, the peace was not

39:57.680 --> 40:01.440
unifying broken pieces or whatever else, the peace was abandoning them all.

40:01.440 --> 40:08.160
Because if you have broken pieces of a vase, for as long as you hold onto the perceptions of a vase,

40:08.720 --> 40:12.560
those pieces will be, well, will be valuable, will be useful, it will be

40:13.440 --> 40:18.640
object of your effort to bring back the vase, to build it up as it was before, or whatever notions

40:18.640 --> 40:24.000
you might entertain, or emotional attachment towards it. But if you say, I don't care about it

40:24.000 --> 40:30.800
anymore, all those pieces become literally worldless, entirely. So when you, and especially when

40:30.800 --> 40:36.800
you recognize that you can't have the vase, and well, you couldn't have had it, because if it was

40:36.800 --> 40:42.320
truly your vase all the time, you wouldn't have been broken in the first place. You have been

40:42.320 --> 40:47.520
full control over it, but it's independent of you. In the same sense, this gap that you're trying

40:47.520 --> 40:52.720
to surmount by pursuing your designs, it's independent of you, thus it's insurmountable, thus only

40:52.720 --> 40:58.480
through the notions of surmounting it, you are yourself fully responsible for maintaining the constant

40:58.480 --> 41:04.880
presence of the desire. You stop maintaining that desire of fate, causing these maintenance.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.320
That's when you really said, the object of desire is more desire.

41:10.480 --> 41:18.960
So the sole purpose of desire is the presence of desire.

41:22.480 --> 41:27.200
You don't see that, because desire kind of tricks you by projecting your look. That's what

41:27.200 --> 41:31.200
you're desiring for, so you don't see the nature of desire, because you're focused on a particular

41:31.200 --> 41:37.440
manifestation of it. You know that desire is ready for food. Yeah, desire is filled by itself,

41:37.440 --> 41:43.440
by being a desire. That's fine with itself, only through the discrepancy which you then assume

41:43.440 --> 41:51.120
feels incomplete, but your full response is there for that. So you know how people, the notion

41:51.120 --> 41:55.680
is there's a desire, and obviously there's a projected discrepancy of a fulfilment of desire.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.800
If I do this and this and this, my desire will be fulfilled. So then you crave for that,

41:59.600 --> 42:07.440
and that's how you maintain the notion of desire. So you could equally, so to speak,

42:08.320 --> 42:16.240
fulfill your desire by forgetting about your desire. So you feel like, oh if I pursue my desire,

42:16.240 --> 42:21.440
I fulfill my desire. Equal to that pursuit, you could equally do that, just forget about your

42:21.440 --> 42:26.960
desire, and your desire will be equally fulfilled, because you must fulfill to begin with desire in

42:26.960 --> 42:32.160
itself, it's a very phenomenal reason and such, perfectly sufficient by itself in itself.

42:33.680 --> 42:38.960
But the discrepancy created is in regard to another projected scenario that it's incomplete in

42:38.960 --> 42:44.320
regard to this, but in itself it's quite complete. So if you were to forget about the scenario,

42:44.320 --> 42:51.520
the discrepancy is forgotten about, thus desire is complete. It's easy, it's gone.

42:51.520 --> 42:55.840
It's just forgetful, you can't just forget. Well no, what I mean, forgetting about desire,

42:55.840 --> 43:02.560
it's restrained. Yeah. Because by restraining, you stop pursuing it and then it falls off and

43:02.560 --> 43:08.800
then you start thinking about something else. Yeah. Oh my desire. Oh, if you can, if you can

43:08.800 --> 43:15.200
selectively forget only about desires, but don't forget about your forgetting, that's all right.

43:15.200 --> 43:22.640
Yeah, we fulfill all your desires by restraining. Yeah, yeah, it would, they would be true for

43:22.640 --> 43:30.160
family, it would bring all desires to an end to the cessation. So you cure your age by not

43:30.160 --> 43:39.440
ditching, by not scratching, because scratching makes his making worse. Is that simple? It's just

43:39.440 --> 43:42.560
most people are not strong enough to persist in non-scratching.

43:47.840 --> 43:52.000
But the reason they're not strong enough is because they don't practice, they don't develop strength,

43:52.000 --> 44:01.360
and thus, they're fully responsible for being weak, for being unable to restrain. Thus, they're

44:01.360 --> 44:08.320
fully responsible for being poor by their desire. Yeah, I was, I was going to the beginning of that

44:08.320 --> 44:16.480
sutra, the nature, supine, and it would have started with the biggest, central pleasures,

44:16.480 --> 44:23.200
impermanent, hollow, false, deceptive. They are illusory. The Prattle of Fools.

44:24.960 --> 44:28.720
Central pleasures here and now, and central pleasures in life to come, central pleasures,

44:29.680 --> 44:34.880
perceptions here and now, central perceptions in life to come. Both alike are Mara's realm,

44:35.520 --> 44:41.440
Mara's domain, Mara's bait, Mara's hunting ground. When I count to them, these evil unwholesome

44:41.440 --> 44:49.120
mental states such as covetousness, evil will, and presumption arise, and they constitute an

44:49.120 --> 44:54.160
obstruction to a noble disciple in training here. I don't know what presumption is.

44:55.520 --> 44:59.520
Well, I don't know what a parable it is. If he traces it, I know that. It doesn't matter,

44:59.520 --> 45:05.920
you get a context from the other. But when he, when a Biku considers our central pleasures here and

45:05.920 --> 45:12.880
now, and so on, constitutes an obstruction in the training, suppose I go to abide with the

45:12.880 --> 45:18.960
mind abundant and exalted, having transcended the world and made a firm determination with the mind.

45:18.960 --> 45:22.320
When I do so, there will be no more un-evil unwholesome mental states.

45:25.280 --> 45:31.920
And with the bending of their mind, my mind will be unlimited, immeasurable and well-developed.

45:31.920 --> 45:36.480
When he practices in this way, and frequently abides us, his mind acquires confidence in this

45:36.480 --> 45:40.720
place. And they become the know. The inter... the know.

45:43.120 --> 45:50.160
Yeah, it requires development. And that's how from abstraction is brought down to the actuality.

45:51.840 --> 45:55.040
If you read the first time, oh, it's his abstract, but if you actually start pondering,

45:55.040 --> 45:59.760
discerning, establishing and understanding upon it, and then you abide in it frequently enough,

45:59.760 --> 46:04.400
it becomes a know. And it becomes a state that your mind is attained.

46:07.280 --> 46:10.160
It could also, I think she says, it is maras.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.160
Maras fear.

46:12.160 --> 46:15.120
It's maras stuff, those perceptions.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.880
And what is maras thing?

46:16.880 --> 46:21.520
And what does he mean by saying this is maras? It means it's not yours. It means it cannot be yours.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.640
It means it's owned by another.

46:22.640 --> 46:29.760
By mara. That's what it is. It's because people take them which belongs to mara.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.720
Mara does with them what he wants. What do they take?

46:33.520 --> 46:37.360
Or rather, what is it that belongs to mara? It says, I belongs to mara.

46:37.360 --> 46:42.080
I phones belong to mara. Here belongs to mara. Sounds belong to mara.

46:43.680 --> 46:47.200
Well, both the perceptions and the interity belongs to mara.

46:47.200 --> 46:52.720
There would be someone saying that there is a self and there is a there.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.400
No, there is a self, but it's not yours.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.520
It's maras. Mara is the ultimate self.

47:01.520 --> 47:05.440
She just had to stop regarding it as my end has this way.

47:05.440 --> 47:10.160
The thing says, stop regarding that it is possible to be yours.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.280
Even if you're not taking it, it might be possible.

47:13.280 --> 47:16.960
You should start thinking, no, it will not be possible.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.280
It is not possible. It cannot be possible.

47:20.800 --> 47:23.680
So whenever the good it talks about the future and in this certain, it says,

47:23.680 --> 47:25.200
any it will not be for me in the future.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.480
Central pleasures here and now are central pleasures to come.

47:29.520 --> 47:32.640
It doesn't matter. It's possibility of central pleasures.

47:33.520 --> 47:37.600
It's equally impossible to be mine as much as these present central pleasures are.

47:38.720 --> 47:41.760
And through abandon that possibility, you actually abandon the present.

47:41.760 --> 47:47.840
Not that way around, because possibility is subtly than there is in actual aspects.

47:51.600 --> 47:57.920
More general, possible it is more general. They are on the more general level here.

47:57.920 --> 48:14.400
So the sense of self in regard to your senses, in regard to experience as a whole,

48:15.680 --> 48:22.000
it's appropriate. It's regard dear and personal. It's welcomed, it's cherished, it's protected.

48:22.960 --> 48:26.640
You do the opposite. You let go of it, you dismantle it,

48:26.640 --> 48:31.680
you see that it's impossible to own it. And then that very sense of self, it's right here right now

48:31.680 --> 48:36.000
in the center of your experience, no matter how vague it is, that sense of self, that's mara.

48:37.360 --> 48:44.560
Right here, in your core, which wasn't your core. It was his core and it was his all the time.

48:49.600 --> 48:53.600
That's how much I say, mara, I see you, I see you, you're doing this, I can see you.

48:53.600 --> 48:59.040
They see themselves thinking that, but they know, because that's not appropriate anymore.

48:59.040 --> 49:03.680
It's a mara, that's self is a mara, and that is his control, that is his domain, that's where

49:03.680 --> 49:08.400
you control all the beings, because they're appropriate, that which is his, that which is him.

49:08.400 --> 49:20.800
So it's his mara, just another way of saying it, it's like religion, it will be, well definitely.

49:20.800 --> 49:25.040
Yeah, it's just basically, of Egypt personified.

49:25.040 --> 49:30.240
Yeah, so you mean, so you don't see that's the thing, of Egypt personified,

49:30.240 --> 49:34.160
but you don't, you can't get rid of that personification, because there will be a

49:34.160 --> 49:40.960
appropriation of it. If you were to truly be able to get rid of the personality, so to speak,

49:42.880 --> 49:47.200
means, well, there will be a person, you will be in control of it, but you can't.

49:47.920 --> 49:54.400
So what we can do is stop regarding it as your own, and that is actually true, get rid of,

49:54.400 --> 50:00.560
getting rid of. And that's when that personality, if it is owned, cannot be owned,

50:00.560 --> 50:05.440
fully understood, discern that you cannot possibly own it, that's when it just becomes manifested

50:05.440 --> 50:10.080
in the individuality, of these five aggregates arising, certain manners based on certain habits,

50:10.080 --> 50:16.960
certain dry-up notions or whatever else, but no more, no more obedience, certainly, no more

50:16.960 --> 50:25.600
person as in belonging to you or to anyone. This does not belong to me, nor to anyone, it's impossible

50:25.600 --> 50:32.880
for it to belong. That's why Mara still comes to Buddha. Yeah, exactly, because that is Mara's

50:32.880 --> 50:39.200
domain, but the Buddha is not there, so Mara can see it, or Mara can't see it in Aranya,

50:40.640 --> 50:46.320
because he's just not there anymore, ever, even as a possibility, Aranya is not there anymore.

50:46.320 --> 50:52.560
It's impossible for him to be there anymore, where Mara can see, where that personality can take

50:52.560 --> 50:55.600
a grip of him again, it's impossible. The mind is what will be on it.

51:05.680 --> 51:11.040
It's quite straightforward in a way, if the mind is developed to the proper discernment of

51:11.040 --> 51:18.000
an arisenomy, be it a thought, a feeling, a perception of this kind of that kind, it's a reason.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.760
You start training with that, well, all of these things will kind of fit into place.

51:29.520 --> 51:34.640
And again, there's nothing to do with watching a nostrils and entering the mystical absorption

51:34.640 --> 51:48.240
states. It resolves upon the wisdom. So, it resolves upon it with wisdom.

51:48.240 --> 52:03.360
Do me a boy, come here. I like the way the Buddha, the sutras, ended.

52:05.440 --> 52:11.040
And when he says this, this is meditator under, do not delay, or else you will regret it later.

52:12.400 --> 52:17.680
Because there is no reason delay. You can't only try here right now, and that possibility of

52:17.680 --> 52:25.680
future ownership is present right here right now. So, delaying it means obstructing it unnecessarily.

52:29.680 --> 52:37.680
So, don't do it. Really, don't delay. Why for? The delay would come from that misperception that,

52:37.680 --> 52:45.360
I would say, you got the sensuality, distortion. That's where delay comes from.

52:45.360 --> 52:49.040
We have to keep on to maintain itself. The matter was to maintain it. It is controlled.

52:59.200 --> 53:03.920
So, people think their thoughts are abstract, but it's actually other way around.

53:07.040 --> 53:11.280
It's experience, present experience right here, that it's abstract in regard to thoughts.

53:11.280 --> 53:18.880
Thoughts come first, mind comes first. But because, as I said before, because your experience

53:18.880 --> 53:24.080
or potusion is so centered around the center self, that is the center of the universe.

53:24.080 --> 53:27.280
Me and mine, I am the reference point to everything. That's the real.

53:27.280 --> 53:30.720
That's the real, which means you're always bound with the senses, with the sensual,

53:30.720 --> 53:34.480
with the material aspects of things and so on. Means that becomes your norm.

53:34.480 --> 53:39.760
So, then even the most ordinary thoughts are regarded as, oh, this is just abstract,

53:39.760 --> 53:46.960
because every thought seems abstract. I abstract it from your current experience that you're used to.

53:46.960 --> 53:50.560
Thoughts seem almost unreal. That's where many people think thoughts are not real. I just

53:50.560 --> 53:57.440
think my head. Because they got so bogged down in the sensual aspect of their experience,

53:57.440 --> 54:04.800
their minds are so down in that domain, that sort of lowly sphere, that even the mere thinking

54:04.800 --> 54:11.760
feels abstract. But that's only because they're so used to this sphere of sensual,

54:11.760 --> 54:17.200
sphere of senses and domain of senses and control of senses. If somebody is to point out to you,

54:17.200 --> 54:21.840
that as the wrong way around, to turn the picture upside down, and which is first,

54:21.840 --> 54:26.400
you were putting second, well, somebody corrects that. Then you reckon, no, thoughts are the real,

54:26.400 --> 54:31.520
thoughts are the center. The nature of thoughts, I don't mean just thinking any sort of nonsense

54:31.520 --> 54:36.560
in regard to your senses. I mean, the nature of thoughts is the center of your experience,

54:36.560 --> 54:40.720
and it's your experience that you're living, that is the abstraction from that.

54:43.520 --> 54:49.200
If you stop doing, if you stop maintaining that abstraction, if you acknowledge the nature of

54:49.200 --> 54:56.000
thoughts as present things that you could just designated, you will stop living that discrepancy,

54:56.000 --> 55:04.720
that which is abstraction, which means by basically, by freeing yourself of the notions of abstraction

55:04.720 --> 55:09.680
in regard to your own experience, you will be suffering less because they will be less discrepancy

55:09.680 --> 55:19.680
created for such notions. So for Protuginum, thoughts are real. The rest of his experience

55:19.680 --> 55:25.840
is an abstraction. It's a big mistake. It's a distortion, as the Buddha said, in terms of sensuality.

55:27.440 --> 55:33.200
And because they're so bound with that distortion, they think that's the real thing.

55:33.200 --> 55:38.400
And then that, which is, doesn't match it, in regard as well, this is abstracted from it.

55:38.400 --> 55:42.480
You say, if I have the thought of nothing as thought of impermanable, the thought,

55:42.480 --> 55:49.840
the image is the thought. If you dismiss it as just a thought, well, as I said before, you don't

55:49.840 --> 55:55.520
just shoot yourself in a foot, you shoot yourself in the head, unless you seriously change the notion

55:55.520 --> 56:00.400
because you'll never then recognize the nature of thoughts, which means you'll never then

56:00.400 --> 56:07.200
recognize the nature of your mind, because mind is thoughts, tamas. I mean, damma, the capital D

56:07.200 --> 56:15.120
is the knowledge of tamas, like the small D. It's the phenomenology, the knowledge of phenomena.

56:17.440 --> 56:22.080
But if you dismiss anything that appears in your mind as just an abstraction,

56:23.920 --> 56:28.880
you'll never look at it, which means you remain bogged down in sensuality, which is what you

56:28.880 --> 56:37.120
have at the time of dismissal. Oh, you dismiss any helping hand, you're just going to stay drowning.

56:41.280 --> 56:47.760
So when you have notions of the, nothingness, what we spoke about, that feels abstract in

56:47.760 --> 56:53.040
regard to where your mind is, because your mind hasn't been developed. So don't dismiss it on

56:53.040 --> 57:00.560
that account. Just start developing it in regard to that, which feels abstract. Because the

57:00.560 --> 57:05.120
money development, the more you know about it, the less of that discrepancy will be maintained,

57:05.120 --> 57:10.880
which means the less of the abstraction you will be living. So then you will understand,

57:10.880 --> 57:15.280
and you will be able to think nothingness right away, and have your mind set upon it.

57:15.280 --> 57:24.400
And as I said with the alternative option is, depending on person's background,

57:24.400 --> 57:30.640
it is, he resolves upon it with wisdom. That means he doesn't necessarily need to

57:32.080 --> 57:38.480
develop it and make it actual to the full extent, because he has such a precise wisdom

57:38.480 --> 57:45.200
that when people would think abstractly, he would think correctly. Well, he would think,

57:45.200 --> 57:49.920
the person has always been, would stand for that with nothing that is, and he would know that,

57:49.920 --> 57:55.840
even without actually being there. So he resolves upon that with his wisdom. He resolves,

57:55.840 --> 58:00.960
it is that. That is what nothingness is. And he resolves upon it. And because that is what nothing

58:00.960 --> 58:07.600
ness really is, he gets results of freedom that would come by being established upon that nothingness.

58:07.600 --> 58:13.200
And that is pain in liberty, that is deliberately liberated by wisdom. He resolves upon it with wisdom,

58:13.200 --> 58:18.560
stays very long enough, all the fetters fall off. Then you have the other way,

58:18.560 --> 58:22.800
he is liberating them both in both ways. We experience who touches it with the body as the

58:22.800 --> 58:27.280
suttas will describe. That is when that discrepancy between living body and the senses,

58:27.280 --> 58:38.960
not full faith. It is fully developed. Sorry, fully semantic, fully extinguished. But abstract,

58:38.960 --> 58:44.880
it is only abstract, if that discrepancy is created by what you are used to, that doesn't match that

58:44.880 --> 59:00.160
with your thinking. What is it? What is it? What is it? No, we can't go for a walk now.

59:00.160 --> 59:22.720
Okay, take a crack, get out. Okay, go. Good boy. No, it was just done. Okay, now give it to the monkey.

59:30.720 --> 59:36.160
So if some of your thinking feels abstract, don't dismiss the thinking, just take that,

59:36.160 --> 59:42.160
oh, there is a work to be done. It's abstract only because my present experience, present bodily

59:42.160 --> 59:47.040
experience doesn't match it. Can't comprehend it. Well, comprehend it and you'll match it.

59:47.840 --> 59:52.320
But the abstract thought of nothingness is a sign. It's still a valid direction.

59:53.520 --> 59:58.240
Based to what you read about nothingness. Like say somebody completely different,

59:58.240 --> 01:00:05.280
doesn't follow any dharma, starts talking about nothingness. Well, then even that abstract thought

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:11.360
of that nothingness, these other different different different school teachers talking about,

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.640
won't necessarily be the right direction either because it's so much off. But if you read the

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.240
sutras and when the Buddha talks about nothingness, having the faith in the Buddha and so on,

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:25.680
then well, you can be pretty certain that you might not have experienced nothingness,

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.840
have certainly not been established upon it, but you can be pretty certain that at least the

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.440
direction where a abstract thought took you, it's probably the right one. Because it's, you know,

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:40.960
it's so vague in general, you really need to be seriously misled by instruction to go off that.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.720
Now of course, there is a lot of work to go into that direction. But as I said, by reading the

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:54.000
sutras, you can be rest assured that, well, at least the directions through your abstract thinking

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.200
that you are getting in terms of the instructions are probably slightly right, which is why it's

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:06.320
important to have the right instruction, no matter how general it is. Now if you were not

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.560
to read the sutras, you could some other stuff where the present is Buddhism or not. Thank you

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:19.600
throw you off completely. But in this case, the sutras, the sutras, when you read, and that's why

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.160
if you keep reading about the sutras, you will be out any other input or explanation. If you,

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.520
obviously, with this kind of view, okay, abstract thinking is a direction that I need to develop

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:37.360
where it is, is to be abstract. Then if you keep reading the sutras, that direction will crystallize

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:42.160
more and more, because you'll be thinking about it, you'll be pondering it, you'll be, as the

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.120
others say, you'll be investigating meaning, you wouldn't believe me anything and turned, so you'll

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.080
be working basically, you'll be walking in the beginning like it then you go east, so you just

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:58.080
are going east, but you can go far off in many directions that are east, but you still keep going,

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.480
which means the further you go, it will start narrowing down, then you get more signs, more

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.640
instructions, then you recognize more of previous instructions that you heard that you couldn't make

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.080
much of at the time, which means your direction will get more and more focused and pointed out,

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:20.240
which means you get more precise. But none of that would be possible, if you admit, sorry,

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:28.400
if you dismissed the abstract thinking, it is very arising because it's just thinking,

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:34.240
it's just abstract, this is real, that's abstract, no, that's equally real, it's abstract only in

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.280
regard to what you think it's more real and you're a professional, thus you should not be trusting

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.240
what you think that it's more real, because if that is truly the real thing, you wouldn't be

01:02:44.240 --> 01:03:11.200
trusting, you wouldn't be free from suffering, you wouldn't be allowed.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.280
So don't dismiss abstract thinking, try to point it in the right direction through

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.560
leading settlers and things that are at least likely to be wrong, and then keep bringing.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.040
Like, that's what I mean when I tell you, I have to be able to explain things to yourself,

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.840
don't leave them vague, undefined, yeah, it feels like this, sort of feels like, no, what does it mean?

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.880
No either meaning means understanding it, knowing that there is nothing to be understood in

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.600
these particular things means you understand them, and they are not worth understanding of pursuing

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:57.200
further. So that's why by reading this with this economy, you should be able to explain to

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:03.040
yourself, okay, so it still feels abstract when I think about nothingness, but what it is, what is

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.960
my, what is the meaning of it for me to that, at that point? What does it mean? How did I understand it?

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.720
It doesn't mean you start going to some like psychotherapy, spiritual terminology where you

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.760
should just start a while, it's like this, and it feels like, and it feels, no, what does it mean?

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.520
I'm not asking this guy how you feel, what does it mean? Where is your understanding yet?

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:33.040
And most importantly, is that understanding contributing to a freedom of suffering and freedom from

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:40.960
possibility to suffer? That is present. And if the understanding pertains to that, if understanding

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:48.400
feels directly related or directly correlated to the freedom from suffering, then carry on.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.920
But if it's irrelevant, oh, I feel like this, or I feel like that, well, they make some

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.640
difference. Feelings there, that's your suffering regarding your feelings. Well, I feel,

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.040
I feel like, superman today, I feel untouchable, I feel impertellable. Well, great,

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.520
what are you going to do when you're feeling ceases? So you just establish your peace upon your

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:12.960
feeling, yet the whole problem of not being free, not being peaceful, is depending upon feelings,

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.880
being affected by them.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:22.480
Yeah, that's up to you. No, that's not your peteo, that's what I mean. So don't just

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.960
give into any kind of flamboyant description of what you might feel like when you think about

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.960
nothingness. No, actually, develop it, so you don't suffer on a count of it. Otherwise,

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:37.920
the weather wouldn't have laid it as a way out of suffering. So if it doesn't pertain to a

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.360
freedom from suffering, means you're doing it wrong, or it's a wrong instruction, but it's

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.720
since came from the weather. It's not the wrong instruction, that's you're doing it wrong.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:52.960
So it's always a good criteria of, okay, I've been pursuing this line of thinking in regard to

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:59.200
base of nothingness. I've been dwelling on the notions of this. Can I know, can I suffer less

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.480
on a count of it? And just like you, you're intelligence, you could see, this seems that if I were to

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:09.920
develop it, I would be untouchable by the unpleasant feeling when it rises, because they would also,

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.720
because feeling is inseparable from perception, and if I'm entirely surmounting the perception,

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.360
and free from it, and established in that base that's higher than that perception, none of the

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.600
feelings that arise on the count of that perception that can perceive can affect me because they

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.240
will pertain to perception, not to me, because I'm out of that perception.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.160
So, yeah, it is strange.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:43.440
Or even less extra. I mean, it's abstract for somebody who just reminds us far removed from it,

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:48.320
but again, as a thought, as a valid direction, it must not be dismissed in any cost.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.560
Even if you don't necessarily follow it to such an extent, you can just go back to the obvious one,

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.440
upon the perceptions of the forest, your abandoned perceptions of the village, perceptions of

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:03.760
the crowded life, perceptions of the people, perceptions of centrality, to see the perceptions,

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.320
which have the flavor of freedom, the taste of it, isn't it?

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:16.000
Yeah, these perceptions are not clearly developed them, but it seems to me, based on my

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.160
limited discernment at this point, they're more likely to result in freedom than perceptions

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:28.240
of hanging on the village. So then, I should follow them. And then by following them,

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:33.040
you can close it to other perceptions that are there. And then you actually, oh yeah, no,

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:40.240
I was right. Where you define your taste of freedom, you gain confidence in the taste of freedom.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.800
And then you know, oh, it is free.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:55.920
Because if abstract thinking of freedom would stand for that, which freedom actually is freedom

01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:02.080
from craving, freedom of suffering, what you have to do is keep repeating it, and you will be

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.560
resolved upon it. You're walking in that direction. Well, no, you'll be resolved upon it,

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.160
which means everything will be dragged into that direction, the rest of your experience,

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.920
because you anchored it there, and give it some time, and all the factors will follow.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.600
And then you realize, yeah, this was right, even as an abstract thought, he was very accurate.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.640
He's just always, I was dismissing it, because I was so centered at the opposite end.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:33.200
But fortunately, out of faith and persistence, I kept doing it, and I headed the route,

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:38.480
and I headed anchor there, and look, all this, all this experience that was bogged down in

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:45.840
sensuality, the mind that was fully controlled, and just disturbed, and abused by centrality,

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.400
and everything else has been dragged out, and look, now it's there, where any perturbing ball is,

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.800
and all that swamp is abandoned. And that's abstract now.

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.440
You're thinking about sensuality, that you have full understood, as pretty much inconceivable,

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:10.160
it's impossible to own, that's abstract thinking, because you're abstracted from it.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.960
So you can see how much harm can be caused by the casual Buddhist advice that you often read

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.520
and hear, or just stop thinking. Ignoring all the contradictions that are

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:37.360
said, sentence will imply, oh yeah, thoughts are the problem, I stopped thinking, and I'm at peace.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.800
And you'll never try to think properly, and you certainly will never be able to, well,

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:55.760
to think, to develop your mind. And again, when I say things, I don't mean just sit and theorize,

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.760
or rationalize, what makes sense to you in your protrusion ascent that experience around your senses,

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:08.480
well, that the thinking is slave to the senses, but it's the other way around, or it should be, at least.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.600
So developing the thinking is based on the suitors, however abstract, don't dismiss it,

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.720
but actually pursue their direction, and then it will cease to be abstract.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.200
One thing for sure, none of these states,

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.680
it's based on nothingness, based on either perception or perception, one intent upon divana will be

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:36.480
arising by a chance, given to you by some meditative technique that kind of just made these things happen.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:44.720
No, you develop them through discerning what they are, so then if you're a thought of what they

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.600
are, is accurate thought, that's it, you're rooted in them, now you have to keep doing it,

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.640
long enough until the fetters fade, that's the right view, the right view is the knowledge of

01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.880
me, knowledge of freedom from suffering. Now you can pursue it or you can choose to be distracting

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.880
in regard to it, but you can't forget about it. So at most, in several lifetimes, you'll do away

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:13.520
with all the fetters, but maybe even before. Yeah, that's what it talks about, sort of patterns,

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.480
being reborn, no, all of them need to sit through seven lifetimes, some of them become lions,

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:24.880
before they land into another river, so like a loose translation, or a pond landing,

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.280
or in the space in between, all those polythumes, which means you could have taken to different

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:38.480
faculties and then even in that state in between, you carry on, you carry on the development of

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:46.000
the right view. Yeah, so at most, several lifetimes, but not necessarily. It's depending on how much

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.640
effort, how much effort you put into it. Yeah, how accurate your thoughts of what

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.560
nibane is actually are, because there is no, and that's one thing you realize,

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:02.720
what you think nibane is can be right or wrong, but you can't have a reference point

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.920
to it externally whereby you see, okay, there is a nibane and now I can correct my thinking, no,

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.400
because you can only see it from the inside, so you will know that this is the right thinking

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.480
when you're fully free from suffering, and then you're okay. That's why sometimes anagami

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.000
overestimated themselves, they thought they were fully nibane, but they were not quite,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.280
because the things get a bit subtler later on, in terms of conceit and so on, so some people might

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.800
not necessarily see if the circumstances are not prompting them to see it, but the point is,

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:36.240
you can't have an external view of anything, which means then your abstract thinking,

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:42.640
or non abstract thinking, is all you have to stand for that thing, which you're aiming at for freedom.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.680
That's what I meant in the S in not perceiving the feeling and determined determinations,

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.760
that because of which you have thoughts of that, because of which you have thoughts,

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:58.160
which means you can only think in regard to that, which you're thinking, but that's already

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.000
another thought that you're thinking, which means you can't step outside of your thought,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.400
right along where you should dismiss it. So all you have to do then is make sure you stop assuming

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:15.520
that thought to be that, which it isn't, and then that thought will stand for that, which that

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:23.680
thought is. In other way, have an accurate thought of what nibane is, have an accurate thought of

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.080
what the way out of suffering is, have an accurate thought of what craving is, have an accurate

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.240
thought of what matter is, have an accurate thought of what feeling is, have an accurate thought

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.760
of what perception is, have an accurate thought of what intentions are, have an accurate thought of

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:41.600
what consciousness is. Because through any inaccurate thought, you introduce assumption,

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.680
because that's it, the discrepancy of inaccuracy is the extent of your assumption,

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:57.680
extent of your opinion.
