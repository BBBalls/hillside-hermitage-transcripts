00:00.000 --> 00:14.680
What is a real blessing?

00:14.680 --> 00:16.960
What is the real blessing?

00:16.960 --> 00:23.840
Sometimes people ask monks for blessings, but what is the real blessing?

00:23.840 --> 00:33.440
Well, I guess you can define it a blessing is something that's going to be beneficial for

00:33.440 --> 00:39.520
your well-being in the future.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.200
That's just off the top of my head to define blessing.

00:43.200 --> 00:52.880
So if you take that as a criteria, then you can see that actually fundamentally you are

00:52.880 --> 00:57.200
the only one who is responsible for your own blessings.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.040
You can't have somebody bless you.

00:59.040 --> 01:06.240
Well, you can have somebody bless you if somebody comes and tells you what to do, properly

01:06.240 --> 01:14.920
accurately in terms of the mind development, in terms of the virtuous life and that kind

01:14.920 --> 01:15.920
of inner growth.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.800
Yeah, that person is sort of giving you blessings.

01:19.800 --> 01:24.920
I.e. he's basically giving you opportunity to bless yourself.

01:24.920 --> 01:30.800
But most often people just resort to blessings as a form of superstition, which is the

01:30.800 --> 01:36.920
sole point of it is to cover up the existential anxiety, fear of basically life, because you

01:36.920 --> 01:41.120
recognize that you're not in your life, you're bound with the life, you're bound with your

01:41.120 --> 01:44.560
attachments, with your wants, with your desires, with everything.

01:44.560 --> 01:49.240
But deep down you know you're not in control of it, and any second it can be taken away.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.400
So that recognition is dreadful.

01:52.400 --> 01:58.680
So a person without any wisdom, without an instruction of guidance would basically have

01:58.680 --> 02:01.680
to turn towards distracting himself from it.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.680
But sooner or later it starts to catch up and that's when people become religious, superstitious,

02:06.680 --> 02:11.040
engaging all sorts of rituals and blessings and needs, just to to mark, to cover up to

02:11.040 --> 02:12.760
like, no, I will be fine.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.560
Because you recognize that fact that you're not in control right here and now and that

02:15.560 --> 02:19.880
your future is uncertain, because you might not live next moment.

02:19.880 --> 02:24.960
But blessings being pertaining to your well-being in the future, you feel blessed now, you sort

02:24.960 --> 02:27.800
of smooth over the anxieties of the future.

02:27.800 --> 02:32.680
So you basically bring you some sort of peace, but it's not a, it's not a, it's not actually

02:32.680 --> 02:37.680
peace that kind of fixes the problem, it's the peace that comes from ignoring the problem,

02:37.680 --> 02:40.680
which is not really the peace.

02:40.680 --> 02:49.560
So being virtuous yourself being virtuous yourself, may keeping the acts of virtue, upholding

02:49.560 --> 02:58.640
the virtue, upholding the non-ill will, non-sensuality, non-hatred, non-slender, wrong speech, inciting

02:58.640 --> 03:05.320
violence, anything basically and wholesome, non-indulgence, you can, you can be rest sort of

03:05.320 --> 03:15.960
assured that that is, that is a relatively universally accepted, blessful behavior, so to speak.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.400
It will, it will result in your, in the future well-being.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.840
And that's what it's meant when, you know, like, with the five precepts we spoke before,

03:23.840 --> 03:29.760
they would say, like, the Buddha would say, it would, it would provide you with confidence

03:29.760 --> 03:33.520
and you have nothing to fear, because you know, with these criteria that I'm upholding

03:33.520 --> 03:40.160
strictly for virtues, behavior, non-ill will, non-indulgence and so on, you start recognizing

03:40.160 --> 03:44.640
it good as they are, and then you see, yeah, this will most certainly be good for me even

03:44.640 --> 03:48.640
in the future, so you have confidence upon it, so then you don't have anxiety, right?

03:48.640 --> 03:49.640
Because why?

03:49.640 --> 03:52.680
Because you're not, not misbehaving.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.000
You have no, you're not giving in to anything unwholesome, so you, you feel protected with

03:57.000 --> 04:02.440
your own actions, and you can't ask for higher blessing than that, if the blessings

04:02.440 --> 04:06.240
would truly depend upon somebody else, which means you would always be the mercy of someone

04:06.240 --> 04:09.920
else as well, which would bring you back to the nature of your anxiety as it is right

04:09.920 --> 04:15.160
now, or you're not in control of you, or the mercy of elements, circumstances, accidents

04:15.160 --> 04:18.840
and what not, you're in mercy as something else.

04:18.840 --> 04:23.560
So if you want real blessing, is the blessing that you can make a difference, you can sort

04:23.560 --> 04:30.080
of have an input in, and that's the blessing that I'm talking about, of a virtuous behavior.

04:30.080 --> 04:34.240
And there is no nobody in between there, so nobody can take your credit away, nor can

04:34.240 --> 04:37.080
you blame anybody else if you don't do it, it's on you.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.720
No, you can take your blessing away.

04:38.720 --> 05:07.720
Exactly, exactly.
