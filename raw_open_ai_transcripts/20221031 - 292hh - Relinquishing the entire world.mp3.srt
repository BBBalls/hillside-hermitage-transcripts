1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What is an elinquishment in giving up?

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What do you need to give up? Why? What does it mean? Why is it necessary?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So what practically? What are the things you have to give up?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Did you actually step to trying to relinquish for sake?

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Trying to manage the suffering?

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, so if you're not trying to manage suffering but you still live with your spouse, children,

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
can you keep that and then give up management?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Can there be an arhat and light in the freedom of suffering?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Probably not.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So there are certain things you have to give up, give up.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So where is the line with the things you have to give up, give up?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Maybe you should try to understand what things you don't really need,

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or you can live without them and then...

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, that's a good idea.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Basically, do you evaluate what is necessary to have, what isn't, and then start there.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But obviously sometimes that can result, not that specifically,

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but people can have a view in regards to that whereby they think,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
okay, so if I give everything up, I'll be free.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So they don't use any discernment or reason to see where the line is

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and just start throwing everything away, so to speak.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And yeah, that might result in a very simple life, but fundamentally,

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
you cannot do that with your own body and your own senses,

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and that's where the problem is.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can't just discard like you can items that you possess.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So that needs to be understood while it is still there.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So while you still have it, you need to understand how you cannot have it really,

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
without destroying it, without blaming the eyes or ears for hearing or seeing and so on.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
People often think, if I like something, I should give it up.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So for example, if... I should give up my likes.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, whatever food is my preference, for example, I should stop eating that food.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is that a valid...? Is it? No.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Because that's not what the problem is.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The problem is not that something is agreeable to you,

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
because if things are...

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the problem is that you can't see the line between something being agreeable

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and you needing to have it and needing to keep it and wanting it,

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
or being enslaved by it, or being dependant on it.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So just because something is agreeable to you,

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that you have a preference for something doesn't mean you have to relinquish it.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What if you're emotionally attached to it?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're going to be miserable if you don't get what you like.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Should you give it up then?

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So sometimes I think yes, it can help,

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but then there's obviously a limit to that.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You can't give up all food just because you can't stop having some kind of desire in regard to food.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But would it be okay that somebody gives up only food that they like

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and only stuff that they don't like?

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Would that result in growing their mind?

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No. Why not?

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because it's still acting out of likes and dislikes.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Just denying, just doing the opposite.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Right, but they're not feeding their likes anymore.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They're not eating the stuff they like, the only stuff that they don't like.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, but they're acting out of the same thing.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Your preference?

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Just turning it the other way.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The preference towards the liking food?

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, the taste.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, sure.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And what else is a problem there?

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The belief that the problem is in the taste.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Exactly.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Your preference, your like, your emotional dependence was not in the taste.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So yes, there is a practical line there.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
As in, if you have no perspective, then maybe give it up.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't eat that, just to see whether your mind will be disturbed and how much.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But fundamentally, yes, that is not where the problem is.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The problem is in the desire and lust that's infecting your thoughts,

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
not the sense objects.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And that's where the uprooting, that's where the true relinquishment happens.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But in order to even kind of comprehend that direction,

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
yes, some practical physical relinquishment needs to be done,

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
needs to be actually performed.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So yeah, references.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course, the precepts, things you would give up through the precepts.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then further than that, yeah, you can, you know, everybody can get really inspired

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
with the idea of your still life and then just start throwing everything out.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But now that can become an issue.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You might be just acting out of a view that implies that problem was in these things,

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
not in my desire and lust on the mental level.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But if on the other hand you use some practical kind of reasoning,

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
as I will do, I really need this.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Can I live without it?

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Certainly it's better to be less cluttered.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Certainly it's better to go in the direction of relinquishment and simplification.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then fine, then if you decide that things can be dismissed,

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
given up, given away, that's all right.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But you still keep the perspective that the problem is actually fundamental

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
on the level of the mind taking up those things,

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the mind taking up the preferences with lust,

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
leaning towards them with lust, with aversion and so on.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What kind of relinquishment then?

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Because the sutta says basically that pretty much the prerequisite

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
for establishing your mind and dwelling in jhana is the complete relinquishment.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And even Satipatana, which is generally the practice of mindfulness,

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
presupposes overcoming happiness and concerns in regard to the entire world.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And then you can dwell mindfully.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So that's also a form of relinquishment.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
To what extent?

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I mean, I don't need to ask to what extent.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I just said it, the entire world.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But what would be the practical examples of giving up

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
an overcoming happiness and relinquishment in regard to the entire world?

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you keep the precepts, you're not engaging with centrality,

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but there is still obviously more to the world.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What are the other things you have to give up practically,

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
not just metaphorically,

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
in order to be able to surmount the world,

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to surmount the concern regarding the world,

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
in order to be able to dwell correctly, mindful,

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
in order to experience that vowsaga that suttas talk about,

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that then you are truly detached from the realm of thinking and pondering.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The mind is withdrawn from it, and that is the first jhana.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What are those things you have to give up?

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Obviously, core centrality, core seal will, chore, indulgency food, of course,

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and company, of course, but what else now?

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There is more to that, obviously.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Maybe it's indulgence and thought, I'd say,

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to put too much value on sort of arranging things.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you see that this ultimately is futile,

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I mean, recognizing that there is a kindrance.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You mean like arranging things on the level of the thought?

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Sort of controlling it or making it whatever?

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, sort of, yeah, quieting it.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, but see the problem with that could be that somebody can do that

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
before they got the right view.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So they are quieting their mind down with ignorance.

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So they still don't know the escape, but they start valuing the non-disturbance.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But seeking the practice is disturbing, but it's a good type of disturbance

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
because it can result in the right view,

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that can then result in complete liberation.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We spoke about it relatively often when somebody,

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and even the Buddha himself, said that the two types of thought,

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
like he would first realize how the problem is the unwholesome thoughts,

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
not thought in itself, then he put them into two categories.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Anything that's greed, aversion, delusion, he would not engage with,

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
a non-greed, non-version, delusion, he would allow.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And when greed, aversion, delusion present himself,

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
he would not try to get rid of it, get rid of it,

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
but he would just remind himself of the context, of the peril,

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
of the danger, of how little satisfaction,

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
how this is intending for his harm, for harm of others, for harm of all,

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
then those thoughts would subside on their own.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And that was his practice, and that was not peaceful.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That was still work, that was still burden,

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
obviously on the right level of enduring these thoughts,

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
pressuring you, not acting out,

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and then re-establishing the context in regard to them, until they subside.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When he fully developed that, completely,

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
sort of, when all he had was the good, non-greed, non-aversion, non-delusion,

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
he was still maintaining the context, and then he realized,

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
oh, but yeah, I don't need to do this now,

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
because these thoughts are not harmful.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So what if I just don't let them be?

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, and by the way, there was that difference in that Madhima Agama,

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
in that Sutta.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
In Pali, he doesn't really, he just goes into Second Jhana.

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But this explains how he was first intentionally involved

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
with maintaining the context and doing that Bhavana

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
in regard to the unwholesome states, until they subside.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Then after that, when he had wholesome states endure,

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
he realized, oh, I don't need to be intentionally involved

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
with this context constantly, because these thoughts are not contradicting it,

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
not going against it.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And then he, oh, what if I allow these thinking and pondering, basically, to be?

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And instead, just unify my mind internally on the basis of this wholesome environment

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that I have work for.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then he entered the first Jhana.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And then furthermore, then goes into Second.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So that was, like, missing step I was talking about,

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
that you wouldn't find in the Pali Sutta.

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So that's the point.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So, like, yes, you shouldn't be, or, like, you know,

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
if somebody is trying to control the thoughts and make any plan,

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
yeah, you've got to recognize that it's not going to lead to a solution.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But at the same time, thoughts are not a problem.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
First Jhana is thinking and pondering entirely.

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And it's the peaceful sublime abiding that's sufficient for Arahantship,

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
when the mind is totally withdrawn from it.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So the problem is whether those thoughts are alluding,

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
greater version delusion, distraction, cruelty, and so on.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And those are now subtle things that I was leading to

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
by asking what are the other less subtle things you need to give up

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
before you can start discerning these roots of your thoughts

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
in regard to the world.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So given the core sensuality is gone, you know,

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
cruelty, acting out of anger is gone.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What are the things that are not gone?

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's worldly gain, renown, status, position.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So basically kind of your relationship with others,

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
your ideas, the connections, comparisons.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Go on.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, I was going to suggest that it would then come down to the level of views,

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
relinquishing the dependence on,

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
well, what come down to different types of wrong views in regard to the world.

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So how would one practically relinquish views in regard to the world,

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
relinquish dependencies on the notions of others and so on?

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What do you practically need to do?

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Can you just start thinking about those things

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and relinquish them by figuring them out?

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Or you do need to increase that certain level of withdrawal from certain things.

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
In the same sense, precepts withdraw you from certain unwholesome behaviors

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
by body and speech.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, it seems to me that this desire for gain and renown and status and position

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
is all bound to the self view as well.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Like, you know, there's got to be a self image here, or a notion of self here,

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
which then, you know, will, and then there will be others

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and then there's this comparison, better, worse and all the rest of it.

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, that's all kind of the result of it.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But as I said, in order to come to that, which is a problem, what do you need to give up?

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Your household life.

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In a way, yeah, more specifically.

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Or the lightning company.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There you go.

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Basically, the lightning company, as in...

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But what does it mean to delight the company?

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, we can get to that as well, actually, because it doesn't just mean...

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Because people can think, oh, Buddha said seclusion, and I'm always in seclusion,

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
but the real reason is because I really have ill will towards everybody else.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And it's like, well, that's not the seclusion, because you're not secluded.

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The Buddha said the true seclusion, like the one dwells in company even when he's alone,

223
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
if his mind is not free from greed, ill will and delusion.

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So, yes, physical seclusion is necessary,

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
but the reason why you do it is even more necessary, more important.

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So, physical withdrawal, not seeking company, not finding delight in company,

227
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
kind of, yeah, that would diminish you referencing yourself from the point of view of company and others.

228
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're distracting yourself from the, again, point of view of company.

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What other things in regard to the world?

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Like this, how would you abandon concerns in regard to the world?

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What do you need to give up? What makes you concerned regarding the entire world and people and so on?

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So, we're talking about giving up central behaviour, ill will.

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay, what else do you do on the level of your senses with the world?

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
How are you engaging with the world?

235
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So, through company, what are the things?

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, I suppose, seeking information about it, seeking...

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Exactly.

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah.

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Engaging with the level of information, news, distraction, views on the level of ideals that pertain to regard to the world,

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the world, better place, all of that needs to be abandoned, just to begin Satipatana, rightly.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Because those are all factual concerns.

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They might not be apparent to somebody who is also, like, crowded with sensuality and household life and so on.

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Once you withdraw yourself from that, yeah, that's where the mind will revolve around.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Those are the underlying basis there.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And that's why, even like the...

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
When Buddha describes a monk, obviously, with the right view, he says,

247
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,000
a skilled monk, a noble disciple, abandoned, having been withdrawn physically from these sensuality, aversion, ill will,

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
he abandons thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of cruelty, thoughts of harming.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Then he abandons, like, they kind of concede a course.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Then he also abandons thoughts of his own, like, clanhood and homeland.

251
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And basically, on the level of, now, that's where your concede is, who you are in that broader sense.

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So, pretty much concerning, you know, that the level of the world as us humans, he abandons even those thoughts.

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Again, not by denying them, not by trying to get rid of them,

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but by, okay, I have those thoughts now and during in this mind.

255
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, let me establish the same context I was established for when he came to sensuality.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
These thoughts lead to more concede, more suffering, more burden.

257
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Whenever there is identity, where the traces of identity or full-blown identity,

258
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
dukkha will find the footing.

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Thus, by thinking these thoughts, I am not inclining this mind towards peace,

260
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I am inclining it towards harm, towards myself, towards others, towards everything else.

261
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And that's that, so you have to give up.

262
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And you wouldn't be able to give up these thoughts if you're still in company of others,

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
spending your time talking about politics and kings and worlds and ministers,

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
as the suitors would mention.

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, we have the present equivalent of that.

266
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Reading news, reading information, keeping in touch with happenings,

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
even if not necessarily, you know, political or something, but just in the world of science,

268
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
in the world of art, in the world of it, in the world of full stop,

269
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
means you still have certain connections to it internally.

270
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And that's truly where the problem is.

271
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And for as long as those things are not given up on their external level,

272
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
these thoughts will not be seen for what they are, the subtle ones.

273
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And even the duty towards the family.

274
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I mean, the whole point of the homeless life was leaving it all behind.

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So, like, you know, many monks would be kind of,

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but it's still, it's my duty towards family, my own family.

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's like, well, to that extent, you will not be abandoning thoughts of your clanshood

278
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and belonging and caste and wherever you come from,

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
because you are still taking on that external duty

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
through which you're maintaining this internal identity.

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It has to be, I am alone in this world

282
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
for which I have no more happiness nor concern.

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And the reason that you would have no more happiness or concern in regard to the world

284
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
is precisely because you would see also this, for example,

285
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you know, if you get bothered by, like, war going on in the world

286
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
or poverty going on in the world or things going on,

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
but you see what is the root cause of any of those things,

288
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
greed, aversion, delusion, for example.

289
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So if you're taking, if you see where that problem is rightly in yourself,

290
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you could not be concerned whatsoever with anything that goes on with the world.

291
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You're taking that seriously.

292
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That is why you are concerned with the world.

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Exactly, because you are not.

294
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Because of those things that are root of all these problems and concerns

295
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and seeking the safety and so on.

296
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So that needs to be relinquished as well.

297
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
There's that, obviously, mundane right view

298
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and that wrong view that says, there is no mother, there's no father,

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
no world, no next world, nothing.

300
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No next world, there's nothing, there's no given.

301
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You know, it doesn't really exist.

302
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
See, I'm not identified with any of those things.

303
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Thus, it's right.

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But that's actually the wrong.

305
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's upside down, yeah.

306
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There is mother, there is father, there is family.

307
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And you have overcome the concern in regard to it.

308
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You have denied it or got rid of them or threw them out

309
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
like you would throw your possessions.

310
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And that's the point.

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's what I mean, like, oh, so you can't throw out the world.

312
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You can't throw out your senses, or well, you can,

313
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
but you would still equally be bound by those domains, by those consciousness.

314
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You're not free.

315
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What you can do is overcome.

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That basis, for concern, for lust, for aversion, for this right,

317
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
for needing the safety, the basis, basically,

318
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
that's keeping you from your mind from being liberated from it.

319
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But as I said, it's roots are on the mental level,

320
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but in order to arrive at that, certain practical giving-ups need to be done.

321
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So, like refraining from seeking out information,

322
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
engaging, discussing these things.

323
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They're like, yeah, but I mean, I can, but there's no end to this.

324
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And there's, but there must be, why?

325
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because you feel insecure and unsafe.

326
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, does it come from the world, the lack of safety,

327
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
or does it come from a mind that's not liberated?

328
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You're making a choice there.

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you act towards the world, well, you got your answer.

330
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You might claim that you are still practicing for liberation.

331
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You're not.

332
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You had a crossroads and you perpetually keep choosing back onto the world.

333
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And that's exactly how you would go beyond the central domain,

334
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
not by suppressing it so it doesn't come up anymore,

335
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
nor by literally you stepping out.

336
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So you see it over there and you see how safe you are,

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
because that thing cannot not, it can only be over there and you know that.

338
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's what it said, like in the first jhana,

339
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
the thoughts are assailed by perceptions of sensuality

340
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
that you basically withdrawn yourself from,

341
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
because that's kind of what's in front, but you are outside now.

342
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And sometimes there are concerns to it that being withdrawn

343
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
from all these talks and whatever may produce an impression on others

344
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
that you are avoiding them, that you are hostile to them maybe,

345
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and even in monastic environment as well.

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So basically you have to take it on as your responsibility.

347
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You have to accept it, because some people will probably see it that way.

348
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So you have to accept that, yeah, well that's,

349
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and see that's why people would keep in touch.

350
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, that's touch base.

351
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Let's just keep seeing and talking to each other every day

352
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
so we all see that we are all right,

353
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
because I mean we still might be all right,

354
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
but the fact that somebody is now withdrawn from it,

355
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
the mind starts thinking, what if they are not all right?

356
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What if they are upset with me?

357
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's like, well, yeah, there is no end to that proliferation.

358
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The only end to that proliferation is to recognize,

359
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
okay, well, have I done anything by body speech and mind to make them upset?

360
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
No? Then okay, then this mind that's trying to make me go back there

361
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to make sure nobody is upset with me,

362
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I will restrain, I will re-establish context in regard to it

363
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
until those thoughts subside.

364
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
All if upon reviewing you're like, oh yeah, no, I did act a bit like this

365
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
like that, well, then go and apologize, sort it out.

366
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But still, do not use whether you feel good or bad as a criteria

367
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
whether you should act, but actually use your reflection

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and see whether there was anything done by body speech towards them

369
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
to make them upset.

370
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
If not, then you've got to endure the irrational mind

371
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that's trying to get you out of the solitude

372
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and seek safety in your tribe.

373
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And that is the thoughts of, oh, what will my peers,

374
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
what will my clan, what is my family,

375
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
what does my brothers think of me?

376
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Those are the factual concerns.

377
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's not like these random kind of abstract thoughts

378
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that a skilled monk would have.

379
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No, it's like on the level of sensuality and ill will,

380
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
that now you abandoned, well, what took their place

381
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
are thoughts about who you are, who you were,

382
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
how others see you, your past,

383
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
it's going to have that same weight.

384
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And now you practice that right context in regard to it,

385
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
which means it's not always going to feel pleasant

386
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
in the same sense, practicing the context against the,

387
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
you know, I don't know, sensual pull

388
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
or acting out of a version won't feel pleasant.

389
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's also quite directly related to being unable

390
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
to see wholesome as wholesome and unwholesome as unwholesome

391
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
because measuring yourself, what I should do

392
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
or what I shouldn't do, did I act wrongly or not,

393
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
on the level of, what will my clan,

394
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
the people I admire, the people I whatever,

395
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
what will they think of me, is basically,

396
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
in the beginning you might need to use the advice

397
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
of wise people to send you in a good direction,

398
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
but at some point you need to be able to discern

399
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
for yourself what is acting wholesome,

400
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
what is acting unwholesome, and not depend on basically

401
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and when you do those thoughts will still come.

402
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Because that's what the mind does.

403
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It still has the habits rooted in those subtler forms

404
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
of lasting aversion.

405
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But yeah, if you have the right reference,

406
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
you won't be acting out of how those thoughts make you feel.

407
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You won't be acting out of doubt, in other words.

408
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You would know whether to know, I'll go ahead and do this

409
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and re-establish the context until subside on its own,

410
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
subsides on its own, or, oh yeah, no, okay,

411
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I should actually make some effort externally

412
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
to sort the issues I created,

413
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and then go back to this either way.

414
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I remember one discussion with Monk about it,

415
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and well, basically he was referring to the Buddha himself,

416
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
talking, having small talks basically,

417
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
when somebody comes to him and they exchange some greeting.

418
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, pleasantries and stuff.

419
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah, pleasant talks.

420
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So how to understand, where is the limit to it?

421
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The reason behind.

422
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
See, they came and started small talk for the other purpose,

423
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
so it's like a way of expressing sort of friendliness,

424
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
and then it would go into a point.

425
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So he wouldn't have a small talk for the sake of distraction,

426
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
for the sake of non-perspective,

427
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
for the sake of greed or aversion.

428
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He wouldn't have the small talk for the sake of carelessness.

429
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So yeah, that's what it is.

430
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Maybe one can say that well,

431
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
as long as one sees that these talks really produce some...

432
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
One main thing is that as long as one realises one is not the Buddha,

433
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
not even an arahan, one will not understand

434
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
how can an arahan have a small talk.

435
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So until then, maybe take the small talk seriously in that sense,

436
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
do it only like as I said, as a way of relating to others,

437
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
but not more, not less, not make a big deal out of it either.

438
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm going to stop talking to me and get angry with everyone

439
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
who says good morning to you or something.

440
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But fundamentally recognise, yeah, I don't know where the line is,

441
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
because if I did, I would have the right view

442
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and be on the verge of arahantship and so on.

443
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And when I am, then I'll figure out how can the Buddha speak

444
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
with kings about seemingly pointless stuff.

445
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So there is that order of things.

446
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So could the cruelty and being that as long as I know

447
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
that this sort of talks is sort of unwholesome to me at least,

448
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I should refrain from them.

449
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
If you know what unwholesome is, like not like all,

450
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't like this, that doesn't necessarily mean it's unwholesome.

451
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No, I mean, I say producing all these concerns and I mean,

452
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
there are some, I say, innocent talk about politics.

453
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I know that you are stepping in.

454
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, and then...

455
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I think that's an oxymoron.

456
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
No, no, sure, yeah, of course.

457
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Like if I don't want my mind going there,

458
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
yeah, you don't have to talk to it.

459
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And if people keep insisting, then you basically stop associating with them.

460
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's as simple as that.

461
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Because yeah, you know, just general household life,

462
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
that those are the factual, real life concerns

463
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and they should not pertain.

464
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's why, like even in the suttas, you know,

465
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
when monks would sort of put each other down,

466
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
they would say like, ah, you can't take him seriously.

467
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
He's intimate with householders.

468
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He has householders for his friends.

469
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Means he's not a proper monk.

470
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
That's all he took.

471
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Having householders is your friends.

472
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Because you kind of share their concerns by implication.

473
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But then there were cases of other hands having householders for their friends.

474
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So in and of itself, as I said, that's not where the root of the problem is.

475
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But most practically, for most people,

476
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
yeah, that has to be restrained until you actually approve it.

477
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And then to what extent you'll engage in those talks afterwards,

478
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
you'll see, but it won't be done for the sake of distraction or whatever else.

479
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Or out of sea.

480
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like, I don't really care about the politics,

481
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
but I care what others think about me.

482
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And now they want to talk politics.

483
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And if I don't think bad about me, so I'll talk politics or whatever they want to talk.

484
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Well, that's equally unwholesome.

485
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So I'm acting out of that weakness.

486
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
No, I need to take on the weight.

487
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, they might talk badly about me behind my back.

488
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That's fine.

489
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And that's part of relinquishing my concern, my conceit defined by others.

490
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's not going to be pleasant because it was something you accrued and lived by.

491
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So it's who you are, pretty much.
