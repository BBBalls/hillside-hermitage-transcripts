00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Well, the thing was, what is choice?

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
I was going to say, what chooses, why do I tend to this site?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Why is there a tension to it?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Well, that's the same, asking why, it's the same type of question.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
I thought you just, you know, in regard to the licenses.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Why, and who chooses and stuff, all those assumptions placed in the faith,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
do you confuse them in regard to choice?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Because there is choice.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
There is choice.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
There is a tension.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
There is a tension.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
And there is intention in regards to you.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
If I take it, if I sit by, if I'm aware of myself,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
plus I'm seeing intention,

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
thoughts, thinking about, I'm going to do this, do that.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
And I'm also seeing what I'm attending to,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
when I'm seeing intention.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
That's also the better practice to see that.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Well, it is, but it's separate things.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Most likely that, which you think yourself is in that setup,

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
won't be really yourself.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
It would be your idea for yourself was,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
if the time you thought of it.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Because yourself, that's what we meant before.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
If you are able to choose, will, intend,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
without inducing sense of iron,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
through that choice, will, or intention,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
well, you'll be an online, or, on the way, to be one.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Which is why, again, mindfulness,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
of breathing on a punasati, is told to sort upon us.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Nobody shorter than that can really understand it,

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
and do it properly.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
But if there is a right view,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
then bringing that sense of,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I am choosing, I am willing,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I am doing like this, I am doing like that,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
makes you include yourself always,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
and not exclude, and make it kind of,

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
disappear in the background.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
So then, that mindfulness,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
and that discernment, applies to it.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
So what you want to do,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
you can't just directly start seeing yourself choosing,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
because yourself will step outside of that,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
and take it as yours.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
In other words, you won't be a sense of self,

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
if you think that's what.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So what you want to do is,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
recognizing the inevitability of the choice,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
you have to go the indirect way,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
realize that, well,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
you can but not choose,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
and whatever you do,

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
that's choice.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So you're actually not free,

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
in regard to choice.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
You might be free to choose what you want,

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
particularly,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
but you're not free to not choose at all.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
So in that recommendation,

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
that's what it contains,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
the understanding that,

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
even the most volitional act and choice,

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
cannot be actually taken as yours.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Because they fully depend upon it.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Well, they're given beforehand,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
as the actual thing,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
as the possibilities.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
You can't choose something

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
out of nothingness.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
It's only that implicit.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Even if it's a Reynolds spontaneous act,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
it's implicit as such,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
and that's why you could have attended it

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
and choose to do it.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Choosing to do it.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
So indirectly,

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
you have to kind of hollow it out,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
so to speak,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
until the thing is not being fed anymore

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
through the false assumption,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
to the right assumption of,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I am choosing this.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And then, yet, the choice remains,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
the preferences remain,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
but they're not being fed anymore,

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
and they don't spread,

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
they don't proliferate,

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
three minutes.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
So it's like a palm stump.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
You destroy the roots.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
You're not modifying choices,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
you're not trimming the branches,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
like, garnishing the tree or whatever else.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
No, you recognize the problem is in the roots.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
They are feeding this whole proliferation of their tree.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
So you kill the roots.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And then, whatever,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
whichever way it evolves and grows,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
it stays,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
and the point is,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
it won't go further.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
It doesn't matter how it stays.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Which is why our arms can still have habits and stuff like that.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
External habits.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
But now we're being fueled

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
and fed through the roots

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
and free the very illusion.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So when you're fully aware,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Markful of your body again.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
If you're mindful of the body

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
as a thing out there in the world

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
because of which your whole experience

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
recognizes,

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
and any choice you make,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
without actually making any specific choice,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
is then included in that.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
You realize that,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
without fire or awareness of mindfulness,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
it will always remain determined

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
by this living body out there.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Because if the body is dead,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
this cannot stand.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
And that already includes the nature

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
of the choice within that.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
So you have to stop like that.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
When that view gets established,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
then you have to kind of go within that

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
and clear out all of the residues inside.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
But first you have to start from the outside,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
which is why it's sort of when it still has conceit

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
and so on that he needs to kind of purify later.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
But he doesn't have that general

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
fundamental wrong view.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
So the starting point is that,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
seeing that with general awareness.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
To general experience,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
the experiences are all seen determined by the body.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
In the same sense,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
as we spoke before, the dead body

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
would not be even discernible as such

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
if there is no general experience

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
and consciousness in regard to it.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
So it's not that just everything stands upon the body

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and their bodies are living in the world,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
independent.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
That body, other in the world,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
is actually determined by this mind

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
that depends upon the dead body.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
But, you know,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
looks and puts on this.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
It's now a rupamian,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
but as I said before,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
it's that matter out in the world

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
with the consciousness out there,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
with that matter

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
that your experience exists as such,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
consciousness is not in your head,

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
it's equally external out there.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
But the consciousness is out there.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Where matter is in matter.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So you discern consciousness

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
based on where matter is discerned to be,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
because that actual matter is inaccessible.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
As I said before,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
when you think of the four elements,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
well, that's your thought.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
It stands for that which four elements is.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
If it actually stands for

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
what the nature of the four great elements is,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
means you're not conceiving them,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
that thought is the correct thought,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
thus you have understood,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
thus they don't find the footing

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
in your experience anymore,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
so you can say the four great elements

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
have ceased in an hour and a half.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
But if your thought,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
the presentation or the Dharma

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
of phenomena where you want to call it,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
stands for something

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
that's assumed to be matter.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
In other words, stands wrongly,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
misrepresent that which is matter.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
That means,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
are you have conceived it?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You have conceived the matter.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
The matter found footing,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and that's why the whole world exists for you.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Which is more party answered.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
No, but knowing that whatever I think

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
is only a thought.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Well, yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
No, that matter is unthinkable.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Knowing that which you think is only a thought

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
and the matter is unthinkable,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
and knowing that also is a thought

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
that doesn't stand for that matter.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
And that matter,

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
that I just said,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
is also a thought.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
So any possibility

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
and more and more peripheral

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
of the peripheral thought

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
in regard to your current thought

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
or in regard to your current thought

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
in regard to your earlier,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
doesn't stand for that matter anymore.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Not just actual thought,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
but the whole peripheral thought

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
doesn't represent it either.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Then you can say,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
you've fully approved your buildings.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
You don't conceive of an initial form

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
far near directing.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Anyhow.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I can agree.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
But then, say, well,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
so it's only my head.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Well, would that, again?

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Okay, sure. In a way it is all in your head, but would your head be there?

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
If you are not discerning it, if you are not thinking of it as my head, you wouldn't.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
And then your reckon as well, would it be even able to think any of that?

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
If this body, this material body out there is not living and breathing, you wouldn't.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
So then, yeah, it's all in your head, for as long as your body is alive.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
The body is destroyed, the matter is taken away. There is no more head.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
There is no more mind. So I reckon as well, actually, my mind, the experience as a whole,

09:26.000 --> 09:34.000
not image-generally mental, whatever, doesn't, it doesn't actually, it's not independent.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
So, and that's usually about statement, it's all in my head, implies.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
Me and everything else, kind of basically, I am the most fundamental.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
But if you recognize, sure, I am most important mental, and then you take that thought

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
and recognize it as determined by the fact that matter is there inaccessible.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
But you know, you can know that, because if something happens to that matter, everything is gone.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
And you can know that, and you know that.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
So knowing that long enough, will bring further recognition, and then, even if you have a thought

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
it's all in my head, you don't take that as me and mine.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Because you know that's a permanent.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Oh, everything is thought, yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
And the thought, the nature of thought, is able to manifest itself because matter is there present alive.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
That gets destroyed, which is another thought.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
So, but that's another thought in regard to matter that's present alive, while I'm still alive,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
which is another thought, which is another thought, which, and yeah, it's infinite.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
There is one, because you can never reach a matter.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
But through that infinity, if you want to pursue it or not, you can know, okay,

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm able to go in this any infinite direction, for as long as that which is matter stays.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
If that which is matter gets destroyed, the only thing that is gone, which is what I meant.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
When I said, how am I going to put it?

11:01.000 --> 11:08.000
When eternal, infinite is not confused with permanent and self.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Because infinite, it's like eternity.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
You can go forever, for as long as the matter stands.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
The matter is removed, the whole of the matter is gone, inconceivable.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
Let's put myself to come back to compensate myself.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Well, in a way you do, which is why it has to be taken on artificially,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
like a graph, as in a bit I said, the right view.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
And then if you do long enough, because, or if, you took it right me,

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
and if it corresponds to the way things actually are, then yeah,

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
it will take, it will take the proper root, and then you can see it for yourself as being it confirmed.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
But you won't see it naturally, because I mean you can find your own way out of ignorance.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
That's why it's taken right conviction, that's right view.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
But there is the assumption in every protrusion in different degrees,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
that things will happen naturally.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
You practice, and then you feel this thing unraveling.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Like, oh, it happened, I got it, or now it's clear.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
Those are kind of very general descriptions, but they usually take it to the wrong thing.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
You want it to happen, you want enlightenment to be found,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
and then it's all an easy ride afterwards.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
No, you need to convince yourself.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I said, well, it's not real, if I convince myself.

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
Well, what makes you think that your criteria, what's real, what's not real, is correct.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
What protrusion I think is real is itself.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
So you might not go so cruelly, and think, oh, I am, I'm in town, or whatever,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
but still, for as long as you know, it's protrusion of the human.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
You think, this is real, that's not real.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Means, this is more important, that's less important.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Means, I don't actually know, important, that's important,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
unimportant, is unimportant.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Which is why there was a sort of another verse,

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
says, knowing, important, is important, unimportant, is unimportant.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Getting that criteria.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
And you get criteria, if you convince yourself, to such an extent,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
the recognition takes place.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
So, yeah, there is a form of natural, unveiling, then, but not before.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Which is why, as I said, the Buddha will always make such exclamations,

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
like a warrior who won by himself,

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
I've done this, like whatever was to be achieved by my manly effort,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
but my, I've done it.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Nobody else had any input.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
No luck, no circumstances.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I've made the effort, and I got it.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
I worked through this conviction, until I've seen it.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And now I'm sure.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I had faith that the conviction was right, so I was convincing myself.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Now I've seen it, and it's right, I don't need to convince myself anymore.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And I certainly don't have faith.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I have confidence, because I know that it's right.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Sounds insane.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Sounds fundamentalist. Sounds like mad.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Which is exactly how Buddha saw it in the first time,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
when he met the ascetic.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
He says, I am self-in-lightened.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Nobody, I absolutely know the teacher.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I'm the greatest, I'm this, I'm that.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
And this was a so big friend, and walked off.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Because he was all true.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
Well, he said, but obviously, then he realized, well, he found to teach.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
I need to find a slightly more relatable approach,

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
that will not induce kind of resistance in people.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Thinking you're all conceit, but it's all fact.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
So do I.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
That what we had on the monument in Skraj.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I've gone beyond the widows of the river.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I'm my own guide.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Cannot be, cannot be guided.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Not even I don't want to.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
It's impossible for me to be guided by another.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
It's that level.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Oh, that's just fundamentalist.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
That's just wrong.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
That's just fixed view.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Every views are fixed view.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
You want to get the right fix.

15:20.000 --> 15:34.000
So I want to make sure that your convictions are correct,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
for as correct as they can be.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
So you really want to emphasize the discernment, reasoning, reflection.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Because as you can see, you don't really know what you're convincing yourself,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
whether it's right or wrong.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
If it's right, you recognize it.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That's right.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
You try to respond to the right things and then you'll see through it.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
But if it ain't, it means you're going to wind yourself further and further and further into ignorance.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
So yeah, it's a very risky thing.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
But you're ignorant anyway.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
So not trying it is even more foolish,

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
than at least attempting to break out.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
It could be a lot of faith to commit the view of our world.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't hold many fixed views.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Well, that's a fixed view for you.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
They should have fused responsibility for it.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
And that's even worse.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah, the point is that freedom comes off from it.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
There is a...

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
That's what you can do.

16:45.000 --> 16:53.000
A form of measuring, once you start practicing, yeah.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
There are some tokens and little hints that can be,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
okay, I might be on the right way.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
And that's why they wouldn't explain the four stages and the fetters that have been through reviewing those.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
You get the pointers.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Oh, I might flee from doubt.

17:11.000 --> 17:18.000
I would be free from self-view, I would be free from holding onto virtue and duty.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Keep reviewing that.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Understanding what those are means.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
You'll be free from that.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
For us, it's keeping in light of those things that are causing suffering.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
Well, no, holding onto the self-use, what causes suffering,

17:35.000 --> 17:44.000
well, it makes your mind able to suffer in good ways, trying it.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
But you wouldn't be able to say, well,

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
you're kind of trying to practice, look at these things, look at these things.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
And then one day, as well, I am...

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Is it working?

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
Well, I'm happy enough.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I'm happier than I was.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Yeah, but are you a centre-party?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I don't know, but I'm happier.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Well, exactly.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
Which means you settled for less, or basically settled for nothing.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Because you would know.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
It's like what is.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Basically, putugina is in a trend that's about the crash,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
and centre-party thinks you are to the crash called together.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Which you just refer to, well, I'm happier,

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
means you just got upgraded in a fancy compartment.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That's still going to crash.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
So ultimately, it actually makes no difference.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Which you want to be is out of that training.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
That's the way you would know it.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Is that something you would know exactly?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Because if you have doubt in regard to it, it means up, you know, free from doubt.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Which means that you definitely, not free from that factor,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
which means you cannot be a sort of fan.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Obviously, so you can get people who get so convinced themselves,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
but it's easy to under that.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
You know, you would see the need.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Like, you know, I understood just a challenge of you or two of theirs,

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
and you'll see the need to maintain the grip on the view.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Because it's existential dependence.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
But then you can't really do much for them,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
because if they were able to convince themselves

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
to let extent to believe something that they're not,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
it means they're deeply rooted into bad faith.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
And the authenticity has to be the first point.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
You really want to do it for yourself,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
and completely, like, nobody else.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Really, for me, concerning only me.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
So, lying to yourself, just so that others will recognize themselves,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
or lying to yourself through the others by others,

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
or, oh, yeah, yeah, like, that's a security in that they're the basic one,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
and you will know what you're doing.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
And if you're honest in that level, you wouldn't do it.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Suffering and freedom from it.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
That's the goal, that's the criteria, that's the measurement.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Nothing else is accepted as compromise.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
I told you that when I was back in Serbia,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
and then, you know, you go on,

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
you get all sorts of Buddhist books and texts or whatever else.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I was reading everything.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And I came across, and then, you know,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
sort of by my sacrilegomy and contemplating all that.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
And then I came across this eye, came article,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
where she says, about sort of the party.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Oh, great.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Because I was just looking for anyone's input.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
I wanted to learn more, I think it was before, actually,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
yeah, way before I came across Nihirah.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
And she said,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
oh, we are basically, we are already sort of partners.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
That's great, very fortunate.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
And my first of all was, wow, I'm sort of a partner name.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
So I continue reading, and she says,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
she explains how we're sort of partners.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, basically, we all know the power into the shrines

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
and stages in English.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So we are all free from rights and rituals.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Are we? Yeah, yeah.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Show hands, we are.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Then we all know that

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
that the Buddha was right.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So we have no doubt in regards to his teaching,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
he is up to you to accept it.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah, we're free from doubt.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
And we all know that self doesn't really exist.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Modern science is proven, the molecules are constantly changing.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
There is no substance to it.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yep.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Yep, we agree.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
So we are all sort of partners.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And they're thinking, okay, I'm a sort of partner.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
And then immediately, next thought, well,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
what difference does he make?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
If that's what sort of a body is,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
what difference does that make?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't care.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Because I wasn't concerned about becoming a sort of partner

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
or whatever, I was concerned about being suffering

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and free and fluid.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
So, sure, you can have the whole Buddhist world

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
recognize you as a sort of partner.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
If you are eternally not free from suffering,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
it's irrelevant.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Unless you were never actually about free and fluid suffering,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
but you were about to recognition.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
You felt lonely, you felt inadequate,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
you never loved you or whatever else.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
But you have to be honest with yourself

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
and practice for the right reasons.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
That's what Buddha said.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
The downer own has only one taste,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
same like the sea, has the taste of salt.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Downer has the taste of freedom from suffering.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
That's it.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Can't do it for any other reason.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And why would you?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
So, that's exactly the thing.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Oh, well, yeah, okay.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
According to this, I'm an oven.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
What difference does he make?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
I'm not free from suffering.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
That's what my concern is.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
And that's what my athletes are applied to.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
But then, obviously, you did what Buddha said.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
And so, the one is the one who is free from suffering

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
to a great deal,

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
and those that we see are from pro-number shoots,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and we're just up, I can run.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
And then, okay, so if she was wrong,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
it means that the views that she used

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
to describe these three factors are also wrong,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
which means, okay,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
so what does really freedom from virtue and duty mean?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Because, clearly,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
if what I think it means,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
unless that thought makes me so different,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
it makes me so different, and it means that thought is wrong.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
So, that's what I meant when I said,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
by understanding what the factors are,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
you abandon them.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
There is no discrepancy, there is no delay.

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
So, would you say that freedom, virtue and duty?

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Well, for as long as you think,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
did your good virtue

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and sense of duty,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
I'm a monk, I need to meditate, I need to do this.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Any, like the nature of duty,

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
the nature of virtue,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
as long as you think,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
as long as you hold that

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
to pertain to the practice,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
means you're holding on to it.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Because Dhamma is completely different from that.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
There is no wrongful virtue, Dhamma.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
There is no Dhamma without virtue,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
but virtue is not the Dhamma.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
As they said,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
when they were saying,

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
what should we recite first?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Story is concerning sealer,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
or the story is concerning the Dhamma.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
He said, well,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
there is no Dhamma without sealer.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
So, let's recite that first,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and then they decided that the sutra

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
to be regarded.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
But, they knew the Dhamma is not that.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
So,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
it's almost,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
well, what does that mean?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
I can go and do everything.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
No.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
You can't do everything

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
which you want,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
also, and also, because

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
saying that Dhamma is not virtue,

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
is not like saying Dhamma is

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
un-virtual.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Is that a word?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Un-virtual?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Un-virtuals.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Un-virtuals.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Can you say that?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Anyway, you get it.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Because that's people's assumption.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Good means Dhamma.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
But if you say, no,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
there is no wrongful good in Dhamma.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
So, Dhamma is bad.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
No, there is no wrongful bad either.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
So, that's what means

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
dropping,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
thinking about Dhamma.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
People usually translate it

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
as rights and rituals.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
You can place it down.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Dhamma makes you

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
enables you to relate to it.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Oh, yeah.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Bowing to a shrine doesn't mean anything.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
It's much softer than that.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Why?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Because if stopping,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
if not bowing to a shrine,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
is required to bend in the fetter well,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
most of the monks, well,

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
many more would have been so advanced.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
But it's softer than that.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
It's actually

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
silver,

25:34.000 --> 25:34.000
butter,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
paramasa.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
It's silver.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
It's the same word.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
It's not a bit from me.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
It means virtue.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Virtue and duty.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
It feels, again,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
with trying to purify.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
But there is no Dhamma without virtue in Dhamma.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Dhamma is not virtue in Dhamma.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
But you have to restrain yourself.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Have to restrain yourself first,

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
and then you might say,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
when you see it,

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
you'll see that it's not very strange.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
It's not very strange either.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Because you can never,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
if you're just straining,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
you'll always be restraining yourself, right?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Because it's not pointed.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
What is there?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Well, you're straining so much

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
where you can never,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
you're so virtuous,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
you don't think anything

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
planned there.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
And that will,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
that won't result in Dhamma.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
But won't you?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
That's the thing.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Because people think

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
if I'm just virtuous enough,

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
I'll see the Dhamma.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Not necessarily.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
It's a basis.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
But if you don't pull anything

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
on the basis,

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
it remains just a basis.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
So what's your

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
and restrain yourself

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
like a raft?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
So if you don't use the raft,

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
it doesn't mean anything.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Yeah, I suppose, yeah.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
I mean, it came like,

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
what I think I said that before.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
It's like a fertile field.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
But if you don't pull any seeds,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
it's just a fertile field.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
You can't expect,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
you know,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
wrapping the fruit.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
There isn't any,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
because you haven't planted it.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
But then eating the fruit,

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
yeah, you wouldn't be there

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
without the field.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
But it's certain.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
You're not the soil and the field

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
and the field,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
because you're eating

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
one little bit of the thing.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
There wouldn't be there

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
without the field,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
but it's clearly not the field.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
How long does it take

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
to become virtuous enough?

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
As long as necessary.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Like some people

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
can do it, you know,

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
you know, in half a night.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
So people, like, again,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
some people can do it just after speaking

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
with Buddha for a while.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
The mind will be virtuous enough

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
for them to get a right view.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
But that's because

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
they would have the right

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
destruction

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
without any kind of

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
frequency and notions

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
obstructing it.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
It's a virtue not to just be straight.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Well, the restraint

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
is supposed to bring the state of mind.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Which is the virtue of state of mind.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Virtues and like,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
like, behavior and attitude.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
It's like a recognition.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh, it's, I've been engaging

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
in the virtue of behavior.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
It's a recognition.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
So it does take some time.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
So you can get, yeah.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
So as I said,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
some people can get established

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
upon that recognition quickly,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
upon one virtuous act.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Some people need more.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Today I think most people need

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
much more.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Much more time.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah, much more of virtuous acts

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
in order to get the recognition

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
of a phenomenon of virtue

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
that you're established upon.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
But then if you do practice

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
something that goes

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
in a completely different direction,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
because if you were and means

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
you could do the dharma,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
means there would be

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
a set of prescribed,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
rights, rituals, duties,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
methods, techniques,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
with personal retreats

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
that could lead you to dharma.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
A mere performance,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
mechanical performance,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
or something could lead you

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
to the dharma,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
but it can't.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Because dharma doesn't pretend to

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
it.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
So,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
whatever.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
It just,

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
why does virtue,

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
why does virtue have to

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
be the baseline?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Why not?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Why is it relevant?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Why is virtue relevant?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
So, is that question relevant?

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Anyway, I can answer it.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Back onto the similarly

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
of going out on the motorway

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
in a pursuering of senses,

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
in exposing yourself

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
to accidents

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
or a chopping block

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
or whatever else.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Same note to it,

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
by default.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Is it better than saying yes?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
If there is a danger

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
involved in it?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Yes.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
So, it's better to say no.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It's better to restrain.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
That's why virtue is better.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Because you don't know why,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
but through doing it,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
it prevents,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
but it prevents the more immediate

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
demise.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Well, you know this trouble

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
in that regard you get this.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
If you don't restrain yourself.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Yeah.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Things that could happen.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
But it goes,

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
it doesn't just concern the

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
bodily behavior of those who

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
end to the mind.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
It works for the mind.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
It's just subtler,

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
but it's the same principle.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
By letting mind go

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
onto the domain that doesn't own,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
you're taken by it.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
By saying no,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
it means you remain out of it.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
By remaining out of it,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
it means you can see it eventually.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Not if you're engaged.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
That's what Buddha made me say.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
There is no,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
it's impossible to engage

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
in a central act without

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
having your mind being taken

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
by those central perceptions.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
You can't,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
or I'm free from

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
sensuality yet,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I'm doing central acts.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Basically,

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
it's impossible.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
You just cannot,

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
cannot occur.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
So that's why.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
The person who is not

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
virtuous,

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
means their minds,

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
their mind are assumed

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
in those domains.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
They can't get a perspective

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
on it if he is in it.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
It's really not jealous.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Oh, no.

31:05.000 --> 31:28.000
There's no question of that.

31:28.000 --> 31:35.000
Then,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
abandoning self identity.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Is that just,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
you have to see self?

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
Yes, it is the first thing.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
So when your general behaviour

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
is not engaging in things

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
that are compromising

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
the perspective

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
on your general behaviour,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
you can start seeing that,

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
well,

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
simultaneous kind of determination

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
or rather dependence

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
of your general behaviour

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
upon this random body.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
But while you engage

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
in random body attacks

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
with last version delusion

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
without any mindfulness,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
you can't see anything.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Your audio attention is.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Yes.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Basically, you sink

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
into a hole,

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
and you can't expect to kind of

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
maintain the vision

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
of the whole lifestyle.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It's just, you can't.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
So by restraining first,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
in order to get the perspective,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
you get the perspective.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
Then you see the place of restraint.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
You see the place of duty,

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
which means you don't

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
hold onto it,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
blinded anymore,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
which means you're free.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
You can see about it,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
but not so.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
And then, you don't have to

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
be restraining that.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
But you will,

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
because that's now

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
the established normal behaviour.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
And also,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
because you recognise

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
it's more

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
less hassle,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
and more pleasant

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
to be restrained.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Like, the joy of renunciation

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
replaces the joy of

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
essential indulgence.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
But it's again,

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
any further you have.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
You have to.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Here is our view

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
for that.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
You can't just

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
feel pure restraint.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
I mean, you can

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
keep telling yourself,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
but you won't take root

33:09.000 --> 33:16.000
because it's not enough.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
But if you get that general perspective,

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
you see that

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
whatever choice you make

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
made will make

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
your general experience,

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
your experience as a

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
hold is fully dependent

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
upon this random physical body

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
right here,

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
right now,

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
that's the most

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
close to you.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
I mean, there's this body,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
there are these bodies.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
There's no difference

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
between them.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
There are bodies.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
In those bodies there,

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
internally, externally,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
externally, externally,

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
in bodies are there.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
It's just that this particular

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
body is closer

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
to the general experience as a hold,

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
determines it more

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
than these bodies.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
But none of it can be

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
mine to begin with.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
So getting that kind of

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
perspective

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
means good or bad,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
good and bad,

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
neutral,

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
both,

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
whatever,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
it's implemented

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
because it's within that,

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
cannot escape,

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
cannot spill or

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
cannot step outside.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
So it's completely different

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
than just doing good.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
It's absolutely nothing.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
You abandon good.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Inasmuch your abandon

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
bad.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
But in order to do so,

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
you need to be established

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
upon good.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
And why is it good?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Because at least,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
you don't know why,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
but by doing good,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
no bad means at least,

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
you're kind of

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
don't step into that domain

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
where you fully lose control,

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
fully lose perspective,

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
fully taking bad.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
You don't take the bad,

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
basically.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
That's why it's good.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Because it says,

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
no, you don't even know

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
that it's bad.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
But by adopting attitude

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
of saying no to it,

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
you don't take it.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
And later on,

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
you find out that

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
there is actually poison in it.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
As a simile,

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
I just switched to the

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
handless engine,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
that the poison is drink

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
in terms of the

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
essential pleasure.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Pleasant,

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
pleasing in every sense,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
side smell,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
texture and everything.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
But you know,

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
now that there is a poison to it.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Because in the beginning,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
why am I saying no to this?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
It's just pleasure.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
It's innocent.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
It's nice.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
It's beautiful.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Whatever else.

35:14.000 --> 35:14.000
The whole world does it.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Why do I have to say no?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
You don't know that.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Because if you would,

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
you'd be free from it.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
But you're taking a trust,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
it's better to say no.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
And you ask,

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
why is it better?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
And I say,

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
because you don't consume it.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Just,

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
you don't know why it's better

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
not to consume it.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Later on,

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
when you find out,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
you can find out only

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
because you haven't been consuming it.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
That's the effort that's very strange.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Afterwards, yes.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
After there is no restraint,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
it's understanding,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
which is why I cannot engage

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
in a sexual intercourse,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
or any central act.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
It's just inconceivable.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
He's not restraining himself,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
really kind of trying hard

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
and after doing it,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
and he can't even conceive to do it.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
So that's why it's better not to do it.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Then after,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
it becomes self-evident.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
That's sort of how it sees that.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
But he still is...

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Yeah, he sees that in a general,

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
in a fundamental level,

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
but in a more particular level,

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
he still has more details.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
He still has...

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Yeah.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
He can fall back into those things.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
To the extent that he can't fall back

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
to the point of having a wrong view

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
of afterward anymore.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
He can't,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
which is why he's at most seven rivers.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
But remember that sort of,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
sometimes it's the second one,

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
that's it,

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
or the third one, that's it.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Seven at most,

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
but not necessarily all seven.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
When it becomes upon landing,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
and all those different kind of slightly,

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
slightly ambiguous descriptions.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
See, it doesn't even get fully born as human.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
It's upon landing to be able,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
whatever it means,

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
he becomes...

37:03.000 --> 37:10.000
He becomes an island.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
So the violence abroad

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
doesn't need much to remember again.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Well, he might not...

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
He doesn't remember...

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
He might not remember particular things,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
but the principles,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
the potential of the nature of memory,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
are there.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And he just needs to be alive.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
And if he's not,

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
well, in the next life,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
and he's at most seven nights,

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
a lot of times,

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
and those principles,

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
we kind of see back into whatever understanding he has.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Well, the natural incline,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
is basically those principles,

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
are what he is.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
So, yeah,

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
it will inevitably,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
because that's the direction he is.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
So,

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
when he wants to do this,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
he'll be going that way,

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
eventually.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And no matter how,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
in doubt, he can get,

37:55.000 --> 38:02.000
and careless,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
it's all, like,

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
just nothing,

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
in comparison.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
He will arrive there.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
But, yeah?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
There is still some work to be done,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
so there's no excuse for not doing it.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Which is why the boy would be urging,

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Saikas,

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
to become an aunt,

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
says,

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
if there wouldn't be any work,

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
I wouldn't be telling him,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
going to the work,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
but because there is,

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
there's no need to do it.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
So,

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
the thing,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I'm going to show you,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
gaining perspective,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
that this general awareness,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
depends on this,

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
his particular body,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and then doing that,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
and then seeing that,

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
is it,

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
well, you,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
not entirely,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
if you're suffering,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
but there's a major shift,

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
you know,

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
it's longer,

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
it's subject to it,

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
something,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
then you have no doubt,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
if it goes

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
to what you've been doing,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
at the same time.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
You know,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
once it works,

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
so there's different,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
it's gone,

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
once it works.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
And then you can't even conceive,

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
and the idea of a pamiro,

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
existing,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
upon anywhere else,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
different,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
from your general experience,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
as a whole,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
depending upon this material,

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
organs,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
which is also part of general experience,

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
as a whole,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
as a form of designation,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
these organs.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Just like that,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
change where,

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
the general awareness,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
how is that happening?

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
That's just an attention

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
to the whole.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Well, it's not happening,

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
it's already there.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
You start back into it,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
you recognize it.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
The only reason you can reflect,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
is because there are,

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
the nature of reflection is possible.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
If there wouldn't be a place,

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
so,

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
it's not something else.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
It's not something,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
one, you do it,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
by intending to go

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
that direction,

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
but that direction exists,

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
that's what your experience is.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
So, general,

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
and particular,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
actual and peripheral,

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
peripheral,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
in general,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
that's already there.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
We're so used to being observed

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
in what's taking your attention,

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
actually, but now,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
directly,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
you don't see peripheral,

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
then you wonder,

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
how this peripheral comes,

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
no, that peripheral

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
is the basis for actual.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
And in the same sense,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
that peripheral is determined,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
but then, which is not peripheral,

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
it's peripheral to this.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
So, recognizing the phenomenon

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
of that peripheral means

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
developing mindfulness.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Like, let me how to see

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
without shifting

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
the original direction.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Let me how to see peripherally.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Because if I'm trying to do it,

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
that's it.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Well, if you try to do it,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
if you're intending,

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
or are they over intending

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
in this case,

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
means you just shift

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
onto the new actual,

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
which means now peripheral

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
is different,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
and you're not seeing it.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
So, you see it

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
in the garden,

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
what you're seeing,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
which is a form of seeing,

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
an indirect wear of seeing,

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
which is equally valid

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
where you're seeing.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
You just got so used,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
that staring directly,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
to that became the norm

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
of existence and reality.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
And if something is not there,

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
it doesn't exist.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
It's a real.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
In general awareness,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
you said that,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
what is another term for that word?

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
What do you mean?

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I can't say,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
do we have to flick mindfulness?

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
What does mindfulness

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
mean to we have to flick mindfulness?

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
In general awareness,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
we set what is the

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
another term for that word

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
which we mean?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
We have to flick mindfulness.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
We have to flick mindfulness.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
What do you mean?

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Like I say, we have to reflect mindfulness.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Mindfulness is present.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
So it's conscious.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Yeah, and that's right.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Mindfulness is established.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
And you don't establish it by going from the deep inside of your head or whatever else.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
You establish it by recognizing your general experience very well,

42:44.000 --> 42:50.000
and I will speak fully determined by this positioned matter of your body on that chair,

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
while we're speaking, while you're asking these questions.

42:53.000 --> 42:58.000
That body remains there seated, or whichever situation it's in.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
And you have no control over the material aspect of that.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
I mean, you have no control to such an extent that you can't even think matter.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
You can think in regard to that which matter is.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
And in that which you think the matter is in regard to which you're thinking,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
that's also a thought.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
That's how inaccessible elements are.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
And consciousness is out there with an equally inaccessible.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
And then you realize that whatever comes as a result of conscious matter,

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
namely feeling perception intentions are equally inaccessible.

43:33.000 --> 43:41.000
So my sense of myself, me, volition, intention, determination, and of mine,

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
inconceivable to be mine.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
Which is, remember we spoke about it a few days ago,

43:47.000 --> 43:54.000
and said, well, it's so fundamentally inconceivable that, as I said,

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
it's actually nothing to grieve over.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
It's impossible to even conceive an ocean of grief, sadness, over it.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
Which is why, in that rudiment of the Buddha said,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
there is the unborn, the un...

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
The unborn, the undetermined, the...

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
All of those, like, there is.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
And that's that inaccessible thing.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Because if there wouldn't be, mebana is inaccessible.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
It's real.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
In every experience, in experience of a Buddhist,

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
no Buddhist pathogen, I don't, mebana is there.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
It's just why it's fully understood or not.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
If there wouldn't be inaccessible, means access would be there.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
And freedom from it would not be possible.

44:41.000 --> 44:47.000
But because there is an inaccessible, freedom from anything that you could have access before is possible.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
And accessible is anything that appears.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
Means you can access it, you can take it, you can appropriate it.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
Hence, both age and death and so on.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
As a result of it.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
But if you fully understand that it's rooted

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
upon something you can't even think.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
And you know that, means you know what inaccessible is,

45:13.000 --> 45:22.000
without conceiving it in your thoughts.

45:22.000 --> 45:29.000
It's absolutely like no room for emotion, it's just inconceivable.

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
Which is why it doesn't feel anything.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And that's how as well.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
You can resolve upon that with wisdom long enough to become an event.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
Because if you keep that image long enough, correctly,

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
without conceiving it, all of the factors will fall away.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
Which is what sacred is supposed to do.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Not me, not mine, not I am.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Not ecstasy here, not ecstasy there.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
Not assuming ecstasy, not ecstasy there.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.000
That's what the element of nibbana, like nibbana dot, that's what it means.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
It's there as a possibility, as an element.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
It needs to be understood.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Yes, it needs to be understood.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
And that's why you can conceal it as well.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
And there's other symptoms.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
It says, he thinks, oh, I am nibbana, I am entering nibbana.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
That which he refers to is actually nibbana.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
But he's not entering it or attaining it because he's thinking, I am.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
He's conceiving it.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
So it's nothing magical, it's nothing hidden in that sense.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
Like, what you have is pathogen, it's five aggregates.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
What she has done, it's five aggregates.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
It's within that that the whole dumbbells can think.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
It basically pertains to the way you take them or not.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
The five aggregates.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
And you take them, for as long as you don't fully understand

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
that there is impossible to take them in the first place.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
They are inaccessible.

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
Not knowing they're inaccessible, you access them through that lack of knowledge.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
So there is no room for it, but it has always been there.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
So it's beginningless, but actually it's not supposed to be there.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
It's not needed, it's not necessary.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
It's a parasite, isn't it?

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
But beginningless.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
It's something you knew before, because if you knew before,

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
you couldn't have fallen onto this not knowing.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
Because once you know, you cannot not know anymore.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
So this lack of knowledge is beginningless yet completely exaggerated.

47:46.000 --> 48:11.000
Not knowing they're inaccessible, that's it.

48:11.000 --> 48:18.000
And with general mindfulness, we can begin to recognize the conducts are inaccessible.

48:18.000 --> 48:26.000
Well, you recognize that any thought, any notion, any thought, any designation,

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
no matter how subtle, how minimal, how general, how ambiguous,

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
you recognize it as such, but you recognize it as such.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
You don't take it to stand, you don't take it to access that which is inaccessible,

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
which is back onto the principle of meditation I was telling you about before,

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
whatever arises you included.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
You recognize it as such, and that's what I mean.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
When you say, ah, the matter is inaccessible, that thought of that inaccessible matter

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
is also your thought, which you then think that matter to be,

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
so that matter has access to you or you access the matter.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
So he conceives in matter, matter in me, I'm in matter, I'm in matter,

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
I'm right, he conceives matter.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
But if you know that matter is inaccessible, and then that thought doesn't stand for that which matter is,

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
and that thought that says that which matter is also doesn't stand for that which matter is,

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
and that design to it.

49:23.000 --> 49:30.000
So you leave that whole infinite kind of domain,

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
as well, sorry, you don't leave it, but you kind of understand that whole infinite domain

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
is basically inaccessible.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
It cannot access matter, matter cannot access it.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
No matter how far you go, what next thought comes,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
it cannot stand for that which matter is,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
because that's another thought of matter,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
it can stand for what matter is.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
So you realize whatever I think, quickly or slowly,

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
I'm bigurously, it will be under lower thought.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
Thus, that which matter is cannot manifest itself in my thought,

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
because what I think are my thoughts,

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
which is why, what I perceive in my perception, what I feel in my feelings,

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
I don't feel my thoughts, I don't perceive my feelings.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
That confusion means confusion in regard to the basic nature of phenomena.

50:15.000 --> 50:22.000
So it needs to be clarified to that point when what I'm saying now can make more sense.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
But if you think matter, you direct your matter, that's a thought.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
You recognize, no matter how far it goes,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
you recognize it within the domain of thought.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Next thought still shares the same nature of thought.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
And you get to understand that,

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
when you start concerning yourself with nature of things,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
as opposed to with particularity of things,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
so you don't care what you think your care of thought is there.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
You don't care what you see, your care of sight is there.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
You start recognizing the nature of things,

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
but being established in a nature of thought,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
nature of the thought domain,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
which is basically nature of everything,

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
means whatever you think will be seen in its nature,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
which means it will be seen in its rising,

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
seizing and persisting while changing for as long as it's persisting.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
But it will not be confused,

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
it will not be assumed to stand for that,

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
which is outside of the domain of thought.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
And even the thought outside of the domain of thought

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
cannot actually be outside of the domain of thought,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
because it's also not a thought.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
So you can't step outside of it, inconsirable.

51:27.000 --> 51:34.000
The world has been mindful of that nature of thought.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
You have to recognize it,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
you have to do it at the same time to see this.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Well, no, it rises on its own.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
You didn't create that thought.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
So if you recognize it to the extent which has a reason,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
you're not adding anything to it.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
There is no assumption to it,

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
you're not taking anything away from it.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
So that's why, by contemplating,

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
sort of not even the bodhisattva,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
previous Buddha we've passed before,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
he became the Buddha.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
While he was the bodhisattva,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
he recognized that, and then all he'd done

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
was contemplating arising,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
manifesting, arising, appearance,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
and disappearance,

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
persisting or changing in regard to five aggregates,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
things in their arising,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
things manifesting in their arising,

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
things manifesting in their seizing.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
And that's it.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
He'd done that long enough,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
he became some Samboda,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
and the same principle works for anybody

52:28.000 --> 52:34.000
who wants to become an Arant.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Because things do arise on their own.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
If they weren't,

52:37.000 --> 52:45.000
it means you would be the master.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
That's it.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
That's the fact.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
If you recognize feeling, I say that's just a thought.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Well, yeah, feeling is mental.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
But if you say that's just a thought,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
as opposed to what else?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
What else is not just a thought?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Even just a thought is just a thought.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Yes, well, I mean,

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
it's a thought.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Well, everything is a thought, that's a thought.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
So instead of that's just a thought,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
no, that's a thought.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Which means, mastering your thoughts,

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
you'll be an Arant.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
And finding out there is a suit that says it.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
But you don't master your abstract scholarly proliferation thoughts.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
You master the phenomenon of thoughts.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Because everything is mental in that sense.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
You wouldn't be able to discern anything

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
if it doesn't kind of pertain to your mind.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
You might come from different directions,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
but that's where you know it.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
You just couldn't.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
So feeling is mental.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
So you say whatever...

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Well, mental means...

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Mental means it's a phenomenon.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
It's a phenomenon.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
That's what my mind is.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
The domain of the phenomenon is what chiptages.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
And when the Buddha asks,

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
well, what are those dummies?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I think it's the Father like it.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
What else can it be?

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
What are those circumstances?

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
It's the Father like it.

54:06.000 --> 54:24.000
What else can it be?

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
So if you use thought to describe your discursive thinking proliferation,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
then you shouldn't use the same word to describe this.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
You could refer to this as phenomenon or a mental image.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
And everything is a mental image.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to discern it as anything.

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
It would not manifest.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
So the mental image of this is just thought.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
It's a mental image.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Or this is just a thought.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
So thoughts are mental images.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Perceptions are mental images.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Feelings are mental images.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Or thoughts are dummies.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Feelings are dummies.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Perception are dummies.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
It's a phenomenon.

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
It's a contemplating arising and falling.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
You're a contemplative arising and falling of mental images.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Yeah.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
The experience as a whole is in foundations.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
It has a reason.

55:20.000 --> 55:27.000
Basically, arising is already existing or changing.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
It's just increasing in its presence.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
But increasing, like fading in, means up.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
It's already changing while it's increasing.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
So the three kinds of arising,

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
persisting or arising, ceasing,

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
and persisting while changing,

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
cool understood and so on,

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
what they're supposed to talk about.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
It's not like three things in a sequence.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
And it's certainly not what people,

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
the many others say,

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
arising, persisting while changing, ceasing.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
That's like a linear observation of something

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
that fully pretends to time,

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
something that you can measure.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Oh, it started.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Now it's lasting.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
Now it's gone.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
And I'm fully out of it.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
No.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
Arising is already the persisting or changing.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Ceasing is already the persisting or changing.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
So it's just like fading in and fading out,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
while it's persisting or changing,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
so it's on two completely different levels.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Arising and ceasing is on one level,

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
persisting or changing is another level.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
So that already means you cannot not include yourself

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
in that form of contemplation.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
So if your general experience as a whole

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
is arising in a certain way,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
it's persisting while changing.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
And if you're aware of that,

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
well, you're aware of you being within that.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Oh, this is arising for me,

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
or to me, or left of me, or right of me.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Well, it's all persisting while changing

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
and you're mindful of that.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
And then in the same sense when something is fading away,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
it's still there.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
It's still a form of appearance.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
That's what I mean.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
You won't find it permanent at the end of the thing.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
That's just another thing there.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
You'll find it within the appearance,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
within the persistence of that thing.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
You'll find that's why it's impermanent,

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
because it persists on its own.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Sadly...

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Can you just hold up?

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
So...

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
Yeah.

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
If you had a battery,

57:40.000 --> 58:03.700
So you can practice this whole thing in regard to get on body right here right now, which

58:03.700 --> 58:09.200
has a position it is, because when you think of my body is seated, you think that stands

58:09.200 --> 58:15.520
for that matter which your body is, and that's already a form of conceiving. So you want

58:15.520 --> 58:19.880
to have a thought, because you can't but not think. So you want to have a thought that

58:19.880 --> 58:25.600
my body is seated, but then you want to leave that thought to be, to the extent that it

58:25.600 --> 58:31.560
wants to be. In other words, you have to recognize it phenomenologically the way it has a reason.

58:31.560 --> 58:37.760
If you do, then it will not be conceiving that because of which that thought is, which

58:37.760 --> 58:43.400
is the four great elements. That's what I was writing in the term determination, that

58:43.400 --> 58:47.000
because of which, because if I use the direct term, people would just think, ah, that's

58:47.000 --> 58:52.280
it, but no, that's another thought. By saying that because of which that thought is, standing

58:52.280 --> 58:57.720
for that because of which that thought is, means, oh, you just conceived that matter because

58:57.720 --> 59:03.880
of which your thought is, including the idea of what that matter is. So just think of

59:03.880 --> 59:08.200
a body posture, but don't think that to be that element, that because of which a body

59:08.200 --> 59:15.080
posture is, so leave or rather imply that matter as inaccessible. And then when your

59:15.080 --> 59:19.960
thoughts are, that matter is inaccessible, that is not accessing in either, that thought.

59:19.960 --> 59:25.440
So you peripherally become more mindful. So you don't have to think about anything else

59:25.440 --> 59:31.680
really in terms of collecting all the data and information and mapping it all out. It's

59:31.680 --> 59:39.800
right here. So remain mindful of the four body postures correctly without them assuming

59:39.800 --> 59:45.080
the four great elements, without your material organs standing for that because of which those

59:45.080 --> 59:53.240
material organs are. And you will not access that matter. Yet you'll be, you'll be knowing

59:53.240 --> 59:59.920
it, so to speak. Because you know that this body, this experience as a whole, is determined

59:59.920 --> 01:00:06.880
by that because of which it's already there. Because if a body determined, it would have

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:17.680
been here already arisen. But then you stop assuming the existence of those determinations.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.720
Which is another way of saying, you stop having those thoughts then standing for that because

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:27.080
of which your thoughts were in the first place. And that's what it means that cessation

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:33.800
of all this encounters. And determinations don't exist anymore. There's nothing to determine

01:00:33.800 --> 01:01:02.320
because there's nothing to access in the first place.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:13.720
But body posture, let's just, when I say body posture, the thoughts of the image of my

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:21.520
body, the sight of my body sitting here. What does every posture have in common? What

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.920
is the image of every posture has in common? The image of the body. Yeah. Which is why we

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:32.600
can just be mindful of the body is there to the extent necessary for the final knowledge.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:39.880
But always the posture in itself is generally enough. But yeah, it's not the fundamental.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:45.400
But the reason why it's good to think of posture because it will keep that mental element,

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:54.080
so to speak. It will kind of allow you to not become fully complacent in conceiving the

01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:01.360
image of your body as there which your body is. Because posture is sort of a designation.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah, it's a shape, it's a position of your body, but it's also a designation. Seated

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.800
for mental designation, which means, oh, it's always there because even knowing the body

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.800
to the extent necessary for the final knowledge, that image of the body is already a mental

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.920
designation. And that's, that's, there was no other problem. You just, what the problem

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.960
was, when that designation stood for that because of which that designation was in the first

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:33.040
place, stood for matter, stood for for greater, stood for the five aggregates, which is why

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:40.280
you take up five aggregates like the fire takes up its fuel. But they, they could, they don't

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:57.800
need you. They could be exist without you anyway. Or you can just be in less particular

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.880
and be mindful of your bodily posture while you're doing other things. And then just

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.360
regard that image of your bodily posture upon which you're anchored, mindful as subject

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:15.360
to destruction. And you can't do anything about it. Because that image is generally subject

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:20.040
to destruction. And that image is generally the determination for your, whatever else

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.440
particular things you're doing while you're mindful of that, means whatever you're doing

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:31.680
while you're mindful of that, which is subject to destruction, you won't fully appropriate.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.280
You will remain mindful of it. Why? Because if I tell you, okay, when you go walk about

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.480
your day, do stuff, but in any, in the next minute, there might be a bullet flying through

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:49.880
your brain from some direction. Okay. So you will be going about your business eventually.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:55.480
This will always be in the back of your mind. You're subject to death because if you were

01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:02.240
not subject to death, he wouldn't be possible for that you would arise as a possibility.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:09.200
So by, exactly, by contemplating right things, correct things as impermanent as you will

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.400
abandon everything else. Not by just applying blank, oh, it's all impermanent, it's all

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.880
changing now, it's all, that's irrelevant. But you want to see as impermanent, doesn't

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.960
mean that you see it's destruction because if you were to see destruction in your body,

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.840
well, you wouldn't see it, you'll be destroyed. You want to see it as subject to destruction.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.280
Which means it's there, it's manifested, it's present because of that, it's subject

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:49.560
to be destroyed. And seeing things subject to such and such means, seeing things in their

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:56.960
nature. So be mindful, generally experienced as a whole, while you're aware of your body

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:04.960
right here, right now in this particular posture, there is, like fundamental kind of

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.600
pure thought point of your whole general experience, you would be inconceivable if this body is

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:14.280
not alive, it's that simple. So you're mindful of that alive body in this particular

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:19.800
posture, in that particular posture is something that on that level, not only on the level of

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:27.600
your thought, but do you think about it or not, it remains subject to be destroyed. That's

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.360
what it means, you think of it on that level. Oh, whether I think about this or not, even

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:39.920
when I forget, it makes no difference to that nature, it remains subjected to destruction,

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:50.240
it's in that domain, and nothing you can do about it. And that will be a problem of mindfulness,

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:55.840
the results in discernment and wisdom, not, you know, be here now and have a tree and feel

01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:12.000
good about yourself. No, abandon everything, abandon the ship before it sinks away.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:37.200
And even if things are happening too fast, busy, crowd, you can't, like follow, well, which

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.240
you're not supposed to do from the beginning, follow things particularly, but be even more

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:45.000
aware of what's happening particularly. You still know the body is there, and that's

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.720
the reason why all these things can happen in the first place, the body is there, which

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.880
is subject to destruction and peril, which means, well, whatever is happening right here

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:59.040
right now, it's kind of circumstantial, it could have not been, and certainly will not

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:05.960
be. And that's another reason why the whole contemporary

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:11.480
bustle is just so wrong, it's completely the opposite direction from what I'm just saying.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.560
Instead of looking in the general image of your body, then if you're trying to force,

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:22.480
it's kind of constant, actual direct perception of body moving, touching, touching, sitting,

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:28.680
sitting, drinking, drinking, like absorb, absorb yourself in the moment as hard as you can.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.800
And that's completely the other way. You don't want, well, you're not bothered about

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:40.480
being absorbed or not. You want to maintain the background image of a body, that determines

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:47.560
your absorption or lack of it, that determines it, that body which is subject to destruction.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.800
So hence is absolutely no method or technique or subtle mechanical repetition that can

01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:05.800
take you in a direction, that's a recognition, it's a formal understanding.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:23.840
I've seen the body there, but it's certainly the body there, because it's already there,

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:28.000
there's a general awareness, but it's seen there, that body there is, the general awareness

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.200
order implies the body there, then you discern the body there, as that is the way the general

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.680
awareness is possible in the first place. But by doing that, I'm going to include in my

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:48.200
salvation. That's the thing, but doing that, you leave no room for yourself to step outside

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:53.320
and be excluded. So include everything, so whatever yourself, yourself tries to move,

01:08:53.320 --> 01:09:05.640
it will be within that room. And you can't do that, but by trying to reach the most general

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.560
thought, they will kind of hold over the other thought, because there's more general to

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:16.640
that then. But you do that by seeing that any thought, no matter how far it goes, or how

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:24.440
particularly absorbed the focus is, is determined, but this position body out there, that's

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:33.240
subject to destruction. That's one matter and body, is the interchangible, it's the same

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:39.760
word, often it was interchangible, it will refer to as matter as the matter of your body,

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:47.000
it will refer to Rupa, because it is in Kaya, but inconceivable there's a Rupa, and often

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.240
that's the Rupa, you know. But not the actual Rupa, because the actual Rupa is inaccessible,

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:58.600
the four elements, inaccessible, but that's the closest proximity I was talking in relation

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.760
to, like, all these four bodies. So it was often referred to in the same word as you

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:26.360
would refer to the matter. So whatever, even if your thoughts of confusion, you can't make

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:33.360
it a lot, you can think that while you're in this body's position here is such determining

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:38.760
the durability to think that in the first place, and that body is subject to destruction,

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.860
and you know that. In the beginning you might have to think about it more, but after

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:46.360
a while it just becomes implicit in that image of that body, which means your mindfulness

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:54.360
gets established quicker, more properly, more skilled. So it's not about changing what

01:10:54.360 --> 01:11:05.360
is a reason, it's just recognizing the inherent undermining structure of that. And that's

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:12.960
it, it's undermining, it can't access it directly, that which undermines you, because if you

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.440
would, it means you would be undermining it, it would be undermining you. So it's always

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:26.440
below your feet, undermining you. So you recognize that, it means, well, you're not going

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:32.440
to hold anything, that's being undermined. And then you're also real as well, actually,

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:39.120
yeah. I was not supposed to hold this at all from the start, because it was never used

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:51.120
to begin with, because if it were used, it wouldn't have been undermined. And I'm always

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:59.120
there when I'm discerning the body or being mindful of by recognizing the nature of the

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.120
body subject to destruction. You include that, yeah, because you can never include directly

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:12.120
your sense of self. You can't own me, I'm subject to this, no, except it kind of slides

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.120
somewhere else, your sense of self. So then what you're thinking is your sense of self,

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:22.120
it's not. So you can only approach it indirectly. So, oh, there is me in this general experience,

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:27.120
I'm sitting here, I'm breathing, I'm doing this, I'm doing that while this seated body

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:35.120
remains on the chair, fully subject to destruction. And then that self that you will be experienced

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:41.120
is not self. That's why automatically. So if you recognize correctly implements and

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:48.120
suffering, you don't then do, oh, so this is my not self. No, then your experience as a

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:54.120
whole is automatically the experience of not self. You do that long enough, you will recognize

01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:00.120
that it's, that's what not self is. By recognizing what's really not self, well,

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.120
you'll stop holding your view of yourself. So you become sort of one who is free from

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:14.120
art of art, which is not recognizing what actually not self is. So for as long as you see

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.120
the not self in front of you means, ah, you excluded your sense of self, ah, which means

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:25.120
that's not not self. But if you do it, it's just what you said, when you general experience

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.120
as all whatever you are doing, I'm sitting here talking, whatever else, while my body,

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.120
while this material body is seated, completely subject to destruction from any direction and

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:40.120
I absolutely cannot even foresee it happening. I just know that it's subject to it.

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:49.120
Automatically, whatever I do, while I have that perception established, will be non self.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.120
Which is exactly, see how hard it is because it's not the hard once you recognize it,

01:13:54.120 --> 01:14:00.120
then you know what to look for. If you had the utterance of another explaining it,

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.120
sufficient enough, but you can see one over, it can become another and you'll even

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:10.120
see another one by accident. Because you can't recognize, like many people can do this.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:17.120
Oh, you see this subject, but you can't do it long enough. You can accidentally do it once or twice or three times.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.120
But you can't accidentally repeat it thousands of times, which is the number of times most likely

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:29.120
required for somebody to recognize that as a principle. So that's why the effort,

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:35.120
the effort, the effort, the repetition and so on. That's what practice is about.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:41.120
Recognize what you're supposed to discern and then keep doing it, and keep doing it,

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.120
and keep doing it. Without somebody telling you, you're supposed to do that.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.120
It's impossible to do it thousands of times. You just can't.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.120
Hence you can't stumble upon it by a chance. Oh, yeah.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.120
It was a fortunate night. It was just like that. It all happened. I'm so lucky.

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:06.120
It doesn't work like that. If it did, it's because you spend the whole night doing this work.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:12.120
And then you know, I've done it. And for that very reason, it cannot be taken away.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:18.120
It didn't come through any external circumstance, nothing. Not given, cannot be taken away.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:23.120
Recognized as already there. And because it's already there,

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:29.120
there is nothing to do with it. That's why everybody refers to it as an ancient part.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.120
And I could reveal it again, but it was there. Because if you weren't there,

01:15:33.120 --> 01:16:02.120
this came from us there would not be possible.
