00:00.000 --> 00:27.000
And so my first question was actually, you spoke about it in the last video by, as it happens,

00:27.000 --> 00:37.000
was related to what you mean by delighting in sensuality.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
But you did speak about it in the last video and it was quite clear when you said that it's kind of in that attitude of anticipation,

00:48.000 --> 01:00.000
an initial attitude of anticipation or background attitude of anticipation towards a particular experience or something.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
And then I think the question that I wanted to just to make sure that just to clarify it is,

01:09.000 --> 01:28.000
what would be the difference between delighting in a sensual thought of sensual nature and engaging mentally in a sensuality?

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Is there a difference between those two things?

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
Well, yes, but they're not on the same level. If you were not delighting, you wouldn't be able to engage mentally.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
So delight is the basis for mental engagement. So you can then not engage mentally, but still delight.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
But if you don't delight, even thinking about the sensuality of sensuality, there's no delight.

01:55.000 --> 02:10.000
Okay, that's good, that's kind of what I thought. The delight is more like the necessary condition for you to be able to engage in a thought of sensual nature in a sense that's...

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
To welcome it, to enlighten it, except for the joy that promises and so on, basically to take it for granted.

02:19.000 --> 02:35.000
And so even if you're just sitting and not even moving or doing anything, there is a difference between having an attitude of wanting to go towards something, welcoming it and delighting it.

02:35.000 --> 02:49.000
And then you can then even actively, then there is this active thinking about something of whatever pleasant experience that you want to have or something that you can actively be thinking about it.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
But before that, there has to be already, or prior, let's say, underlying it, there is that attitude.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Which remains there. It gives you the meaning, gives the context of what your mind is revolving around.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
And that's why, that's why a lot of people would more often than often meditate with sensuality. I mean, suit us the same.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
And the point is exactly that, so you might be saying no to the central objects, so you're not engaging with them.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
You're refusing to think about them, you're concentrating away from them, you're getting rid of those thoughts.

03:21.000 --> 03:41.000
But is your mind still expecting pleasure, delight in joyful ideas of whatever meditation experience and so on, and say, yes, so that's, that is your intention, that is your context, that is your motivation.

03:41.000 --> 03:53.000
So when you sit to meditate, to sit to meditate in a way of discerning the enduring body there, the basis for the subject to do all these reflections,

03:53.000 --> 04:04.000
or you sit to meditate to constantly devote to get, to produce the experience of pleasing kind. And then that's just exactly the same central principle.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Okay, yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
That's in that sense, like even people would take on the seal and the virtue, but in that kind of a conditional way.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
They would take it because yes, they were told they need to take it in order to get this special experience of meditation and enlightenment.

04:20.000 --> 04:32.000
But if you're actually, if your meditation is on the level of reviewing your situation, the body, the context, the danger, the pattern, the disenchantment, that is better to give it up, then you realize, oh no,

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
a seal of virtue is what protects me from falling deeper into this. It's not conditional anymore.

04:39.000 --> 04:50.000
It's indirectly for what it is, abstaining from certain axes, what created this context of recognizing the trap, the bait, and everything else.

04:50.000 --> 05:02.000
That brings me to another, yeah, that's exactly the other thing I wanted to ask about or check.

05:02.000 --> 05:21.000
Is that this, it seems that the danger in relation to sensuality or sin, but again, I have another come back to that in a minute.

05:21.000 --> 05:45.000
Or even the whole domain of the senses and engagement into the senses involved with the senses, because there's, let's say, two broadly speaking aspects of danger that kind of appear more or less clearly to me at different times.

05:45.000 --> 06:02.000
One of which is really in relation to the nature of this particular type of, let's say, you kind of, you can learn to recognize a particular type of, let's say, perception, or if you're in seclusion, there's nothing else, it's more like a thought, type of thought.

06:02.000 --> 06:28.000
It's not about, initially, it will be about certain types of objects, but it's more about the nature of the thought that it contains an invitation or a hook, or it requires you to, it wants you to do something to become involved in a particular type of sense of object, or a particular type of activity or experience in some way.

06:28.000 --> 06:49.000
Like, then in relation to that, there is the danger of, like, the mind becoming disturbed, and you having to kind of hand yourself, you becoming involved, hand yourself on this particular object, or, let's put it like that.

06:49.000 --> 07:17.000
That you become dependent on all of this, this experience, getting something, wanting something, what will happen if we don't get it, what will happen on account of this, becoming busy on account of this, and, yeah, so that's the kind of type of, of danger of, the danger of involvement or being required to do a particular thing.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
Is there a more, even more immediate type of danger implicit?

07:23.000 --> 07:46.000
That's, there is, it seems like a second aspect of danger, which is really more about the fact that the, about the nature of the body, such as the senses, as such.

07:46.000 --> 07:54.000
But that nature is there, regardless of whether you're engaged with centrality or not, so what's dangerous about it?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
In one case, why isn't danger is in another case?

07:57.000 --> 08:26.000
Yes, because the reason why, yeah, because if, if you can kind of, let's say,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
you see, you start to recognize that, regardless of...

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
Well, let's say, where does the pain come from, suffering? What's the origin of suffering?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
The craving.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
The craving, yeah. And what is the, where does the craving exist?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Is it a physical thing?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
No, it's an in your attitude towards things.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So it's a mental thing.

08:51.000 --> 09:01.000
Is the mental craving, which any craving is mental, so is the craving a method of choice?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Can you choose the craving, which is not to crave?

09:04.000 --> 09:12.000
So craving is something the mind does, which means suffering is something that mind causes.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
Is the mind something you ask for, something you can control, something you can own, something that obeys you?

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
No, kind of, you are aligned with it, so to speak.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
It obeys you most of the time, if the circumstances are alright.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
But if circumstances change, that's when you realize that mind doesn't actually want to listen to you.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
You can't stop it. And then you suffer and counter it.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
So then, you want to be free from suffering, means you need to be free from craving,

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
which means you need to teach your mind how to stop doing it.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Or you need to basically understand your mind or semantic mind.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Either way, mind does the craving.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
So how do you then stop that?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And that's where the danger is.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
The danger of sensuality is the danger of still, the slight doesn't matter.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
The little bit of sensuality means there is still a little possibility of that mind craving against you.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
Against itself, resisting, but eager against anything that that, and you can't control that.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
So you cannot, you can have wishful thinking and hope that the mind won't,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
because you know, you're so calm and you've been keeping precepts for so long.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Fundamentally, for as long as there is a trace of sensuality,

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
the other backside of that same trace, same phenomenon, same values of sensuality

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
is the value of the wild mind, which means the craving remains there.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
And if you want to see whether your mind still has that uncontrollable threat

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
that would turn against itself and cause you immense suffering,

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
if circumstances change, if you lose health, life and so on,

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
you have just practiced sensory strain and solitude and you'll see when the mind doesn't get what he wants,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
it's going to start getting wound up.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
And then you will recognize that that's the root of the suffering.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
It's the craving.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
So I can't stop the craving.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I can't will it away.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I can't just choose it.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
But what I can do is take the mind so it becomes unable to turn against itself.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
And that's where it recognizes true dangerous sensuality.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
So giving in to sensual desire, even on the mental level,

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
valuing it means allowing mind to remain wild to that extent.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
And sooner or later, that will bite you back.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
So it's not a delayed danger.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
It's the other side of the same coin.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
And that's that when danger becomes apparent, means this,

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
as we said, this anticipation, this delight,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
literally this thing while it is present,

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
the background of it is mind eating itself, the possibility of it.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Won't do it there, but the fact is you're allowing it.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
And if you go that way, to that extent,

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
you gave your own mind room to turn against itself.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
And then it will.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Sooner or later, it will.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
As long as you don't abandon that attitude and that anticipation

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
and you don't see thoroughly the peril of giving in to that direction.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Once you do, and as the Buddha said,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
you drive up from sensuality internally,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
then the mind, the animal will be completely tamed.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
It will forget how to turn against itself.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And that's where you recognize that, okay, so now,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
suffering cannot arise.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Even if the circumstances are completely falling apart around me.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Everything, disintegrating.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
What cannot happen is mind turned against itself,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
because you tamed it.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
But you won't aim it for as long as there is,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
as long as you allow it to eat the bait,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
or welcome the bait with delight in the bait.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Think about the bait.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
And the bait, really, is basically a prospect of pleasure.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Sure.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
But the value of pleasure, delight and pleasure,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
prospect of pleasure.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
So the bait is also, like, it's not prospect of pleasure.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
You can show the bait, but it also

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
simply cannot seem the danger enough.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
That's also what the bait is.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
That's what it means.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
You are not recognizing the bait.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Seeing the danger is how you basically stop by the end of pleasure,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
and recognize the bait.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
The bait is the bait.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yeah, the bait is the bait.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
So it's not, well, I'm trying to say,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
it's not like that you don't need to actively seek out,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
and then, oh, I don't actively seek out,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
thus I'm free from bait.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
No, do you now, by OK, you don't actively seek out,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
but do you now see the danger if you were to seek out?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And if you don't see the danger, to that extent,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
yeah, you still don't see the bait.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
You don't see the bait.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
You don't see the danger.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, exactly.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
And when the bait, or when this prospect is seen as the bait,

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
as something that will hook me, then delight.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
Well, no, when the prospect of that anticipation

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
is seen, this thing is what makes mind bite itself.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Exactly.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
That's what I meant.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That's when there's nothing, no pleasure in the world.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Because it's not that it's that like they...

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
It's nothing to do with the thing you want.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
It's nothing.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
It's that like...

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Giving it to that or maintaining that or not seeing the danger

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
that it perpetuates, enables the mind,

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
and it perpetuates that enabling of mind to bite itself.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
When things change, when you apparently what you don't want,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
separate it from what you want, you know,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
the five codes of central pleasure and so on,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and you know that, you know that.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
You will not be able to stop it.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
You can just hope and ignore it, but factually,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
if there is a room for a mind to bite itself,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
it will.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Because you're out of it.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
And that's the danger.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
So, yes, you can involve the future peril,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
and this satisfaction, sure, to reign it in,

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
but fundamentally, accepting this means mind biting itself.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah, that's exactly what I meant.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
It's so nice to...

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Matches.

15:25.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah, like the danger is in that any kind of...

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
That's what you just said.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm going to repeat it, but that is the danger.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
It's nothing to do with what will happen

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
in the future, what could happen in the future,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
or whatever, because, yeah, that's like,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
oh, it could not happen, or it could be fine,

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
or whatever.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
But it's just that fact of being hooked,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
like having this...

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah, having a hook, having a push,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
having any kind of craving is in itself

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
to be not desired, to be not welcomed.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Because it's the way...

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
It's like the gateway to hell, really.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
It's...

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah, this great mass of suffering,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
as the person described.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
That's the great way to...

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
That's it. That's because of that.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
The great mass of suffering,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
and the great mass of suffering,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
is always on the count of the same.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
The same.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
The presence of craving.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah, that is...

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Everything else is second to it.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
And as we describe, presence of craving,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
full stop is something that the mind

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
that has a been-tain will do.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
When faced with a agreeable,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
disagreeable or neutral,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
which means the great mass of suffering

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
remains something that you are under.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
So you are liable to it,

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
you will be subjected to it.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
But, if the danger of centrality

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
has been understood, I...

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Oh, okay.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
So, without...

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
If I don't give in to this,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
if I don't welcome this,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
because now I see,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
if I do, this is the result.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
The result is,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
mind remaining able

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
to eat itself,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
if it wants to.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
In a split second,

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
not like, you know,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
it will not be a long process.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
All you need to do is face with something

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
you don't want to face with,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
and all the dread and pain

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
and everything will be instantaneously there.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Because the mind will just try to

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
turn away from it.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Who resisted it?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Because again, you let it,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
you gave it room to do so.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And that's why it's...

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
It's hard to see,

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
because, you know,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
room to do so,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
doesn't mean the mind is doing it all the time.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
So, you then forget that the mind can still do it.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
It can still turn against itself.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
It can still want to deny its own existence,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
out of pain and aversion and hatred

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
and ill will and so on.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
But because it's not doing that all the time,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
you sort of forget

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
that there is room for it to still

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
turn around and sink its teeth.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
So, that's the danger.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
And that was something...

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
That was another point, that's...

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That's why...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Like, it's not...

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
Being like having a kind of a sense of safety or something

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
is not about just currently not feeling

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
any sort of pressure of the sensual kind

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
because you can have that,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
even for quite a long time, for example.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Sure.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
But as soon as something comes up,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
something arises,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
if at that moment,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
then you will be going in that direction,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
not able to see the problem

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
and not recognizing it for what it is.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Then there is no safety, really, at all.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
So, it's...

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
So, where is the safety then?

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Then the safety is when you know where the danger is,

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
then you know that no matter when it will...

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
So, you know now that the danger is in mind being able

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
to turn against itself.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
So, what is then the safety?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Well, if you see the danger of that,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
then the...

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
If the mind is able to turn itself against itself,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
what makes the mind being able to turn itself against itself?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
That's something that you are responsible for,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
but you can't choose to not do.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
So, if you recognize the danger of doing that,

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
which makes the mind able to turn against itself,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
then you can not do that.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah, and then eventually,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
the mind will cease to be able to turn against itself.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
And then that's true safety.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
You can't suffer.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Craving cannot arise.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, so you said that now, like recognizing

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
where the danger is,

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
is the necessary condition for safety.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
And then is there...

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
But is there, yeah, is there also a sense

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
that they kind of...

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
I think it's something slightly different.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000
Let's say from the perspective of

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
not having any safety,

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
there is...

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
If you're still in the domain of sensuality

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
and kind of involved in it,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I kind of don't see how it's possible

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
in a way to see the danger in it.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
It kind of requires at least say,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
maybe not the complete sense of safety,

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
but at least a pretty complete seclusion

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
in order to then have the perspective of...

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
That's very sensory-spainting,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
garden with the sense those

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
is a prerequisite that's normally optional.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Yeah.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
It needs to be your lifestyle,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
your more complete feeling.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah, of course.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
In itself, you will still not see

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
where the danger is and so on.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
But for sure, if you're not withdrawn,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
then you're removing the possibility of seeing it.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And it's like we said before,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
like lighting the fire.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
We need them out of the water first.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Like, if you try to light the fire

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
with sticks in the water,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
that's just not going to work.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
So you take them out, but they're still wet.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So although, yes, they're out of water.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
They're still wet, so they still won't light the fire.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
But now at least there is a possibility

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
that they're drying.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
If you don't put them back in the water.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
And while they're dry,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
thoroughly, then you can light the fire.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And that's it. The mind is first physically

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
be drawn from sensuality,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
not giving it to this behavior,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
because you recognize on it, no.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Like our faith to the degree,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
but at the same time, you do recognize,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I've been going down the direction of the senses,

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
my whole life.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And look, I want to practice.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I want to be free from suffering,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
because this is what it resulted in.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So then you found the Buddhist teaching,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
you have a degree of faith, you start applying it.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And you can even intellectually make sense

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
that actually it's better if I'm out of the water.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Even if I've done a silly seed,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and so on.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Well, at least I have the possibility to do so,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
if I stay out of the water.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And like that.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
But in and of itself, that's not a goal.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Yeah, exactly.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
The goal is to light the fire,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and you don't forget that.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And again, just to clarify slightly further,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
that being out of the water,

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
because this could be maybe understood in different ways,

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
as far as I can see,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
it really has to become quite

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
complete seclusion, as in

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
it wouldn't really be,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
because yeah, it can be kind of more or less

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
restrained and keeping the virtue.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
But if you are still like busy

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
doing various things,

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
and kind of distracting yourself in any way,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
really, then you kind of can't really even see

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
the which type of

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
is the...

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Yeah, well that's like seeing the danger in the slightest fault.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
There's not mean seeing the danger in the slightest fault

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
of the latter,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
and the semantics of the rule,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
means the danger of the slightest fault

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
of, okay, so yes, I'm not giving this...

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I'm not giving it to desire by body,

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
but to this course extent,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
that I'm still looking forward to

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
anything things that are allowable, as we said before.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Also, I'm gonna stop eating, you must stop eating with that desire.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
You can't stop eating.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
That's the point.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
But if a person never recognized that that's where the true danger

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
and the fault is,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
and still remain on the level of, you know,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
or I studied all the dictionary,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and I got the definition of the rule,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
and this is what objectively means,

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
and our fault in regard to that interpretation

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
is what I didn't even fault.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I just need to fix the circumstances

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
and make everybody else obey it.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
That's not seeing the fault.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That's not allowing, basically,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
vinegar and sensitive strength

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
to make your practice on the level of the mind.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
That is just using it to protect yourself

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
through that magical belief that that's where the purity is.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
So, in order to abandon

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
so about the Paramasya,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
and it's not in the letter,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
it's not in the definition,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
it's in like, why am I doing this?

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
So, you'll find something that's not against the rules,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
but that still doesn't absolve you from needing to know

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
and feel the weight of why you're doing it.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Yes, coffee is allowable to have in the afternoon,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
and I can have sugar.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
But why?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Why am I doing this?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Where is this rooted?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, yeah, it's been, you know,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
very often touched, you know, with a bowing,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
triple bowing on a tray.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
So, it's just a pure suffering,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I can imagine, in that external form sense.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
But, yeah, but that's,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
that's irrelevant.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
The fault is not in how it was done and presented.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
The fault is why am I doing this?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Do I need it? Why, why is this rooted?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And then same would come to exactly like,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
oh, yeah, so, you know,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
we are allowed to work and do these things,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and like, but it will work.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah, what I was like seeing is, you know,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
in the city where it is, where it is,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
where it is.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Well, it's the same stuff, you know,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
one of the studies.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
One, these duties that you perceive

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
are kind of self-evident and objectively valid.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
That's not where the validity is determined.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It's determined by your intentions

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
and the reasons why you do it.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
So, yes, obvious things are of greed,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
version delusion, eight presets basically

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
are not to be broken.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
But now all the other in permutation

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
doesn't mean you can dismiss them.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Quite the opposite.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Means you need to take more of them just on the right level.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Less specifically,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
but more because you're taking responsibility

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
for where the actual fault is.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
The mind of desire,

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
mind of aversion, and mind of distraction.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
But if we judge what needs to be done

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
on the base of authority of the texts,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
which is again a contradiction in terms,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
like, you will always have your interpretation of it.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
There is no such thing as objective meaning of the text.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It's what it means to you and to us.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And vast majority of people

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
might agree upon the meaning,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
but every single one of them

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
is individually subjective and responsible

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
for that meaning.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
So, the weight of the tradition,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
the authority, and so on,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
that's not where these things are.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
But if you never abandon that,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
out of fear of doubt and so on,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
well, you never allow your mind

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
to recognize where the true fault is

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
and thus have brewed it,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
out of fear of doubt.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
So, that's when you're like,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
you need to get out of the water

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
for the sake of drying the sticks,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
not for the sake of drying out the water

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and then just, you know,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
defining what the water was and how you dry

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
and, you know, what you must, what you can,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
what you cannot do.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
From the point of view of desire,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
you can't do anything.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
You're not out of water.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
If the light in the fire is your goal.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
If not, you know,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
if just living in a spiritual community

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
that agrees upon certain terms and interpretations,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
is your goal then fine.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
But that's not what we're talking about.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
So, just to come back to this,

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
the degree of, let's say,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
the degree of seclusion.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
And it's, I think, in the studies that

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
sometimes even says like,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
he goes into physical seclusion

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
and mental seclusion.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Physical or physical withdrawal

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
and mentally secluded.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
Or mentally withdrawn.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Can you be mentally withdrawn if you're not physically withdrawn?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
No, you cannot.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
So, there's the physical sense of withdrawal

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
but even there, it needs more

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
than, like, physically

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
being secluded as in a secluded environment

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
or just being restrained.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
There is necessity for mental

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
to be mentally withdrawn

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
from even mentally engaging

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
in unwholesome things

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
for which you need to be able to already see

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
how you are mentally engaging with unwholesome things.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
In order to then be able to see the danger

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
in doing so, in order to then

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
kind of have any kind of sense of safety.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
So, in other words,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
you need to basically

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
want to light the fire.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And in order to do so,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
you need to abandon

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
things, external things,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
avoidance of responsibilities,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
external authorities, external agreements,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
as the measure of your safety,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
purity, practice

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
and defining what you need to do.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
You need to abandon your perceived sense of duty.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
So, you need to abandon

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
so about Parmas basically.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
That's used. You know, these fetters

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and all these random things, they serve purpose.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You're fettered willingly

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
by them because they protect you

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
from that which is very displeasing.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
The weight of responsibility,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
the weight of interpretation,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
the weight of choices and so on.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
So, you have a choice to make.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
You can remain sheltered,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
covering things up.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
And if you want to uncover it,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
then you have to unshelter it.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
That's to me like,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
the true safety comes from mind being unable

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
to turn against itself.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
But in order to arrive there,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
you need to stop covering up the fact

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
that the mind can't turn against itself.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Oh, but I'm fine.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You know, I keep the precepts and the pure

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
and the devotional and stuff.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
That is all just conditional.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
Sure, that's nice in a worldly sense.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
But then you need to start asking yourself,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
why am I doing this?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
If I took, oh no, I agree with this,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
with this tradition of interpretation

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
or whatever else the way we should do.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Fine, but you still need to know why

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and take responsibility for it.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
It's never on them. It's never on others.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
It's never on the, as I said,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
on the external world.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Even if you say, yeah, I'll agree

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
to what you already agreed.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
That still doesn't absorb me from needing to know

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
why I'm doing that and think for myself

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
and take responsibility for it.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
But often that's exactly why it's done.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I will go with majority,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
with the tradition, with the established voice

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
so I don't have to think for myself.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
But you are thinking for yourself,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
now you're just lying to yourself about it.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Because how would you choose to go

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
with the tradition with established voice

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
unless you thought about it?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And gave into it. And now you're just saying,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
no, no, I just go, but I do what others say.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
So you do need to take responsibility for it

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
and then it ceases to be on that level.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
And then you realize it's all,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
it is all interpretation.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
It precepts that interpretation.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Like, yeah, you know,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
you can bend in this way, bend in that way, sure.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
But fundamentally, you realize, okay,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
you could extrapolate the principle of

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
creed, the version delusion, central desire,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
ill will,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
carelessness, distraction.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
That is what needs to be restrained.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
How we define it? And can I touch this?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
And if it's touch, can I do this?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Well, you know, if I said it,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
okay, you can go into these details if it's helpful.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
But not for the sake of deriving safety

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
from the definition that you read in a book

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
or had seen your mind told you.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
But simply from knowing more

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
how to recognize the root of the problem

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
in your mind.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
So the degree delusion doesn't hide from you

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
or did you don't feel absorbed from it?

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
So when I recognize that there is nothing

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I, nothing at all,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I have to do.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
For nothing at all that I can do

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
that can absorb me from taking the

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
responsibility for whatever I choose to do.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Yeah, also,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
so the more, on a more immediate level,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
it will be, if you abandon still about

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
parmasters, it will be like,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
oh, I don't need to do anything

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
in order to be safe.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And that's some safe.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
So the relief of abandoning the factors,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
it's factual.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It's not intellectual.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
And it's on the exact same level.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
See, it is a burden.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Having to define, having to follow,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
having to update, having to comply,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
having to do, having to perform.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
All of that is a factual burden.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
You don't see the burden in aspect

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
because you emphasize the sheltering aspect.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Once you stop sheltering,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
in that aspect, you can actually eventually,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
if you go into the right direction,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
abandon the burden,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
if I don't engage that way,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I remain safe.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I remain unexposed.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
So in a way, it's on the count of

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
the loss of respect.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I don't understand.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Like you said, that you

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
pay more attention in a way to the

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
sheltering aspect, but not to

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
how it affects you.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I wouldn't say it's on a kind of loss of

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
respect because you never had the respect.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
You start by not having the respect.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
So it's on a kind of

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
the lack of respect.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Loss would imply you sort of had it

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
and then you lost it.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
But, you know, you start already

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
fatted.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
That's

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
why

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
it's like in a way that

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
like, said about a parama so, for example,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
kind of covers up.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
That's what it does.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
It's what its purpose is really

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
is to make something appear

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
comfortable or feel comfortable.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
That isn't comfortable.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And it shouldn't be comfortable.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And as in this...

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
What do you mean?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Because

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
the avoiding responsibility

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
for things through having things

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
duties and others

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
depending on other things

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
that you...

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It kind of

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
makes this...

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Yeah, makes it comfortable.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I see what you mean.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
It makes it doable,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
but actually nothing is changed

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
on a fundamental level.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
You're not closer to light in the fire.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And so, you shouldn't be comfortable.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You should recognize that

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
there is still

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
plenty of room

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
for mind to turn against itself

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
in many different ways.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
But yeah, you will feel

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
absolved from needing to deal with it

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
because, you know,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
abide under the

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
collective responsibility

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
of majority that we all contributed

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and all but take. And I'm safe.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Safe to the group.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Safe to the tribe.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
It's kind of gone off

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
in a different...

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
It's a very different direction.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I wanted to come back to the...

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
If it's okay,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
we're kind of going in different directions.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I wanted to come back to the hindrances.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Um...

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Because...

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Another question I had,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I was...

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Because I often...

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I realized, basically, that often I would...

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Sometimes it's not that clear to me,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
even what

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
exactly is meant

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
by, uh,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
thought or a...

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Like a...

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Because sometimes...

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I often...

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I'm kind of...

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I think of it in terms of

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
not necessarily defined by particular...

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah, particular objects

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
or having...

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Even something necessarily being agreeable in a way.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
What I realized that

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
sometimes things that I was thinking of as, like,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
yeah, sensuality

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
and...

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Because it really pertains to, like,

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
engaging in some kind of experience

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
or feeling like the need to do something, really.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Um...

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
But it's not really...

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
It would kind of come down to, like,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
oh, that's more like doubt, or that's more, like,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
kind of, one other one of the hindrances.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
They do share the same kind of the same, yeah.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
That's the thread of hindrances.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
That's the bond together.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
So, it can be on the level of specific

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
touch, on, like, the overall, uh,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
agreeability of the, of, you know,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
the experience.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
But, uh, it does always imply that

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
that sense of pleasure,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
which is considered safe, friendly,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
agreeable to me.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
That's when that's what the Brumel Vitox

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
was, perfect syllabus.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
It starts by, yeah, not having sexual intercourse.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Uh, whether you're talking to monks

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
or not having sexual intercourse with women,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
they're not touching them,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
they're not going to be touched,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
they're not, uh, talking to them,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
they're not listening to them talk,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
they're not looking at them,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
they're not thinking about them,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
they're not wishing about having a divorce.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Hmm.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
So, it was the extension of the same principle.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
So, okay, I might have abandoned

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
any kind of physical corner,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
all these pleasures that would be binding me here.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Oh, but I still hope that this,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I will find somewhere else here.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
So, new here, where it will be

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
and safe for me, where pleasures will be accessible.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Hmm.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
So, in other words, uh,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
are you still valuing

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
a situation external

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
to your state of mind here and now?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Hmm.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
That will provide the ability and pleasure.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
There is a thread of centrality, yeah.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
And that's when, like, if, same,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
like with its meditation or any other,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
if you're expecting this thing to come on the level of just this external experience

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
that just happened internally now

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
and everything else,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
you know, it's a very simple principle, yeah.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah, yeah.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
And what kind of...

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
So, you might, you know, sorry,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
like, you know, you can't,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
you cannot necessarily tell your mind

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
to immediately stop thinking about those things.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
But you can certainly not lose perspective or learn

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
after not lose perspective,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
or are kind of having those thoughts present.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Hmm.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Yeah, and the thing that's...

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
And what would be the perspective, by the way?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Let's say, how would you not lose a perspective

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
of the spectrum of sexual intercourse

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
with a, you know,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
where we're not attracted to?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Up to the level of wishing heavenly rebirths

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
and safety of heavens.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
What is the...

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
How would you maintain perspective

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
at any part of that spectrum?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Any thought, whatever it is,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
what would maintain the perspective of the entire thing?

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Of the entire domain?

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
What would maintain the perspective of the...

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
What would make you not lose perspective?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Whether it's a course,

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
carnal, central,

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
or heavenly...

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Well, it would be recognizing that danger

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
of that whole...

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
It's the same danger.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Yeah, it's the same danger of whether it's...

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Yes, heavens, you know, it's better.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Actually, sure.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
If you have desire to heavens, then having desire to come

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
and pleasure here and now, which your far was,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
with far worse consequences,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
unintended consequences.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
But fundamentally, if you want to be free from it all,

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
you don't want to leave the slightest room for your mind

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
to turn against itself,

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
even in hundreds of millions of years of time in the future,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
it's the same danger.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
And then there will be no room for mind.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
And then the craving will truly be abandoned.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Yeah.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Yeah, yeah.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
If the danger is seen there,

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
then it really doesn't matter at all,

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
whether there is no kind of even...

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Asking, oh, but it's a little or it's bigger,

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
it's smaller or not even...

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Whatever way it would never domain,

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
in whatever shape, whatever it's not about,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
it's like...

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
And the thing is, as well...

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
And that's what Google described in the suit

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
as, you know, talk about aggregates and how it's

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
it's dangerous and I'm similar.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
And we said, it doesn't matter.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
But it's past, future, present, big, small, personal,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
impersonal, foreign, familiar,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
nice, light, heavy.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
And after the property of it,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
the danger is seen the same.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Not mind, not to be welcomed,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
not to be delighted in.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
And see that long enough,

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
and the mind will come down.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
In other words, the mind will become unable

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
to turn against itself.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
God cannot be done anymore.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
And that's like the description of the true freedom,

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
the true safety.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
It cannot be reverted back,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
like a stone split into leaves,

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
sort of dried up.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
It cannot now go back.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
So it has completely dried.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Fire as bullets, sticks will burn.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
God, there are no more sticks to be wet.

41:21.000 --> 41:28.000
But then from the perspective of valuing pleasure,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
that's exactly what a safety is seen.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
That's exactly what is seen as safe, basically.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
What is...

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
What is dangerous, so to say.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Like the bait.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Sure, sure.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
The prospect of, oh, let me get this.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Yeah, let me have it.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
That's my safety.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
That's my safety.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I enjoy the comfort of familiarity,

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
the feeling, so the taste, the bait has.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
And as we said last time,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
it does not start when I act.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah, exactly.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
It starts when I already...

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
With the lightness, you're already...

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
You're already not seeing it as dangerous.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
That's where it starts.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
And that's exactly what the...

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Yeah, why?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
That's even the danger is in the delights,

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
in towards it.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
That's the gratification, that's the danger of us.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
It's all on that, in that same kernel.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
It's the same thing on it.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Just different aspects of it.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
That's how you keep it away is the same thing in a way.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
So yeah, if you were to not act out of the delights long enough

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
and get to discern the background, not ignored,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
you would see that the background over there is the bait.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The delight is the bait.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Exactly.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
The bait is the danger, the delight is the danger.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
It is the danger.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Exactly.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
That's really...

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
And all the future consequences, it's all because of this.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
This is the framework, this is the necessary basis.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
This will be there if those consequences are ever too clear.

42:40.000 --> 42:47.000
And yeah, from the perspective of seeing that,

42:47.000 --> 42:54.000
then the slightest prospect of going towards that,

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
going in that direction, is very unpleasant, actually.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Or it would be very unpleasant.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
It's almost like you're out of prison.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
And now you see the prison guard is going,

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
oh, come back in here.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
I have some very nice...

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I don't know, cake.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
But the fear would be on the level of,

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
oh, this crazy mind might forget and go back.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Like, you know you wouldn't.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
But if the mind is still not saying,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
if it still has room to move, you lose, that's the danger.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Yeah.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
And there was the similarly of the charcoal pit.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Yeah, man initially goes willingly there and burns and stuff

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
with the embers because he perceives it pleasant today.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
He gets cured, he doesn't even need to.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
And if somebody were to pick him up and carry him there,

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
wouldn't he kick and scream,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
wouldn't he be everywhere else except there?

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Yeah.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
And it's like, yeah.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And you really can't see like,

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
cause, you know, why would anybody want to,

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
like, actually go in that direction when,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
but you do, that's what I kind of meant.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
In a way for that, you do already need the perspective

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
of safe, like some kind of safety.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
You can't have that kind of perspective

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
from already being in it and seeing that as the safety.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
Yeah, do you want to have, like, you know,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
seeing that principle will be done on different levels,

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
like different layers.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
You'll be peeling it more and more.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
But yeah, it will be the same thing.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
But up until to the point, you realize that if I were to die

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
the next second, will my mind have aversion towards that?

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
Will it try to sort of, you know, resist it,

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
fight it, deal with it, avoid it, close its eyes,

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
look away.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
If so, or if I'm not sure,

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
means there is still room for it to move,

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
to fight itself.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
So that cannot, should not be allowed,

44:37.000 --> 45:03.000
if I want to be truly free, secured from bondage.
