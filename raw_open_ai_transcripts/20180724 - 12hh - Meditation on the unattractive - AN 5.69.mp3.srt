1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
Give this from me and good to Danikai to call this enchantment, because these five things

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,680
when developed and cultivated lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation,

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,400
to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbana.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
What five?

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,280
Here, Bikudwell is contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:39,120
of food, perceiving non-delight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,480
conditions phenomena, and he has the perception of death well-established eternally, internally.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,520
These five things when developed and cultivated lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion,

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:02,040
to peace, to acknowledge, and admire, and this is a game from the enchantment, and what

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,440
an under is the perception of unattractiveness.

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,440
Here, Bikudwell reviews this body upward from the souls of the feet, and downward from the

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,840
tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin as full of many kinds of impurities.

13
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,840
They are in this body, hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,160
senus, bone, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, intestines, stomach, excrement,

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,440
bile, fem, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, breath, saliva, snuck, fluid, the joints, and urine.

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,360
Thus, he dwells contemplating unattractiveness in the body, this is called perception of

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
unattractiveness.

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:53,360
He says, this is in regard to the supermeditation, meditation on the unattractiveness, and you

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:02,360
said, yesterday, you were talking about it, and you said that establishing one's mind

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:11,240
on a super, and then making it in urine without losing sight of the peripheral of that

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:20,240
super, even when sensual inclination is present internally or externally, but maybe

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
so.

23
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Well, it comes down to the main point of that is basically you cannot be attracted and

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,280
repelt by the same thing at the same time.

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:44,400
So if that which attracts you, repels you, then you repelt the attraction will cease.

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,120
So that's important thing to realize, because when you read out the bit from Angutanika,

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,920
what is the Buddha recommends like reviewing your body in terms of what is made of, it's

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,280
very easy to do that wrongly, in a sense of you keep bringing the new things, new objects

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,880
of your perceptions into your mind, and then trying to kind of sort of generate a sense

30
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,840
of disgust and dispassion.

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,280
But the point is not to find things that are disgusting as a replacement to things that

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
are attractive.

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,200
The point is to see things that are attractive as underlined by a disgusting things, by things

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,320
that are repelling, by things that are non-attractive.

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,840
So you need to see the simultaneously present there just on a different level.

36
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,920
Because it's easily, you can easily force yourself to not look at the attractive and just

37
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,720
focus on non-attractive, but sooner or later when you're tired, when your mindfulness

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,080
lapses, when attractive arises again, you have no protection against it, because all

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,560
you're used to is doing the sort of replacing it and pushing it away and getting the non-attractive

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,000
because you were told that's what you need to do.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,480
Well, actually, whenever said you need to replace it, you say you need to see it.

42
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,600
You need to see it in relation to that which is attractive.

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,120
So when you're reviewing your body, for example, to get that sense of dispassion because

44
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:22,520
it's all the organs by themselves are not quite repulsive actually and certainly non-attractive.

45
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,040
So that's easily seen, but what it's hard to see is that when you're attracted, either

46
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:34,760
towards gaining physical pleasure, towards pursuing the objects of physical pleasure externally,

47
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,520
you want to see that all of those experiences of centrality, basically, is fundamentally

48
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,800
inseparable from these disgusting organs and fundamentally established upon them so they

49
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,480
can never be apart from them.

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,520
They can never be independent of the repulsive foundations, which means that themselves

51
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,440
can never be really truly attractive.

52
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,360
So a person who is truly experienced dispassion and developed it, for them things are very

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,360
dispassionate and maybe slightly less dispassionate or rather very unattractive and slightly less unattractive.

54
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,240
Sensuality, the beautiful things become slightly less unattractive so you can still recognize

55
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,880
the beauty, but none of it is the attractive beauty they would induce centrality.

56
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,600
It's endlessly less ugly.

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Exactly.

58
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
So it's ugly and less ugly.

59
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Yeah.

60
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
It comes down to that.

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,120
It's ugly and beautiful that you're just trying to kind of revolve around, but in order

62
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:37,600
to see the beautiful as ugly, is you need to see that it's simultaneously and inseparably

63
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,280
bound up with those repulsive aspects that are kind of inseparable from inescapable from.

64
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,120
So that's why once the mind is experienced truly dispassion, that order of which comes

65
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,560
first ugly or beautiful cannot be changed anymore.

66
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,200
The beautiful cannot step outside of ugly ever again and assume its own privileged kind

67
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,040
of sensual existence.

68
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,160
That's how sensuality ceases as well, when it becomes fully enclosed in ugly and you

69
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:14,280
lose entire dispassion for any aspect of sensuality conceivable, possible.

70
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,480
Because in its nature you've seen it's just inconceivable without the basis of ugly and

71
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
such.

72
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,480
It's ugly in itself, unattractive or repulsive.

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:33,960
You see the danger in sensuality, you would have to then see the danger in you.

74
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,360
The danger becomes apparent once this passion has been developed, otherwise you can't grasp

75
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
the danger.

76
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,880
But once you experience this passion in the mind is truly sort of withdrawn from the perversion

77
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,080
of perception which is what sensuality is, perceiving an ugly is beautiful and it sees

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,360
it for what it is ugly and just slightly less ugly, but equally not wanted.

79
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,680
Then you recognize, wow, what a danger it is to actually keep focusing on the less ugly

80
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,600
and regarding is beautiful because it keeps you bound to the entire thing that is subject

81
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,720
to this complete annihilation eventually, sickness, aging and death and then repeat and again

82
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,360
and again.

83
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,680
It's because of that tiny little perversion.

84
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,920
Just because of your tiny little assumption in thinking that sensual, that beautiful

85
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:31,360
objects of senses can exist separate from the repulsive, non-attractive, disgusting

86
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
foundations that they are.

87
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,360
That's why it's important not to keep contemplating the repulsive kind of before or after or trying

88
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,840
to replace the beautiful sensual thoughts with it, you want to see them, so you need to

89
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,280
contemplate but you need to see it at the same time.

90
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,320
So yes, think about the repulsive things of the body so that you can experience this

91
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,560
passion, but then you have to apply or rather maintain that this passion, that's why

92
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,480
perception must learn how to endure, even when sensuality arises whereby you don't

93
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,200
just jump on sensuality and try to get rid of it, because that wasn't what you were doing

94
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
to begin with.

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,520
What you're doing is whether you choose to abandon attending the foundations of that

96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,680
sensuality and give to rise to attending pleasing and like temporarily sort of particular

97
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:29,680
features of it, which is basically how sensual thoughts originate and get maintained.

98
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,640
So you don't want to keep replacing sensuality, you want to see through it.

99
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,480
So all of those things that the disgusting contemplations and so on that the Buddha

100
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,000
was encouraging, amongst the do, need to be seen through the sensual, through the beautiful

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
objects, through the beautiful things.

102
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Not instead.

103
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:57,040
So you're not saying it once you're going, trying to seek out beautiful sights.

104
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,360
Oh no, on the contrary, no, no, no, no, yeah, exactly, well if you are seeking out a bit

105
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,120
of sight, there is no establishment of the right, that means the perception is already

106
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,720
perverted, which means the mind is not seeing, not attending to the roots of this passion,

107
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,160
roots of disgusting aspects of that sensuality, because you don't, you don't need to, you

108
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,280
need to restrain the senses first, fully, stop giving into the habit of seeking pleasure

109
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,960
by default, for these roots to be able to be seen through the a risen sensual prospect

110
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,920
in a form of thought or a possibility or intention.

111
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,360
But if your intention habitually leads you to immediately give in to the action by your

112
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,640
senses and seek out the pleasure, no amount of transparency in through it will be possible

113
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,000
because you just, you just went off, went off with it.

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,960
So yeah, that's something people think, oh, I must expose myself sensuality, but if

115
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,480
you need to prove to yourself that your free from sensuality means you don't know it,

116
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,200
means you doubt it, which means you're not free, if the doubt can enter it, there is

117
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,320
no freedom there.

118
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,320
And in the same sense, in order to be able to seek sensuality even as a proof, it requires

119
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,440
perversion of perception, it requires central perceptions to be established, which means

120
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,440
even if you're seeking out to prove it yourself means you're seeking out of sensuality.

121
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,440
So no seeking out, seeking out whatsoever and then seeing through whatever present, however

122
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,960
it's present, how it will be beautiful it might be, you see it inseparable from those

123
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,720
ugly aspects that you have been contemplating, because they are there.

124
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,640
Because the sensuality, the sensual beauty is actually ugly and disgusting and inseparable

125
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,640
from disgusting things, unattractive things, that's why freedom from sensuality is possible.

126
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,720
If it were truly beautiful and independent, you wouldn't be able to go out of it, but

127
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,600
then it wouldn't be a problem either, you wouldn't have to go out of it, but it's not

128
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
truly beautiful.

129
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,680
It's a mistake based on ignorance, based on sensual craving, based on the fire of lust

130
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,320
and so on, so that's why it's a problem.

131
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,360
That's why pleasure underlying by craving is a problem, pleasure without underlying craving

132
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,840
is not a problem, but there is no sensual pleasure that it's not underlined by desire for

133
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:45,400
more lust and greed and craving.
