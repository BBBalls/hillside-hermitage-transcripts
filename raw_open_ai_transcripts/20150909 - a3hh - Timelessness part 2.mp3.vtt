00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
But then something else is your situation on the general level.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
You see what I mean?

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
You are mindful that you are here in the cave sitting on the floor while they're talking the Dharma.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
But now you can have a thought of you sitting in the cave on the floor talking Dharma.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
And that thought is particular for you now.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
While you're sitting in the cave on the floor talking about the Dharma, which remains general.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
So it can be the same thought.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
You can see it twice or doubly, simultaneously.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
You can see the same thought on the particular level.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
And you can see it on the same thought on a more general level.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
That's immediate in reflection approach.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
But again, it's the same structure, same principle, same generality.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
What you should not do is confuse then the particular things for general and I think they are general.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Because they are particular.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
And if you see them as general, then their general became particular and now something else is general.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Even if it's the same thing.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
Either way, you lose the sight of the general, you lose the sight of the mindfulness.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
It's very unnatural.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Because natural means ignorant.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Natural means going with the grain as the Buddha referred to it.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
But the practice of Dharma goes against the grain.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Against the way of thinking.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
That doesn't mean you kind of go mad and do crazy things.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Just means you start thinking in the opposite direction.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
And this is the opposite direction.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
The most common thing is me, my cup, I want to drink the water.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
But now you start thinking indirectly.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
I can drink this water only because my situation allows it as a possibility.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Water to be drunk.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
So you start bypassing your sense of self.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
You start making it redundant.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Because I want to drink water not.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
The water is possible to be drunk because of the situation.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And that's why you can attend it.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
So it is, my sense of self that comes with this intention, I want to drink the water.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Depends upon that intention, I want to drink the water.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Which is given by this situation that it's not in my control.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
Therefore, my sense of self is something I can't control either.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Which means it's not my sense of self.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
You don't have to define your situation.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You can just know your situation.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Because you are already in.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
All this is given in the example.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
As I said, the situation can be as general as you want, such as unseated.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And you don't even have to say it to thinking.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
You just know already that you are seated.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
So recognizing situation, it's almost like on the level of knowledge.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Because if I ask you, what's your body posture now?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
You will know that.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
You won't have to get up in order to tell me that you were sitting down.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
You'll know your seat.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
So it's already there.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
So you don't need to keep it in the mind.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
But yeah, over defining it means making it, approaching it in particular turns.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Which means you forget about general.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Wait a minute.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
But the way I think, the way I think something about my situation about weight,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
or it becomes particularly important to general.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
It's quite difficult to see.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
No, not to general.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Thinking is particular.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Thinking is particular.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, it can also be general.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Depends what you think.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Depends what how you think.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
In other words, it doesn't mean that particular ceases.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
As I said, particular in return makes the general possible.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
The things that you see particularly, you realize, oh, it's because of this,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
and my situation has a reason.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
But then the particular things are defined as such because of your situation.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
It's like two sticks.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
You can't conceive them separate from each other.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
So even for another general in particular, that all remains the same.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
It's ignorance in regard to the structure, and taking it as mine,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
and everything, that's gone.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
But yeah, of course, yeah, that's how it works.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
It doesn't mean that you go into general and everything in particular disappears.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Impossible.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
It's quite difficult, I don't know.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
But general particular is the five aggregates.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Potugina holds them.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Arun doesn't.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
So general in particular is the structure.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
It's the same in Arun and in Potugina.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Potugina holds it as a result of his ignorance.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So he has great version delusion, nothing else.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Arun doesn't.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So that's a difference.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
This whole relationship of sitting in the room while sitting, talking to you,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
it's the same for Arun or Potugina.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
It's just the Potugina takes it as mine.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
You're welcome.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
And it's because Potugina takes things as mine in regard to hunger or thirst,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
particular or general, he suffers.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Arun doesn't take his mind, he doesn't suffer further.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
For Arun, there's no serve build.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And how could you see anything something in Potugina?

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
You see, everything to me must become general for Arun.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Well, see the point.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
The flowers can drink the water.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
He's only possible for you to attend and go and drink the water

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
because he was available.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
He was possible.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
None of that, that's the same for Arun and Potugina.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
There makes no difference.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
That is indifferent to your sense of self.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
The situation allowed for a drinkable water to be present.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
And then, oh, I'm thirsty and I can drink the water.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
So it makes no difference whether you take it as mine or not.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Because it didn't come from you.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
It came from the general situation.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
How does he feel?

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
If he's thirsty, he feels significance of thirst.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
So then the water will make sense.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
But he knows that the water and the entire situation originates external to him.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Nothing to do with him.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
So whether he drinks the water or not, or while he drinks the water,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
he won't think of me and myself and for me,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
because he understood the entire situation

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
that already holds this particular drinking water experience in it.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
He understood that is not self.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
He's still young, actually very beautiful.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
What makes me still I feel that why is it important to think this situation?

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Because I think whatever it is,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
because whatever you can feel,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
it means appearing as a bubble in the mind,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
whatever appears, I think if all of them,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
if I can see clearly these things,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
my control appears in everything.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Isn't it enough?

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
It's self then. What are you seeing just what's in front of you?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
If these bubbles, if I can see that,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
cannot support the same view.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Okay, you're seeing the bubbles,

08:14.000 --> 08:23.000
but what is overseeing you're seeing?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Means I'm standing outside.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Means you're assuming yourself outside.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
By assuming these things in front of you,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
you put yourself out,

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
which means you don't really include your sense of self there.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So there is seeing, there are bubbles.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
There are bubbles being seen.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So you're seeing everything,

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
but you're not seeing the nature of seeing.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
If I could think that only I can think of myself as a self view.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
This is my self.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
If I can think that these bubbles only I can think,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
they're really good at mind.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Then my mind, I am,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
it's included in these bubbles.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Only because that only could come from the perspective.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Not quite.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
No, no.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
No, see, because when you say,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
the fact that bubbles already arise for you,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
no matter how you think them afterwards,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
a sense of self was already there.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
So you're just managing the situation,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
as opposed to uprooting it.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, but you actually,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I never see any other,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
really appearing as bubbles.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
These are actually coring as mine, I am.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
No, you will not.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
You won't see that.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Because if the sense of self and sense of mind

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
was to appear right in front of you so clearly,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
you wouldn't need a Buddha to become an Arant.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
But then what did some coring as myself?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Well, that depends, really.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
You can call any of the aggregates myself.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And the thing is,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
you expect to find a particular thing

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
that you called myself.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
But as I said,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
my sense of self is never particular,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
is always general.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So, but if using to look at the general level,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
you'll never see the sense of self.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Because you expect to find it on the particular level.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And it doesn't appear there.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
So no wonder you can't find the sense of self anyway.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
But the fact that we can talk about your sense of self,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
means there is something being designated as such.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Something very ambiguous,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
unclear, general, non-particular.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And as such, it is real,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
it is present as a phenomena.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
So you have to start seeing it like that

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
in order to be able to understand it like that.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
But if you're just used to seeing things in front of you,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
bubbles, particular,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
sense of self never appears like that,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
which is why it's sense of self.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
And that's why you can never see it.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
But if you see your general situation,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
which is where sense of self is,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
you see that has fully determined

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
by these particular random bubbles.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Indirectly,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
then you're already,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
like, uprooting your sense of self

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
without directly looking at it.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Because you can't.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Whenever you look directly,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
your sense of self is behind your look.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
That's how it works.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
It means need to see the relation.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
How these bubbles appeared.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Well, no, that's not the relation.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
See, that's the explanation.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
How the bubbles appeared would be an explanation.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And the fact that the bubbles are there

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
means you're in the situation.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
The fact that you're in situation

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
means bubble can appear as bubble.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
Now, sense of self

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
lingers somewhere in between.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But you can never look at it directly

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
because it's always behind your look.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
So then you learn to know

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
where it is without needing to look.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Because looking will hide it.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
It means for me not able to see

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
what I'm calling myself or something.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
No, directly.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Not as a particular thing.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
You can know it indirectly

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
where your sense of self is.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
You can't look at it directly

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
because look comes from the sense of self.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I was feeling that whatever,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
what do I feel inside the body or in the mind?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Those things are actually

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
thinking as mine, myself.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
My feelings, my thoughts, everything.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
These all combine together.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I was thinking, here I am.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Well, even those things.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
The sense of mind is in regard

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
to the things.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
The mind is not in the things.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
So in other words,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
it's your attitude towards certain things

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
that is the attitude of mind.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
So that doesn't mean that everything is yours.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It just means there's some things,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
it's enough for some things

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
to be regarded as mine.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Sense of self is there.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Sense of self.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
So even the sense of mind doesn't appear

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
clearly right in front of you.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
It's also general in regard to

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
particular things that you took as mine.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Attitude.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
What is attitude?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Can you see your attitude particularly?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh, here it is.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
You can't.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
It's an attitude in regard to things.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
So it's a mental phenomenon.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Or just a phenomenon.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
Done.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
But it is always clear.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Everything else.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
It doesn't mean that it's permanent,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
but it means it's in regard to everything.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
So when you're looking at things in front of you,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
you're not seeing your attitude in regard to those things.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
You're just seeing what's in front of you.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And that's why it's wrong.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
You leave your attitude out.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
But your attitude is that which needs to be changed.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Not the things.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Because they were not a problem in the first place.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
So the bubbles, they're all bubbles, whatever.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
But it's a attitude in regard to them

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
that you need to change.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Not them.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
For pututina, always looking at everything

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
to the record.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Based on self view, everything is mine.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
No, no, no.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
No, it's not everything.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
I am.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
But pututina takes his, takes not self with self,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
or takes self with not self,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
or takes self with self.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
But he cannot do,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
what he cannot do is take not self with not self.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Is it something, I'm supposed to be looking at something.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Everything I'm thinking, I am looking at this.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
But maybe he is looking at it.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Well, yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
In a way you can say that.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
But he can think, I am looking at this.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
But the thought of I am looking at this is not his.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
It's not I.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
It's not me.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
There is no conceit.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
That's all gone.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
So then it's just a designation, I am.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I was thinking.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
What do I do?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
What do I do?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Maybe I was thinking, I am doing everything, looking at it.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
No, that's like when you're trying to force the view

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
or already I and this on this.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
But no, you have to find yourself within that situation.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And that's how you abandon it.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Like if you're producing things in front of you constantly,

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
you are doing that, which means that you, which is doing it,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
it's not included there.

15:53.000 --> 16:01.000
That's why I can never work.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
But for producer, it's not a temper, you know,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
you know, the record is, same view is already there.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
The attitude in regard to the most fundamental aspects of the aggregates,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
yeah, it's always the same, which is why it's a producer.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
And when I say the most fundamental, I mean the most general.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
So he might not be taking this particular,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
this particular flask carpet cushion is mine.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
But he's taking the whole general situation.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
His body at least has mine.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Therefore, whatever situation his body ends up being in,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
he'll imply his sense of self in it.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
And whether through for me or not for me or me or both or neither.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
So that's why he needs to be undone in that indirect manner,

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
through undoing the situation.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
To see things actually, generally, in the record something,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I have to put something outside,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
not to see something, like a...

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
No, the same answer.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
You just have to discern it where it is, how it is,

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
without having to move it about in order to understand it.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
To the extent the thing has a reason,

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
that's how and that's where you have to understand it.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
That's discernment.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Discerning what's given.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
The things given by you to discern within that what's given,

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
how, what's important, what's impermanent, and so on.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
It's very new, actually.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
This is the teaching of Venomanyam.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
I don't really know how much this is now.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
I think here it's within the same, same ideas.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
But it's from the sutras.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You didn't invent anything.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
From the sutras?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, of course.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
Well, if you see all of this explanations you can find in the sutras.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Obviously, the sutras being so general,

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
like, you know, Bikobodi calls the sutras to support his three life interpretation.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Because he finds parts, they've nothing to do with it,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
but he's on par, but he would call them for a petition par.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
And then when he needs to, he would ignore the abstract principle,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
just to support the view.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
And the sutras allow that because they're so profound and so general

18:30.000 --> 18:41.000
in the description that actually people can use them, misuse them.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Which is why, like, if you start thinking like this,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
then you can start reading the sutras in this way.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
And then they will read very differently.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Then they will become apparent why, like, one sutra is enough for all of them.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Even before understanding.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Before you were reading sutras in different ways.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah, before I was reading sutras, I had everybody else does.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
Like, kind of wise inspiration, but kind of product of folklore,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
India, long time ago, ancient text type.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
But then I started reading in the Vera.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Well, then I started reading extension philosophy

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
that was making lots of sense in terms of intention, action,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
responsibility, feelings, anxiety, and so on.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Then I started reading in the Vera,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
talking about the sutras in those terms.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
And I realized, wow, you can actually...

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
Yes, you can read it as an ancient sacred text

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
that just produced poetic inspiration.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
But you can also read it as an existential

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
phenomenological description of experience right here right now.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
And if you stop and think which of those two ways,

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
either a romantic inspiration or a phenomenological accurate,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
actual description of your experience,

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
which one of those two is most likely to make an around,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
you realize it's the latter one.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
If you read it as a description of the universal aspects of the experience,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
whether two and a half thousand years ago, whether now,

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
whether two and a half thousand years later,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
it's still the same universal experience.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
You understand it like that?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Oh, yeah, of course.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
All you need is one sutra to become an around,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
if you fully understand it.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Whether it's been spoken two millennia ago,

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
or now, or ten millennia later, just makes no difference.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
It's the same thing spoken.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And that's what the Buddha said when he discovered the Dalma,

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
he realized, oh, it's like finding an ancient path

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
that was already there.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
He didn't invent himself, nothing.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
So that's what I said to people like,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
you know, you don't need to get into all the philosophy

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
and everything that he talks about.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
But at least if you get the attitude towards the sutras from him,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
you can't ask for more.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
And how to read the art approach.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah, it's very interesting.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Yeah, because then you read the sutras

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
and you stop and think about every single sentence.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
Because as I said, you read our consciousness and do I even know

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
putting the sutras in my own terms what consciousness is?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I don't.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
So how can I expect that that which I think consciousness is,

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
is that which the Buddha talks about when he says consciousness?

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
And then you stop and think further.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
And you realize, well, if my thought of consciousness

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
would correspond to the Buddha's thought of consciousness,

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
I would be an other hand, or at least a sutra partner.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But I'm neither of those, therefore,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
when I think consciousness, that's not the consciousness

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
the Buddha talks about.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
So you keep drilling and drilling and drilling.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
And then even if you read this, you come back to it.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
And you read again.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Many times.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
It's very interesting.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
I don't know if I can't explain it in such a way.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
It's very interesting.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, I don't know.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I haven't heard anybody speak.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
So it's different.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
In these 10 years.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
You had no teacher, you said?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
No, no, no.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
No teacher.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
But I haven't even heard anybody resembling

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
this type of approach when they speak.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
This way of thinking.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
So it's not surprising that you have no idea.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Through your experience and through your meditation.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Well, yeah, through experience, through meditation,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
through the sutras, through the pondering and understanding,

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
you get to see where people come from when they talk about it.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
And I haven't really heard anybody

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
even coming remotely from this direction.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
The direction that I was talking about,

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
the direction that's implied in the sutras.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
That doesn't mean that there aren't any,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
but just I haven't heard.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
There are some monks that don't agree with the sutras.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
Some of them say that they are some of them wrong.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Well, yeah, exactly.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Well, that's the thing.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
It was such a long time ago when they were spoken.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
You can't prove, you can't disapprove either.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
So when people come across some parts,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
they can't come to terms with,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
oh, they must have been introduced later.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
It's like, well, yeah.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
How do you feel? Do you agree with this?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I don't care.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
I mean, it's kind of relevant.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I think it's a silly thing to do,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
because unless you're a sotapana,

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
you have no criteria of what's right, what's wrong,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
which is why you're not a sotapana.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Therefore, when you choose to ignore certain parts

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
because you believe that they were introduced or whatever else,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
well, you're following your protrusion as criteria.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
So it's, again, you don't know for sure,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
but to be on the safe side,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
you take it all.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
You accept it all just so that you can practice

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
and hopefully get the right view.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
When you get the right view, then certain things might become more apparent.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Oh, I don't really know whether this came later or not.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
But if there are such parts,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
they won't pertain to the demo.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
It might pertain to some story

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
or some social relationship or something.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
It will not pertain to the four noble truths

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
and the concept, the main concept, is just you won't.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Because if it does, you will know this is wrong.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
This is not the Buddha.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Which is why when you read Mahayana sotras,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
it's not a single Buddha word there.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Near it?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
It's part of stuff.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I read at least the huinei and the six-part chat.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
Six-part chat, huinei and hard sutra and stuff.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
It was just very strange.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
I mean, it's not debatable that it's introduced later

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
by their own teachers and preachers.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
But the thing is, you know,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
there can be things introduced later,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
new arahats coming and teaching in their own terms.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
It will still be the same Dharma.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And if it isn't, it means it's not.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
They're not arahats.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
And you can see that.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
It's not a problem.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
You see that when you are barapai, you eat or not.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
You don't have to disagree in the sutras.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
You must avoid it.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
It depends.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
If they're disagreeing with the key concepts,

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
if they're dismissing the teachers and the body,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
you should dismiss Him.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
You don't have to dismiss His scholarship,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
but His views should be considered.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Again, as I said,

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
You know, needing to be a son of something, if you stop thinking about it well,

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
even as an abstract principle, but it's still a principle within which the whole,

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
the only reason it's abstract is because a person does not see directly.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
So if anything, if you call something abstract principle means

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
that's something you didn't understand, which is why it is abstract.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
It's abstract only in regard to its content, not in its nature.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
So principle is principle.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Oh, that principle is abstract for me because I don't understand it.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
So if everybody starts with this principle and then you have somebody comes

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
and dismisses the principle and gives you a different explanation,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
you should be doubtful of that.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Or if somebody goes even further and blatantly says,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
no, I disagree with that sort of.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Like, some of these sort of, I think that's all wrong.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
Well, you shouldn't waste your time speaking to them then, if they say such thing.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
Because some of these sort of does not pertain to any traditional,

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
any cultural, any product of the ancient India.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
It pertains to the right view and the noble way for path.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
So if somebody dismisses that, well, they're not really following the Buddha's teaching,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
even if they're monks.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah, generally, everybody's teaching if someone doesn't agree with it.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
It's okay.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah, that's different.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
Because what they're not agreeing, they're not agreeing with an interpretation

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
of the Buddha's teaching.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
They don't agree with the view of the Buddha's teaching.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
You see, some are here, they don't agree with it.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Well, no, no, see, that's the thing.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
They might disagree or they might not be able to comprehend all of the things

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
in a bit of a saying.

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
But I think with little effort, they would understand the basic ideas

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
and they would know whether in a way that was or wasn't a sort of department,

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
if they were truly artists.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
But people often dismiss it entirely.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
Well, they're still, they know their putuginers,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
but they don't know that there's putuginers.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
They cannot know what's right, what's wrong.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
I met quite a lot of monks there, senior monks there,

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
who would know, who would openly say, oh, I haven't had anything.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
But they wouldn't stop them from saying what you should do in terms of practice,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
which is a contradiction in terms.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
If you don't know yourself, what you need to do in terms of the right view,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
how can you even conceive teaching somebody else to get the right view?

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
It's just mind-bubbling contradiction that doesn't seem to stop them.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
So then coming from the same place,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
if they come across something they don't like,

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
they don't like the way it was put out, they don't like the way it was taught.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
These pleases them or whatever,

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
such as in the videos books and his views, they'll dismiss it.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
Knowing themselves their putuginers and they have no criteria for the true dismissal,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
they'll dismiss it, which is why they stay putuginers.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Yeah.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah, that's just how it works.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
So as putuginers, you don't know what's right, you don't know what's wrong.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
That's why the element of faith is necessary.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
But that faith should be like govern or guided or directed by intelligence.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
Not just blind faith, but you accept everything called Buddhism,

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
but you discern and you think what is least likely to be wrong.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I don't know what's right.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Everything might be wrong.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
What is least likely to be wrong,

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
and then I'll start putting my effort in that.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
And then if I was a little bit fortunate,

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
if I was intelligent enough, I might have chosen the right thing,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
and with a sufficient amount of effort I could,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
I'll get a confirmation that it's right thing,

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
which is one of the sutras the Buddha would refer to,

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
sort of one as somebody who has a confirmed confidence in them.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.000
Like they were confident, this is least likely the correct thing,

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
and then they had that thought confirmed when they became sort of one.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
So they know, they they know.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
If sort of one, if you become sort of one,

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
everything or faith and everything to the...

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
Well, the faith gets replaced by confidence.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
It all becomes unshakable faith,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
which is not really faith anymore, it's confidence.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
He knows that he knows.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
And he cannot even conceive,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
because the Buddha is the Dhamma.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Dhamma is the Buddha.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
So it's not...

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
It's not that the Buddha is the person,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
or something who happened to say something right.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
No, the Buddha is that teaching.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
So they understood the teaching, they understood the Buddha.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
So that's what it's inconceivable for them to now follow a different teacher.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And when I say a different teacher,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I don't mean another monk who might be teaching the same,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
and then they have, okay, I'll listen to you a bit more,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
because you seem like they did follow Sariputta.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
No, when I say a different teacher, I mean Christian.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Teaching Christian philosophy, Christian views,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
or Western science for that matter,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
because that's almost like religion today, or psychology.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
They wouldn't be able to adopt that,

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
because it's a wrong view.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
The only way they could adopt any other teaching,

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
if it's the teaching that's the same as the Dhamma,

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
it would be the Dhamma.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
It's actually interesting.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Some Christians, they can become Arya, you know?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Not through Christianity, you know?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Not through Christianity.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
I've had a venerable man told me that in the Buddha was Arya,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
what time they were sold upon there was something,

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
and in this life they were born as Christian or something,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
at least in Christian family.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
Then something, anyway.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
No, that makes no difference.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
What view your family holds,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
and what had it that you're born in, that's irrelevant.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
No, what view you hold,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
and what teaching you follow personally to try to understand,

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
that's what matters.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
So somebody can my world be a Christian priest,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
if he ponders on impermanence,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
and suffering, and nature or not self,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
he ponders on Dhamma.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
And if he becomes an Arya,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
he becomes because of the Dhamma,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
not because of his belief in imaginary friend.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
If they become Arya with being the Christian,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
all of those believe that they go...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Well, they would see them as wrong.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Wrong.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Well, not even.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
Like, they would see them as irrelevant.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
Like, the belief in God and everything,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
not as much as it's wrong,

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
but it's just irrelevant.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
It makes no difference.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Obviously, it makes a difference for people who don't know

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
and put their whole life in those beliefs.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Beliefs.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
But if somebody understood the nature of suffering

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
and freedom from it,

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
belief, it just doesn't even apply belief in God anymore.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
I have this country with many people,

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
they believe in astrology and horoscope and everything.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
What's the problem?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Well, it's a superstition.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
It's the most kind of primal attitude towards, you know,

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
the unknown.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
People are superstitious,

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
magic and all kinds of good signs and bad signs.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
It's basically like something people need to do

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
in order to quickly escape anxiety,

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
anxiety of an existing individual.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Because, you know, just being alive already means

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
you're in a parallel situation

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
because you can die at any time

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
and you're absolutely no sane in it.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And just that single thought

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
can freak people out,

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
can make them mad.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
If they really are who.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Like, you just, you couldn't stop it.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Your whole world can end in a second

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
and you can't do anything about it.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
So the immediate response to that

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
is,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
nobody will all be good, I believe.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
God will protect me,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
or Universal Energy will protect me,

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
or my horoscope tell me I'll be fortunate.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Anything like that, just to give you

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
the little grain of hope to overcome it

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
and allows you enough to not look at the anxiety.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Because if you keep looking,

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
you'll go mad.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
And the Buddha did say that.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
He said that if somebody experienced suffering

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
rightly,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
correctly, that anxiety

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
opened clear without any cover

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
of the views and superstition

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
and all sorts of other religions,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
there are only two outcomes.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Mental derangement,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
or search.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
A noble search

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
they will bring that pain

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
and if somebody is strong enough to not go mad,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
it would result in them looking for a medicine

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
that can remove this pain.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
So that's the state the person needs to be in.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
It needs to be open to the extension

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
anxiety to such an extent

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
that there is a risk of madness,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
but that means there is also

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
a possibility of the right search.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
Doesn't mean the person actually has to go mad.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
But that means the person has to stop

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
covering it up through superstition,

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
through horoscope,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
through empty beliefs,

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
through magic,

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
and so on.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Mental weakness.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Mental weakness.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Which one?

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
The astrology.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Good.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Good.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
When he...

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
When he got...

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Oh yeah, the suspicious signs.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Well, he didn't refuse it completely

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
in terms of...

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
The divine interventions.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
So, let's say,

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
can't say the truth.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
What do they say?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
It comes through.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Sometimes.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Sometimes.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
But it's always 50-50, isn't it?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
So, it means five out of ten

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
can always get it right.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Because I say this will happen,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
or that will happen.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Well, one of the thought comes,

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
will happen.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
So, I have 50% of chance

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
of being right.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
The Buddha never dismissed that,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
but he never,

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
ever used it as a...

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Like, in reference to the pertain

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
to the court of the teaching

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
and feelings of a censor

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
or whatever else.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
So, that also...

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Like, back to the question,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
well, how did he use it then?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
In what sense?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Whether it was like a real divine.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Like, there are people who could,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
even back in the day,

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
who could develop like supernatural abilities,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
and they could see a future destination

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
based on the current actions you're doing.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
And then,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
there are people who can see

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
or two or three next destinations

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
based on the current actions you're doing.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
There are people who can see ten.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
So, yeah.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
And then, if they say,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
well, this is your...

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
like...

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
future projection,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
then that's true.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
But again, it's not set in stone.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Because if you change your behavior,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
you can change your future outcome.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
Like, with the current set of mental...

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
determinations and things you do,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
and whether actions are wholesome and unwholesome,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
you are heading to heaven.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
But if that changes,

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
if you start misbehaving with doing some unwholesome stuff,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
you won't be going to heaven.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
And that's what the Buddha said.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Sometimes people see only one life ahead.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
And then they say,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and then they see somebody here,

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
misbehaving.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
But they see his next life is heaven.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Then they see somebody behaving,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
but they see his next life is also heaven.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
And then they say,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
oh, makes no difference whether you behave,

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
or you misbehaved,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
you're reborn in heaven.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
But then another person comes and says,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
five lives are ahead.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
And then he says,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
well, yeah, he might be in the heaven next life.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Because actually in the previous life,

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
he did some good stuff.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
But next four lives are misery.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
The one who behaves,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
all five will be heaven.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
And then he says,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
no, it matters how you behave,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
whether good or bad.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
So even those views are limited,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
but they all pertain to the extent of,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
like, nature of samsara,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
what might be ahead of you,

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
and so on,

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
not to the way to escape it.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Which is what the Buddha was concerned about.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Because if you're an Arant,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
that's it.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
No matter.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
And I think he was slightly mocking them,

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
but he was also proving a point.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
There was that divine,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
he would do this divine divination.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
He would look at the skull.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
They would give him a skull for that person.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
And he would tap on it,

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
and do some things.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
And they say,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
he is reborn in such and such place.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
And I think there must have been something,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
he might have had some of the abilities

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
to see in the future,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
which doesn't mean nothing.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
But Ujjana can see future reverts.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
It's no salvation.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
It's just,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
if I tell you tomorrow,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
you're most likely be home.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
In 10 years,

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
you might be next life,

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
you might be some,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
like, at such and such place.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's within the same nature of things.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Like, if I tell you,

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
in five minutes,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
you'll do this,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
and in, you know,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
five hundred lifetimes,

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
you'll do that.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
It's a greater on a scale,

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
but it's the same thing.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
So when they brought this skull

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
to this man of a monk,

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
who died, who was an Arant,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
he tapped it,

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
and then he was confused,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
and then he kept tapping it,

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
and he couldn't,

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
he couldn't see anything.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
And it's like,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
well, that's because he's not reborn anyway.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
Because that's exactly what I'm talking about.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Yes, I really do.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Well, yeah, the thing is,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
but the problem is,

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
people don't take you to like that.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
They take it as a,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
as a setting stone divine,

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
like, completely blessed.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Oh, I'm blessed because I was told,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
no,

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
at the time when you were told,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
if that person who told you,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
could truly see it,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
you were having it at the heaven,

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
the destination.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
That's because,

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
back then,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
your behavior was good.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
But they don't tell you that.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
They just tell you,

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
you go to heaven,

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
and that's it.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
I spent my rest of my life thinking,

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
I go to heaven,

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
no matter what I do.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
And that's exactly what Christians,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
what they've been doing,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
you know, the crusade,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
the wars and stuff.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
You go plundering,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
raping, murdering, stealing,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
stealing with the belief

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
of you going to heaven,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
because you were told.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
But actually,

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
even that depends on you right now,

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
actions.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
So you might,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
you will be better off if somebody tells you,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
if you behave wholesomely,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
if you don't give in to anger,

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
don't give it to greed,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
don't give it to any aversion,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
you're most likely going to heaven.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
And you don't need any special,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
natural powers to know that,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
you just need a simple intelligent reflection

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
which I started this talk with,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
when somebody thinks,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
well, whether I miss behave or not,

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
if there is a future life or not,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
it's better to behave.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
You're better off if somebody tells you that,

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
because then,

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
for the rest of your life,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
you'll be doing things rightly

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
with that thought of a good river

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
and the Buddha did say that, actually.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
He said,

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
behaving properly,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
keeping the seal and virtues

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
goes to more fortunate destinations.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
That's better to be told,

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
then if somebody just tells you,

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
oh, yes, you're heading to heaven

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
and you take it for granted.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
And if they truly knew that you were heading to heaven,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
they probably wouldn't just tell you,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
you're heading to heaven.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
You will tell you,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
you're heading to heaven,

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
if you keep behaving properly like you're doing now.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
But unless you hear that,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
then be a bit more doubtful,

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
just in case.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Again, even if they're right or not,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
you can't tell,

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
so it's better to be on the same side.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
So that's how the Buddha approached you.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It doesn't mean there's absolutely nothing to it,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
but whatever it is,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
it still depends on what you do right here right now.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
So it doesn't really mean much.
