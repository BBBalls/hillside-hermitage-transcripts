00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
So I feel distracted most of the time, and my mind can never really settle down.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
So how can I calm my mind down?

00:17.000 --> 00:27.000
The first step is putting yourself in the calmer environment.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
In other words, no matter how strong your resolve is to calm your mind,

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
if you are in the middle of interaction, engagement with others, with duties, with noise, visuals, you won't become.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
So the wisdom lies in preventing these things from disturbing your peace,

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
so you want to see it ahead before you are in such an environment.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Or if you already are, you want to see that it's necessary, not just beneficial.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
If you want to calm your mind, it is necessary to step outside of that environment, even temporarily.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
So you want to calm down the circumstances around you, isolate yourself more from it.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
Then, on the basis of that, you can start practicing mindfulness

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
and basically trying to understand what makes calm mind calm.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
That's how you get the knowledge, and that's how you calm your mind.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
You're not in the midst.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
No, no, of course not.

01:28.000 --> 01:37.000
Later on, obviously, when your mind is calmer and when you are stronger,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
then you might end up in circumstances that are not calm but remain unaffected,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
but not until your mind grew out of it.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
Imagine like, I don't know, you catch some infectious disease.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
And the first step is to get out of that environment,

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
because the environment is infecting you and just causing you to be constantly sick.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
So then you have to spend a certain amount of time in a non-infected environment.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
And then when you cure, you develop resistance, then you can go back, if you have to, to the infected environment.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You won't be affected again.

02:10.000 --> 02:23.000
But it's the same if you want to calm down your mind and develop it.
