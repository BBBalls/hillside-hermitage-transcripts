1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
How can I satisfy all my desires?

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,760
By overcoming the nature of desire.

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,760
It's very much related to the previous question that you had about suffering.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Basically, what people deem to be satisfaction of their desire is the result of the desire.

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,760
So by pursuing what you think satisfaction is, you cannot possibly satisfy the desire in the sense of making it go away.

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:01:03,760
It only covers it up and feeds it more, because the desire is rooted in your mental attitude.

7
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,760
Which means if you were to remove the desire from its roots, there won't be anything there to satisfy.

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:19,760
There will be no pressure for you, no burden for you to have to chase and reach this goal and satisfy this displeasing feeling of an unsatisfied desire.

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,760
But you can't, that's what people don't realize, you can't satisfy the displeasing feeling of a non-satisfied desire.

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,760
You can only cover it up with a pleasing feeling of a non-satisfied desire.

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Desire remains unsatisfied.

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,760
The goal of desire is not to be satisfied, the goal of desire is to perpetuate its own nature of being a desire.

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,760
That's why whether you're resisting pain or giving in to pleasure, you're maintaining the nature of your desires.

14
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,760
So you remain bummed by it.

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,760
So if I want to go on holiday today, I can't, I want to go on holiday to the Caribbean or something.

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Yes, you can either suffer because the circumstances are displeasing and you're trying to change them,

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,760
or you can remove your desire to go to the Caribbean and then you're at peace.

18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Because you don't want to go into first place.
