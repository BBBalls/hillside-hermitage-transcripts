00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
So how's your meditation going?

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
I got a couple of emails about the thoughts.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
It's very, I'll show you what it's contemplative.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
The thing is, actually before meeting you,

00:24.000 --> 00:33.000
or other Saturdays, or it's told me that it's very important to reduce the time of thinking.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, I got myself many times for people.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
But I understand actually what you explain,

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
because if I try to control something,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
it means, actually, based on something, I need to control,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
based on self-view, actually, because of that,

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
and I try to control it.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
So maybe that is...

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I understand it, but...

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
The only thing with that is,

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
for as long as you don't think that everything is in your head,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
so to speak, you know, at some of the speed,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
because they are, it's all in my head.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
It's not, it's real.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Anything that appears, through any of the senses,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
it appears as a phenomenon,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
which means, from that point of view, it is mental.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
It pertains to the mind.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
So even things that you see, objects around you,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
again, they're real where they are,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
and they are material, but you know them for what they are,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
you perceive them for what they are,

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
all of that has this founding mental aspect.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
So obviously, you have things that are more mental,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
so to speak, like when you think about your thoughts,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
about your past, future, some,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
and then you have the immediate experience of the things

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
that you're seeing, hearing, touching, tasting.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
None of those things would be known,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
if that's already not a form of thought,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
which is why all of the five senses,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
they meet in the mind, which acts as a six,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
in that regard.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
So I just wanted to clarify that,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
because sometimes people get,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
oh, it's all in my head, it's all my thoughts,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
and then they use that to dismiss

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
real things around them.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Oh, it's not real, because just in my thought,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
well, your thoughts are very real.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
And things here, things here,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
things in between, that's all very real.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
It's just a thinking on that properly,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
could help people overcome the assumption

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
of the external world,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
exists, and then I am in it,

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
and then I can think in regard to it.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
But the fact that you can even designate

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
the external world,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
in, well, whichever designation you choose,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
the fact that you can do that means

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
it's already perceived, somehow,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
and as such, it's actually a thought.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
It's a dharma, like a phenomenon,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
which means it's not really an external then.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
It's external aspect,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
it's only relative to something which is

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
maybe less external,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
but fundamental, there is no external world that you,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
that it's independent of you,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
because in that case, you wouldn't be even conceiving it,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
you couldn't.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Is it that before I remember,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
if I see the tree,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
my consciousness is out there?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, that's definitely, like, see,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
the tree outside is real,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
when you look at it, and it's there.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
But again, the designation there,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
the designation tree,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
all of that, it's already perceived

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
on the level of the mind, and that's what the consciousness is.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
So in that sense, you can say, yes,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
it's more correct to say the consciousness

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
is with that matter of that tree

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
than in your head,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
that's just a result of it.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Is it important that some people

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
they say that,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
suppose, if I keep thinking,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
it's about the tree or something,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
but actually, your teaching is actually,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
with maintaining the mind

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
for the supplement,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
maintaining the mind for this on the body,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
for the posture, something,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
why are we mindful of the body itself?

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And then, I should be mindful of the other thing.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
It's quite an opposite.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Difficult assumption.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Attention, use your stays on one object.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Well, the attention usually goes after something.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
So the point is to learn how to be mindful of the experience

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
as a whole, all of it.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
No matter what particular things you're attending,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
whether it's a tree,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
or it's a cup, or it's whatever,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
that's all particular,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
but you want to remain mindful on the general level

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
of the experience as a whole,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
which is why I would refer to it as a mindful of the background,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
mindful of the peripheral.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Because it's not what you're attending,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
it's the negative in regard to that.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, it's the background of that thing

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
that you're fully attending right now.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And because it is still present,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
in a form of a background,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
you can say it's slightly less present

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
than the thing that you're fully attending.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
But it's still present.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
So mindfulness means training your mind

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
to recognize the degree of the presence of that background,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
and not interfere with it.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
So you get established upon it.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And then you remain mindful of the background,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
no matter what particular things

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
that are rising and how powerful they are,

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
or they might be.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
It means why reading the book or something,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
you are always aware of.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Okay, you look harder when you read the book,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
because reading a book means reading the ideas,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
the thoughts,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
you have to think about it.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So it requires more of your attention.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
So if you read the book,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
yeah, okay, read the book.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Focus on what you're reading in the book.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
But it's more like,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
if you're doing things that are not necessarily

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
requiring 100% of your attention,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
sweeping the leaves,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
washing the dishes, or whatever,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
you can be mindful of your experience

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
in regard to what you're doing right there and then.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
So writing a complex letter

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
would require most of your attention to it.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Still, you can be mindful in regard to that,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
but you don't have to worry about too much.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Like, oh, I lost my mindfulness.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I think, well, you didn't really.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You just diverter your attention more

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
to the thing that you willingly mind

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
from it decided to do beforehand.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
So then that's absolutely fine.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's not like if you're passing

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
that which is actually impossible,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
that you can maintain constant sort of awareness

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
of the present or it's a contradiction in terms.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It doesn't work like that.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Because even that idea of the constant present moment

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
has a reason on the background

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
that you're completely not seeing.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
And then you're just expecting everything

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
to exist to the same degree right in front of you.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And when it doesn't, oh, I lost my mindfulness.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
I wasn't the mindfulness to begin with.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
How do you understand the word

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
of attachment?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
How do you explain the word of attachment?

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, I am super-dana.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I translate it as assumption.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
How do you...

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Is it something like a usually people's

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
speaker or something dangerous?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
But attachment means something

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
thinking about something.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, it's a bit more subtle.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
It's subtle than that.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You're attached to things

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
when you take them to be yours.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
No.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Even that background I'm talking about,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
like the background that appears

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
like the less your experience as a whole,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
that's already what you've taken to be yours.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
The basis for your everyday experience,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
which is the experience of your senses

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
in regard to the world,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
your eye, your ear, your nose,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
that's already taken as mine.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
So even if things are right in front of you,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
you're not necessarily yours.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Oh, like, I don't know,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
this torch that I'm holding is not mine.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Well, all of the senses that I'm using

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
to experience are being helped by me,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
which means in that way,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
in that experience of that torch,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
which is in mundane levels, not mine,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
it's still mine,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
because I took it through the senses.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
And then always the things that

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
yours, even on a mundane level,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
they're even more yours.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
But if you undermine that,

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
if you recognize that you can't actually own

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
the senses to begin with,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
it's impossible.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Not knowing that you can't own it,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
you take up the ownership.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
You find out that you can't own it,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
you don't own it.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So it's mutually exclusive,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
it's either or you either own it

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
or you don't.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So you want to not own it,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
and you can do that only by fully understanding

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
that you could not have owned them,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
in other ways.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And that means whatever,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
then you experience an account of those senses,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
you can't even conceive that to be yours,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
or to imply your sense of self,

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
or to be for you, or anything like that.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
In the case of Arya,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Arya, that they have,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
they don't have,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
they have some attachments still,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
but they don't have any save of you.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
What kind of attachment is it?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Well, it's,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
well, as the similar in the synthesis,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
like, imagine there is a poisonous arrow

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
stuck in your flesh,

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
that's sort of still oozing poison,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
still making the whole wound,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
in fact, in the sun.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
So the first thing is to take that arrow,

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
take out that source of poison.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
So when you take that out,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
you can say, okay,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I'm further poisoning of the wound.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
The source is taken out,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
but it will still take some time,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
until the poison that is still inside,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
kind of,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
evaporates, this disappears,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
until the wound heals.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
So that's basically what a sacred is.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Somebody who has taken out,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
that poison is dead,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
or ignorance,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
but it will take some time now,

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
depending on how hard he applies himself,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
how carefully he attends to his wound.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It might not take long,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
but it might take longer,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
if he is not dead careful.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
But either way, there is no more doubt,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
there is no more poison coming in,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
which means sooner or later it will heal.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
It will clear itself out.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
So are you,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
when they see something,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
he never thinks,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
that's his,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
but he has no identification,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
basically.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Well, it depends, really.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
There is a, like,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
for someone, he is free from the self-view,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
which means

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
he still possesses a degree of,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
let's say, attachment

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
in regard to things around him and so on.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
But overall,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
he can never, ever again,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
assume that his sense of self

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
exists independently of his own experience,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
which is usually what Buttigiegna thinks.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Not even so clearly,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
but the assumption is that

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
your self is independent of your five aggregates.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It's independent of your body,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
if you mind, it's independent of everything.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
It's permanent.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Well, that view is completely gone

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
for a sort of one,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
which means he can't even conceive that anymore.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
He knows that whatever it is there,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
he has a reason and such,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
it will come to cease.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Even if it's his current sense of self,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
that he's still not quite extinguished,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
his conceit and so on,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
he knows, even that,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
there is a permanent,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
and he won't stay forever,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
which means he does not take even that

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
as ultimate, as eternal.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But it will take time

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
until that,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
one more particular level

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
these things clear themselves out.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
And if he makes the better quality effort,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
more effort,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
he will get there quicker.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
What do you think is independentism?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Dependent organization?

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
No, that's completely not even seen.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
If you ask an everyday person

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
about the sense of self or whatever,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
nobody will doubt that they are.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I am.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Most of them probably won't be able to tell you what they are,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
but the sense of self is undeniable.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
And the degree that they have taken

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
that undeniable sense of self for granted,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
makes it almost feel as if it's completely independent

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
of anything you're experiencing,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
whether feeling perception intentions

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
it just feels entirely

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
myself is kind of myself.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's the same self.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And that is a standard out of one,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
that is a view where you think

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
that your sense of self exists independently

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
of your mind, of phenomena, of your experience,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
of things that are rising in positive,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
just don't even see the connection between the two.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
So recognizing connection,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
recognizing that no matter what sense of self,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
no matter how ambiguous,

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
how well-established, how undeniable it is,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
it's still a thing that you can talk about,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
which means it exists as such.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
It exists as an ambiguous,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
undeniable vague peripheral general sense of self,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
but it's real as such,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
and you start recognizing it on that level,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
which means you start recognizing it for what it is.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
And when you see that it's just another reason thing,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
like other reason things,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
it slowly becomes apparent that,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
yeah, that too is subject to impermanence

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
and because it's subject to impermanence,

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
it cannot possibly be my eternal self.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
I think actually very contemplate on this too.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Actually, I think this is something of what you are realizing,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
or the picture, I think,

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
that itself taking, of course,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
everything up here in the mind,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
or the thought, I think,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
call the picture as taken as self,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
and something like not something like a self-exit,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
something separated,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
not that kind.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I think maybe,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
whatever you are realizing,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
or the picture is just taken as self.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
I'm thinking that everything is in my control.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
That's the meaning of self,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
but I think you're in that division.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah, well, all of those pictures,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
all of those stories are arising,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
they are arising in regard to a background.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And that's for your sense of self-exit.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
So if you're not mindful,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
if you're not recognizing background,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
to the extent that it is a background,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
means you're taking it to be yourself,

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
and as such, whatever arising that arises for yourself.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
So even if you're not necessarily thinking this is me,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
this is my arising for me,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
in front of me,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I can see that I can think about it,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I, and those remains,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I always remains the center of that experience.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
But if you see that even that I,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
is another thing that has a reason.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
On that level of that background,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
that's a different story, because if you see it as a background,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
you'll see, oh, well,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
that background is only background in regard to something

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
that it's right in front of you,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
which means background is determined by that thing.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
And vice versa,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
background determines the actual,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
because it can only arise,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
something can only arise directly,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
based on the peripheral bases.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
So it's mutual determining,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
and you realize, well, whatever,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
yourself goes,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
it will be either here or there.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
There is no in between or the third place that you don't know.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
It's either the background,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
because both of these things

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
mutually determine each other,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
which means none of them can remain standing on their own.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And if that is the case,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
there is no room for the self,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
which is usually the implication of

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
being able to stand by itself alone.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
You mean the background,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
still in standing,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
so you mean the rec as a receiver,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
all the things, what do you mean?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
You can call it a chair, yeah, you can call it.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
You can just say it's a background,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
because it's a background.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
The general ambiguous less defined thoughts,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
the domain of those,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
that's a background.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
If you like, when people start using the terms,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
like the witness,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
the observer, the receiver,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
then already implies

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
that they have taken that very much

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
to be their self.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Because background is not witnessing anything.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Background is a background.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Background is only a background,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
because it's not foreground.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And then which is foreground,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
is a foreground, because it's not background.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
And then you realize that,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
you recognize that all the possibilities

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
of your current foreground,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
that's all they need in the background.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
The new things you can attend

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
based on the current,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
things that you've been attending,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and so on.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
So that way you can't create anything,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
you just find things already there

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
or reason in that background,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
which determines what's right in front of you

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
because you can attend it,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
as something that, as there isn't,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
on account of that background.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
But another way it also works as well,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
because when you attend something directly

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
right in front of you,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
that defines what,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
what you're attending is that,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
which is not the background,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
which means,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
in relation to that,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
everything else is the background.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
So that's what Niano Riro is talking as well.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
The actual determine is the peripheral,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
so it refers to the background

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
or the general experience as a negative experience

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
in regard to the positive thing you're attending.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
But negative is determined only by the positive,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
by not being positive,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
hence the negative.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
And positive is determined by that negative as well,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
by not being that negative.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
So that's why anything

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
can become positive,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
downright in front of you,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
or the negative form of determination.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
And if the aggregate,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
it all depends on how you're attending it.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Well, I contemplate sometimes,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I just feel like,

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
usually, this body is considered

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
like a prop container,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
and you need to do things arising in the mind.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
And just this whole picture,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
it just taken itself,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
you've got this canister,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
why this general peripheral,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
these two things should be separated.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Well, you're trying to separate them,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
you're trying to separate them

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
on a direct actual level,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
which means that's not really

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
the background I'm talking about.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
When you start comparing

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
all actual and peripheral,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
those are actually both actual for you.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Because peripheral is only that

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
which you're not attending.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
The background of your attention,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
right there and then,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
which means if you want to look at it

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
with your attention,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
it just becomes another actual.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And something else now,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
is that which you're not looking at.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
So it's learning how to see that

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
without having to directly look at it.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
How to proceed with it?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
It can happen.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, you can, it's possible.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And that's what Yonisomanasika means.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
The proper attention,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
depending on how you translate it.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Yonisom means the womb,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
so usually your attention

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
pulls you out there

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
at whatever you're attending.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
But it does, it's almost like a formal direction

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
between, it has been directed.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And that place of origin

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
where that attention came from,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
that's something people know mindful

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
because mindful of,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
because that's the background of what they're attending.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
That's the negative.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
So in the same sense,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
your eye cannot see itself.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
But you will, you can discern it

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
and know that it's there

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
based on the things that you see.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Eye, anything, sights.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
So in the same sense,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
the fact that you're already

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
find your attention attending things,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
you can know it's roots.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
You can know where that direction came from.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
There is no solid source

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
that emits attention.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Not knowing that there is no solid source

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
that emits this attention

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
is basically why people assume

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
that there is a solid source,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
which is a sense of self.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Always, no matter what culture,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
what background people are,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
whenever there is a sense of self,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
it will always be the point of origin

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
of my attention, my intention,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
my will, my volition.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
That's inseparable from the sense of self.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
But if you were to see

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
that actually there is no solid point

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
of it, it's just the direction.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Kind of almost infinite

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
in both directions.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Come from a solid point.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
You're just finding there attending.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
And then attending this is then attending that.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
So you can start to discern

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
the origins of their direction

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
in a sense of the background

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
of what's being attended

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
by there and then.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And that's what you only see

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
when a secara is.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Recognizing things on a more general level

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
while you're attending something else.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Directly.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And that recognition

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
can come

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
like with that attention.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
So to speak.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
As I said before, if you

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
are attending something

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
and then just

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
you're aware of the background

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
to some extent.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
But then if you look at it directly,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
it's not the background anymore.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It's another direct thing.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
So you have to learn how to see it very thoroughly,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
how to see without moving your sight,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
without having to look at it.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm aware of that already.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
It's already in front.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Well, not necessarily.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
It's in front when you attend it.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
So you have to learn how to be aware of it.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Because you are aware of it.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
You don't agree.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Everybody is.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
That's how intentions operate.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But you have to learn how to remain aware

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
without needing to attend it.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Or in this case,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
over-attended.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
In which means basically

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
what's kind of extracted from that background

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
and now it's being fully attended.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
So that's what the body posture

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
and some of these things are inherently

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
almost always in the background.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
And establishing mindfulness upon that

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
will mean you're establishing mindfulness upon the background.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
It's not as much

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
as a container

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
for your experience.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
As you said, it's more

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
a necessary random cause

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
for your experience.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
The body,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
bodily organs, just the living body,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
it's there in the world.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Same as every other object you can see.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
It's a particular,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
it's the most specific object

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
because it has an nature

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
to be the reason for your experience as a whole.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Like, if there is no living body,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
there's nothing you can experience.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And you can't even conceive experience

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
without your living body.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
But then the living body is

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
an object in the world.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It's just a part of matter for great elements.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It's just there, a subject

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
to elements, subject to aging,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
to getting sick to die.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Subject to everything.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Just as you know, the stone is subject to whether

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
the animal is subject to other.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
It's just out there.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Yet it is the thing because of which

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
your whole experience is there

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
and you know it,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
whichever way you know it,

23:31.000 --> 23:31.000
including your body.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
I think because the body is already there,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
is that because of which

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
you're able to designate things

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
including the body.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Sometimes I feel that there might be some meaning

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
that some, of course,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
that's actually quite natural,

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
but sometimes I contemplate.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Sometimes we always use something

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
like reacting to some outside

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
of the people.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
But suppose some people,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
if someone tells me something

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
and if I get angry,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
actually everything is happening within.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Nothing to do with others.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
But sometimes I lose mindfulness

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and then I feel that person is wrong.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Not my fault.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
He is a one problem that it's something to me.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
But he contemplates

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
everything is happening within our mind.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Just reacting to it.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Well, it doesn't really matter where it is happening.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Well, matters is that you are affected

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
by what's happening.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Things can happen inside,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
it can happen inside, outside,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
it can happen inside and outside.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
The point is they are happening

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
and you are affected by that.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
So that's what you want to be concerned with.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Not where it's happening,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
how, why,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
what reasons.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
You want to be concerned with the fact

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
that you are affected by whatever

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
it's happening.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
And you can eventually overcome that,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
but again,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
by learning how to not exclude

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
things out of your experience,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
whether direct, whether peripheral,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
you have to develop mindfulness

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
of your experience as a whole.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
So if there is the experience of unpleasant person

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
telling you something offensive, unpleasant

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
and you are emotionally upset

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
on account of that,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
well, all that is already one experience as a whole.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
There is the living random body

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
in the world

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
that happens to be closest to you

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
because of which you are what you are

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
and you are able to hear this person speak

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
and think on account of it

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
and get upset.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
And that's all simultaneous

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
because for as long as that living body

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
there is present,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
means your whole experience

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
will stand on it.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
And you can be distracted here.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Okay.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
For as long as your experience

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
for as long as the living body is present,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
while it's present,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
the whole domain of the senses,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
thoughts,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
interaction with others, all that will stand.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
If there is nobody,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
none of this can stay even for a second longer.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
It's a single ten years.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
So start seeing it like that.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
Eventually you will start recognizing

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
inherently that you're not able to hold,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
you're not able to,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
because that random body there,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
it's clearly not in your control

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
and you don't possess that.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Yet it is the reason of your experience.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Which means that,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
which means that

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
the very foundations

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
of your experience

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
are inaccessible to you.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
So that means that your whole experience

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
equally cannot be yours.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Including your pollution,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
your intention,

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
anything that closes associated to the sense of self,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
you see that is fundamentally undermined

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
by the fact that

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
you're in no control over the four great elements,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
they're basically the reason for,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
for the shape of your body,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
functionality of your body,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
life associated with conscious and spirit,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
that's removed,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
all of which is gone.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
So it's not about addressing,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
sorting out the person that upset you or anything,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
just surmounting the whole picture,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
and then in order to discern that,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
actually,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
this could not have been yours to begin with.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And that's the whole point.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Then you will not be affected by whatever arises.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Even if it's you,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
not a horrible experience,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
sometimes they're really worried about it as soon as.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
But the other hands, they were not affected by it.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I think,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
but in the case of Pututana,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
how it is, sometimes it's important

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
to the, like,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
choosing the thinking,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
the content,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
something has to choose.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Otherwise, I wish sometimes,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I believe I keep thinking about the tree or something.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And if I keep thinking about the tree or something.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Well, what you should do then,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
you should start thinking about yourself,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
thinking about the tree,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
or thinking about yourself doing this,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
or thinking about yourself,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
thinking something else.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Don't just think that,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
or do that.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
That's how you start developing mindfulness.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Seeing yourself do things.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Seeing yourself think things.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
What that's been seen

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
will be recognized.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Oh, this is just another thing that I am seeing.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And as such,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
it's a reason phenomena,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
which means he's subject to all of those,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
it's subject to impermanence,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
suffering,

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
and therefore it cannot be taken itself.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
But you have to keep seeing it like that,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
because the tendency

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
for the sense of self is to be,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
a privileged position in regard to your whole experience.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Which means,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
you might see it as a thought,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
you might see it as a consequence,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
you might see it as a phenomena,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
but it's always assumed to be more.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
But by constantly seeing yourself doing things,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
you're getting more familiar with it,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and being more familiar,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
you're seeing it clearer,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
and you realize there isn't anything more to this.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
How can you be,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
how can you start assuming consciousness

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
that are,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
how can you be aware of consciousness?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
You can't. You can't be aware of consciousness,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
because it's your contradiction in terms.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
But you can discern,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
you can know that consciousness is there,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
as that direction I was talking about

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
in regard to the attention.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
So recognizing the nature of direction

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
means recognizing the nature of consciousness.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
And consciousness is out there,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
with that random matter.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
It's that random matter

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
that's the post-consciousness

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
that your life is here known for what it is.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Usually people assume, again,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
comes through that directionality

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
of the sense of self

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
as being the source for, you know,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
the me-speaking,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
thinking, doing things and so on.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
But basically, whether it's me here,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
things out there, younger,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
all of that is already there together

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
because of that conscious body.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Which means even the sense of space

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
is secondary.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
Here, there, here and there.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Sorry, here and younger, here and younger.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
All of that is already given there.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
And that there is that background

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I'm talking about.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
So it's not here, in here,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
as opposed to the objects around me,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
both are actually already there,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
given, and known as thoughts

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
as representation, as dama,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
whatever you want to translate it.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
Actually, if I see that I think that

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
the B-personal, that kind of practice

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
actually is mistaken

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
because actually there is something

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
like a thinking with this,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
some teachers, they teach

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
like a B-mindful with the movement

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
of the body.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
But then like a drawing the right between

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
this body and the outside.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
But it's already mistaken there.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
It will just be reinforced

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
in the same mistake you began with.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Not just you don't want to be

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
drawing the line in between,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
but you don't want to actually

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
be focusing constantly

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
on what's right, what's your

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
what's actual, what's actual.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Because the harder you try to focus on that,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
the more oblivious of the background

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
you will be. You will not be seeing it.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Which means

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
less and less foundation for mindfulness.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Which it's not accidental

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
that all the people

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
will seriously get into the B-personal,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
intense, very wonder.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Because it's just you

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
constantly just trying to catch

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
you, trying to see it.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
And I was just saying to you there

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
that the similarly in the

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
sutras where the Buddha said the person

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
without the right view, he mismeditates,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
premeditates, overmeditates,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
undermeditates, says it's like a

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
jackal waiting by the bins

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
for the mouse to come out

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
or bird waiting for the fish.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
You're just praying, praying, praying

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
just waiting for it

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
as an animal

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
which is hunting.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And that's a completely wrong attitude.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
It's completely directed out there.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
There is no background. There is no seeing yourself

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
waiting for a mouse to come out of the bin.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Because if you go,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
you will recognize, well,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
whether we're looking for a mouse or

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
whether it's after the element.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
The point is to see myself what I'm doing.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
And that's how you can also start distinguishing

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
wholesome and unwholesome.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
By unwholesome things you don't really

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
think about and maybe later.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
But if you get used to seeing

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
yourself doing things,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
thinking things, feeling things,

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
whatever,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
you will then always have that

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
like an extra space

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
to whatever has a reason

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
from which you can have a clear

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
point of view.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
You can see that, well, yeah,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
no matter how much I'm pulled or whatever,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
this seems inherently unwholesome.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
So I think there is nothing to worry about

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
something, some people,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
even just reading the book or some people,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
they worry that people too much,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
like getting absorbed in it and...

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Why would you worry? Because that random

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
body, living body,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
paid with consciousness is already there.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Whether you're reading the book or not,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
it's already there.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
So you just have to learn how to maintain that knowledge

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
without the need to be constantly

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
bringing it to your mind.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
What do you mean?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
The knowledge of your

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
random living body there,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
which is the reason for your whole experience

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
of reading the book.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
That knowledge is really,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
it's a real thing. It's a base for mindfulness.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Because it's the right knowledge.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
It pertains to the things as they are.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
If you know it,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
you don't have to keep asking

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
yourself or reminding yourself,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
whether you know what you have to do

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
that in the beginning.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
You have to do that in the beginning.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
But later on, you don't.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
The knowledge is there.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
That's what I mean. In the beginning, you will have to

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
stop doing whatever you're doing

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
in order to remind yourself

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
of the order of mindfulness.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
But you do that only so that,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
okay, now reminding myself,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
now let me continue doing what I was doing

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
and try to remain mindful

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
that one percent of the background,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
as I spoke before,

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
for as long as I can.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
The person is completely opposite.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Stop being mindful of that background

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
and just focus as hard as you can

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
to whatever it's right in front of you.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Not seeing the background.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It's basically like, imagine,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I don't know, what would be the similar?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Okay, fishing rod.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
You throw the fishing rod

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
into the water and then you have to wait for the fish

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
to grab the bait.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
You throw the rod, you take it out,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
you throw it, you throw it, you throw it, you throw it, you take it out.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
And then it becomes a goal in itself.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
And that's what you don't want to do.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
So, yeah, sometimes you have to attend back

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
to the things, to the reasoning, to the thoughts,

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
to what you've read, based on mindfulness.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Only so to relieve it.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
And see if it's going to settle the proper way.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
When you forget about it, then okay.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Remind yourself again.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
But that's the thing.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
I have to keep it right in front of your mind all the time,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
because that's impossible.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
You want to be able to let it go,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
like, seep into the background,

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
and still be aware of it.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
No matter how far it goes,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
you're aware to that extent.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
But you're still aware.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
That's why even 1% of such mindfulness

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
is actually more than enough

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
to be fully established

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
in the attitude of mindfulness.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
It's actually that for me,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
it would be to be fully established,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
to have 99% of your attention

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
needing to be mindful, no.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Because mindfulness is a structural thing.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
It's not something you do.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
What have to do in the beginning, yes,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
because you don't know what it is.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Once you discern it, knowing what mindfulness is,

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
is what makes you mindful.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Suppose if I'm mindful of the body posture,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
it's in my background.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Is it the same?

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
The thing is, you can be mindful of it actually.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
If you're thinking about your body posture,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
then your body is always the background,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
but now you're also thinking about it.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
So it's present in both ways.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
But sooner or later you have to stop thinking about it,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
and when you do,

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
you still want to be able to remain aware of it as a background.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Be aware.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Yeah, because it is there.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
That's the thing.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Your body is there.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Even if you forget about it,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
it is there in a certain position,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
in a certain posture, doing something.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
And if somebody was to ask you,

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
how is your body now,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
you would be able to give the answer right away.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Which means the knowledge of that is there.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
It's just not being recognized.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
If I'm aware of that,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
it means that already it's in front of you.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Now, if you're aware,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
if you can be aware of where it is,

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
if you append it,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
then you make it in front.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Because whether you append something or not,

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
you're aware of it.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
So awareness is more fundamental than the attention.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Structurally.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
It means that our awareness is not noticed.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah, I don't know this.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
If you're not noticing awareness,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
then you're unaware.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I know where.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
But awareness as a potential is there.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Because if you weren't cleaned,

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
you wouldn't wake up,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
you wouldn't be able to become aware.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
What's the difference between awareness and consciousness?

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Well, let's say the consciousness

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
is that direction given to you.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Direction that comes from that random body.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
No, both of the water is present all the time.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Yeah.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Awareness is present all the time.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
Well, awareness is probably all the time.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
It is potential all the time.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
But if you don't know it,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
then you're unaware.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
I don't know where.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
But you see time always over the back time.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
No, you're always in the direction.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
There is always a background.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
If there is a direction or something,

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
it means it has been directed from some point.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
And that's the background to where it is.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
So there is always that direction, that background.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
So it's always possible for you to recognize it,

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
to know it, to be mindful of it.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
But it doesn't mean that you always are mindful of it.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
Hence the point of the practice of dharma.

38:22.000 --> 38:29.000
Background, to see the background is important,

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
because I have to see the self,

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
from fear, from fear I'm attending.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
But you can't see yourself directly.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Yeah.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
And then say this is not myself.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
You just want to start including everything,

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
actual and peripheral, foreground and background.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And if you do that long enough,

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
you will start to discern that your sense of self

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
can't be in between the two.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
It's either the foreground or background.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
And as such, it can't be permanent.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
It's by not knowing that,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
you assume yourself to be in limbo.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
So neither foreground or background,

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
it's everywhere and nowhere.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
That's only because you don't really know

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
either foreground or the background.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
And that's that's your experience.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
Usually, the view is usually standing background.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
But it's not seen.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
But before I remember,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I spoke to you a lot,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
something about meditation.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
In meditation, usually, I see that

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
the whole picture of the mind,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
of course, being mindful of the body.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
But at the same time, in the mind,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
what kind of thought arising?

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
I see that.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
And then you, I remember,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I have to see the whole picture,

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
the whole picture that I'm taking in this mind.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
It means me or myself.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
So I have to see the whole picture,

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
no need to focus on the one thought.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
It's the same.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Yeah, we'll see it.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Like again,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
you're sort of repeating what I said,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
but you're not saying it in the same way.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
And the difference is, again,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
that being mindful of the background

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
means being mindful of your experience as a whole.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
But when you say,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I have to see the whole picture,

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
that means I have to attend the whole picture.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
So you're trying to put it all in front of you.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
And that's not what I'm saying.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Because no matter how much you manage

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
to put it in front of you,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
there's always going to be background to it.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And if you don't recognize it,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
it means you have left quite a good bit out.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
And that's where yourself is going to be then.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
But if you start seeing,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
okay, this is actually what I'm doing,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
while with the back of my mind,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
I'm mindful of myself doing that,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
which is already a formal background

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
for what you're doing.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Eventually, you recognize that there is no room

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
for yourself to be anywhere in between,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
or left, or it will be either here or there,

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
as such, it will pertain to either here or there,

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
and it won't be that sense of independent self.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
It means that,

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
it means the purpose of the practice

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
is that to find out that there is nothing

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
actually can find that as a self,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
that's suppose that if I'm mindful of the body,

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
I have to...

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
To find out that your sense of self,

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
basically, is not independent.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Because at the moment, for a particular sense of self,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
feels independent of anything,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
and everything.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
So by always practicing mindfulness,

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
well, by developing the extent of mindfulness,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
for as long as it's necessary,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
then it can become apparent that,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
even that sense of self,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
that appears that can be talked about,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
can be designated,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
it's not independent.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
It's depending upon this reason background,

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
and these things that I'm directly attending,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
whatever they may be,

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
sweepingly,

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
washing dishes,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
rigging books, whatever,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
while your body randomly living,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
is present there, your sense is working and so on.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
So you realize the sense of self,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
it's usually was hiding kind of in between,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
by not knowing either of those things.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
But now that you've practicing mindfulness correctly,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
in regards to the experience as a whole,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
means sooner or later,

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
that sense of self will lose that

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
independence,

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
and you just, well,

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
even if there is sense of self,

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
it's not mine.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
It cannot be mine.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
And that's what not self means.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
I said it before,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
it doesn't mean there is no self,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
means that that which is taken as self,

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
is not yours.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Cannot be yours.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
And that's the thing,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
it concerns you,

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
ah, this is not myself,

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
that's not how you overcome the sense of self.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
You overcome that by knowing that,

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
that cannot even be your sense of self

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
and could not have been your sense of self.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
And then it won't be your sense of self.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
So why are you moving?

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
You are using the main thing in mindfulness

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
that I am doing this,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that I'm washing the carpal.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
You're thinking about that.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
So you can be washing the carpal over there,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
but you don't want to have to be telling yourself,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I am washing the carp,

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I am washing the carp.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
You want to know,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
you want to be seeing yourself

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
with the back of your mind,

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
seeing yourself washing the carp.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
So it's, let's say,

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
let's put it like this,

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
it's a bit more relaxed

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
than needing to constantly attend it.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
I am washing the carp,

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
I am washing the carp,

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
I am holding the carp.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
No, you already picked up the carp,

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
you don't have to keep telling yourself,

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
what you're doing,

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
you know what you're doing.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
So you just want to,

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
almost like,

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
almost imagine,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
another view,

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
looking at you,

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
doing this,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
but not interfering,

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
not telling you anything,

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
just keeping an eye

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
on what you're doing.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
And that's the practice of reflection.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
You just reflect upon yourself,

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
doing whatever you happen to be doing.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
It means not keeping someone

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
like outside,

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
you know,

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
some people,

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
they advise you

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
to really keep someone,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
like the observer.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Yeah, but there's a thing,

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
if you start keeping the observer,

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
you start assuming

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
that observer to be your

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
more real self.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
But no,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
the only reason you can reflect

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
upon yourself doing something

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
is because you're doing something,

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
you're able to do something.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
So that particular thing you're doing

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
is the reason,

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
or rather,

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
that particular body

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
that you're using

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
in doing these things,

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
is the reason

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
that you're alive,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
that you're able to think,

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
and do these things,

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
and discern them

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
as something to be done.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
So no matter how far you go

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
in your reflection,

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
and your observer,

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
or whatever else,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
that will never be independent

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
of this living body

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
right here,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
that it's washing the dishes.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
And vice versa,

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
washing the dishes

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
will never be intelligible or known

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
if there is no reflection

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
in regard to it.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Hence, now,

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
you should determine

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
each other like the two sticks,

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
you move on,

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
the other one falls,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
instantly.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
So that anchor is anything

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
working,

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
like a background,

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
it depends on the person

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
that some people

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
they like to keep,

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
anchoring in some

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
regular breath,

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
or something.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Anything working well.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Well,

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
everything can be an anchor,

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
but not,

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
there doesn't

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
say we mean that people can actually

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
establish an anchor

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
of mindfulness in everything.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
What's the purpose of anchor?

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
I mean,

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
it's a disability.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Well, anchor means mindfulness.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Anchor in that means

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
you're mindful of that.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
You are reflecting upon yourself

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
while you're washing the dishes.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
You're mindful of the background

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
while you're washing the dishes.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
And when I say mindful of the background,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I don't mean mindful of different things.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
I mean,

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
I wash the dishes,

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
but I'm listening to this sound,

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
which,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
because of that, I mindful no.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Wash the dishes means

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
you're mindful of your body washing the dishes.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
So you're mindful of standing.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
You're mindful of the given body,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
while you're doing particular dishes

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
with your hands and so on.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Well, you can even be mindful of the intention.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
To wash the dishes.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Because for as long as you're

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
intention to have the dishes washed,

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
is present,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
you'll be washing the dishes.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
When that intention changes,

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
you stop doing it.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Either because you finished

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
or because something more important came up.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
But that's the thing.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
What people do,

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
they don't see them.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
So you have the intention to wash the dishes,

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
and you start washing the dishes

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
and you forgot about the intention to wash the dishes.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
But it's actually still present there,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
just now in that background,

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
on a more general level.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Why? Because if it were not present there,

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
you wouldn't be picking up the sponge,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
taking more washing up liquid,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
getting another cup.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
But all of that is bombed

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
by a more general intention of having these dishes washed,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
having the sink clean.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
And if you're mindful of that more general intention,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
they're still there.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
So you don't have to create it,

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
fabricate it,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
you just have to disown it because it's there.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
Then you'll be mindful of whatever particular things you do

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
on account of that intention.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
And that's just,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
and that intention and so on,

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
it's another thought.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
But it's a more subtle thought.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Then the actual thoughts you're having

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
while you're washing the dishes.

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
It means if my mindfulness is on the body posture,

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
then being aware of the intention.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
You can be mindful of your body posture

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
and then don't interfere with your thoughts

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
and what you're doing,

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
why are you mindful of your body posture?

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
That may be simple.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
I didn't know what I'm doing with that scene.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Whatever you're doing,

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
you can do only because your body is still there alive.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
Senses are working and functioning.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
So if you're mindful of that body,

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
body posture more specifically,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
and then allow yourself,

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
allow your mind to go and do things.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
While peripherally,

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
you do, like,

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
keep the corner of your eyes,

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
so to speak,

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
on that body posture,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
while you're doing this stuff.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
And that will always already be a more accurate practice

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
of mindfulness.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
So you don't want to be overly intending,

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
overly intending things.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
You don't want to be,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
I'm washing the dishes,

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
I'm washing the dishes,

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
I'm standing, I'm standing, I'm standing,

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
because they're just bringing things forward,

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
forcefully,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
which means you'll never ever see that background

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
and there won't be any anchor established in it.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
But if you recognize that this standing body,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
or sitting body,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
this body in itself,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
for as long as it's alive,

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
will be the direct reason for this whole world,

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
existing and standing,

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
and these feelings,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
experience and so on.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
If those elements break apart,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
if they're taken away,

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
and they will be,

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
because I have no idea

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
where they came from,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
how they're given,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
or how can they even be,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
what they can't even be accessed in any way,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
but they are the reason

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
for your whole experience as a whole.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
So when those four great elements go,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
you can't even conceive the experience

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
to remain standing.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
So how about you just simply

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
do body contemplation?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
This is body contemplation.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Well again,

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
if you do it correctly,

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
it's fine.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
But if you're doing body contemplation,

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
in terms of just bringing things forward into your mind,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
while not seeing the background,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
you won't be mindful of it.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Body contemplation over to see the body contemplation.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Well, body contemplation,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
the correct one in the sutras,

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
it's just recognizing the random parts of the body,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
as that, because of which,

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
you're able to even think about the random parts of your body.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Taking the body as mine.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Yeah, that's the result of it.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
How is it,

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
isn't going to be,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
is it teased at the right of the body

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
feeling in common,

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
the changing?

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
It's not feeling.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
The sensation they talk about,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
is just the bodily perceptions.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
But obviously,

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
by calling them feelings,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
they kind of give them a more prominent position,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
which results if you can observe that

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
long enough, you'll be purified.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
But that's already the contradiction in terms.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
There is no moving feeling through your hand or through your arm.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
That's a sensation.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
You can call it that's a perception,

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
which means you think your perception is what you feel.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
So you're more confused than you were before you started doing that method.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Contemporary on the perception

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
that the changing in common is positive.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Nothing.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Why is that relevant?

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
Yeah.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Why is it relevant how my elbow feels?

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
It doesn't matter.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Mine is hurt.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
So what?

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
The main problem is

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
you're taking the body as mine.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
No.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
The main problem is not,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
he doesn't know the way out of unpleasant feeling.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
That's the main problem.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
That's why protrusion is protrusion.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
He doesn't know for no truth.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
But it's the truth.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
So you can say that his body

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
for the eternity,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
he's looking in the wrong place.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
It's not why and how I feel this body

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
and how it changes and how it moves.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
It's why do I not know escape

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
from the feelings that arise

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
dependent on this body?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Any feelings?

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
Can't escape because

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
taking the body as mine.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Well, they can escape

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
because they don't know what escape is.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
But if someone here

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
like contemplated this body

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
with airmen, firemen,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
some of these are the changing...

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Again, is there doing it

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
running from to them

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
overattending it?

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
It will not stand for that

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
which elements are.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Because elements are always

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
the background.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
The four grey elements

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
can be discerned

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
and recognized

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
in that very distant background.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
That is present.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
It's right there and now,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
but it's much, much, much subtler.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
And unless your attention

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
has been trained

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
to the subtler levels,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
you just won't be able to see it.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
You look like,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
well, imagine you have a lens.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Camera lens or a pair of glasses, whatever.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
That it's only for a certain distance.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
Like 50 millimeters to 80 millimeters distance,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
which means anything before that you won't see.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
No matter how close you look,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
you're just overseeing it.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
And then that's basically

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
untrained attention.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
You're just used to overattending things.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
That's what you used to regard.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
That's what you're able to recognize.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Anything less than that you won't see.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
So with person with such attention,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
even if they think about elements,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
or whatever they want to be thinking about elements,

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
they think what they are.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
But they'll think about that,

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
which they think elements are,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
based on that scope of attention that they have.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But if you start training your attention

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
in regard to the background,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
you start seeing more of that direction

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
without actually having to change it.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Why?

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Is it how to contemplate

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
all the implements of the body?

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Well, again, if you,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
your body right there right now,

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
whatever, you have saved

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
position and you have saved more particular things.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
But overall, that body aging,

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
that body growing, that body getting sick,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
that body being subject and permanent,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
you can't stop that.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
You can't even conceive

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
how it would be if you could control it.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
It's just inaccessible to you.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
And if you clarify that,

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
you can start seeing that body

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
as actually a reason for your whole life,

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
for your whole experience,

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
for everything.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Everything you ever experienced,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
everything you ever experienced,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
is because your body was there living

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
with senses functioning.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
So your experience can't remain standing

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
without that body.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
So the implements is not looking at the change,

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
because change is just another experience.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
The implements is recognizing that

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
it's inaccessible.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
The thing has a reason on its own,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
that body is there on its own, really.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
You didn't have say,

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
it's creation, it's manifestation,

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
it's a sense, it's not anything.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
You're just using it.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
But you can only use it because

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
it was already given beforehand,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
and that's what impermanence means.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Ah, this using won't last forever.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Why? Because where these things came from

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
is inconceivable to me.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I can't even imagine

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
where and how the elements, whatever.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
But you can't even access it.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Because of that, it's impermanent.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
Not because, not because you can see it being destroyed.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
There is nothing to do with your body.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
We don't have to see that it is there,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
where the body or thought or whatever.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
Only has to see, no need to see any change.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Only has to see that it is there.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Actually, you want to not see the change.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
Because change is always on a more particular level,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
while thing remains the same on a more general level.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
And that's what you want to start distinguishing.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Because for as long as you're going after change,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
your mind is going with it.

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
So you're not seeing the nature of that.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Because when the thing is changing,

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
there has to be a degree of that thing standing the same.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
And that's always on a more general level.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
That's why.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Well, it's always it ends like that.

54:48.000 --> 54:54.000
Some, I think some, some, some, they don't have identification with the body.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
But some would, just identify with the mental aggregates on it.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Well, I mean, theoretically, that's possible,

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
but I said that.

55:01.000 --> 55:08.000
But I think now there is, it's more than a potential identity identified with the body and everything.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
If, if the potential was to have that much wisdom,

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
to truly, truly abandon his body for what it is,

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
with all of the instruction today and all the suitors

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
and coming across the dominant Buddhist teaching,

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
he won't need much more to then discern the general nature of the mind

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
and any other phenomena as impermanent

55:29.000 --> 55:35.000
and not being able to hold his own self.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
So most likely, the potential...

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
It's possible that 100% of the,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
never identify with the body for what it is.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Is it possible to do that?

55:44.000 --> 55:50.000
Well, theoretically, it's possible, but it would still mean a lot of wisdom.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
But it's quite unlikely that the person today will develop so much wisdom

55:53.000 --> 56:00.000
and not come across the Buddhist teaching to kind of get the final right tune of the right view.

56:00.000 --> 56:09.000
There is no different mental and bodily aggregates.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
The experiences are always experienced as well.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Your body wouldn't be known as your body,

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
if it's not already appearing on a mental level.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Your thoughts wouldn't be known as your thoughts

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
if your living body is not already there.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
So that distinction between body and mind,

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
it's kind of unnecessary.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
What do you mean by resistance,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
the designation of something,

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
you wrote in your book,

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
what do you mean by resistance?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Well, it's what I was talking about,

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
the four great elements, for example.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
They are what your body made of.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
I just had a question.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Why is it used in sutra instead of for greater?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Why is this great?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Because they're so general.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
So much in the background.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
It's the great.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Great.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
The great elements, yeah.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Mahabuddha.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Mahabuddha is the power.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
And...

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
Your body being made out of those elements.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
Again, as I said,

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
your body is known as your body

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
because it's still living there.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
You can download it.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Your body is known as such

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
because the body is there as that

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
because of which you can know that body.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
Well, there is that

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
a resisting aspect to that body,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
the aspect that you can't even access,

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
you can't even comprehend.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
Because of which your body is aging,

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
subject to elements change,

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
disappearance, destruction, and so on.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
So it's that extent

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
of that resistance that comes from these elements.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
But that is upon which your whole experience is actually founded.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
So you start to discern,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
you start to know

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
that you are fully depending upon something

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
you can't even think of

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
and you can't even comprehend.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
You just get the sense of it resisting you.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Hence resistance.

58:09.000 --> 58:16.000
Resistance.

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
Means the resistance.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
Means not being in your control.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Means you can't even conceive it to be in your control.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
It's offering...

58:29.000 --> 58:33.000
That means your volition, your will, has its limits.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
It can't reach its own foundations.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
They are resisting it.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
They are showing their own independence.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
You can't even change.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
You can't even think of it.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
It is only for those who have served you.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
In a distance of 30 years.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Well, no.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
That's basically the four elements.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
They find the footing in the experience

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
for as long as it is in or of the present.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
So they are and can talk about resistance

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
but there is nothing resisting it or resisting him

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
or resisting in it or out of it.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
It's just the four elements

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
will remain sort of floating about

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
for as long as the followers are there

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and when he dies they are ticked.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
No more even because it's all talking about.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
For Arya again there is sort of a bit of both

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
until all of the poison and toxins are cleared out.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
But a putogenite would be me and then whenever he needs the resistance

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
he would be resisting me, resisting in regard to me.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
I am resisting it.

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
I am resisting in it or out of it or whatever.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
It means trying to control it.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
Trying to control it.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
I was suffering.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Yes.

59:40.000 --> 59:45.000
But you want to recognize just that the foundations of your experience

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
are there which resist you

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
because it can never even be taken up.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
You can't see directly the four great elements.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
They are always in the background.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
The four great elements as the foundation of this random body

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
is just because what you see will be your perception

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
and four great elements are determining your perception

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
which means you can't ever access them with that perception.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You can only know that your perception is there because of

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
that which resist out there that you can't even see.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Resistance and designation?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Well that's the designation.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Perception would be the designation.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
What you can perceive, you can talk about,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
you can designate, you can think it.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
But not that because of which that perception is there

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000
in the first place.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So that which resist is what's being designated.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000
As that because of which designation is possible in the first place.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So this is all kind of a slightly more advanced way of saying

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
that fundamentally things are completely out of your control,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
including your own sense of control.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Nobody is denying your sense of control.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Nobody is denying your sense of control.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
What you want to realize is that you can't own even that.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Why? Because it's fully found that which is completely out of your hands.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Self is always in regard to that sense of control.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So once you start recognizing that your own sense of control is enclosed

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
with this whole thing that it's limiting you.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Then that you realize that well even this control that I can't access

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
as modified things to an extent I can't know about.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It's not permanent because when its foundations go, it will all go.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But what's the raw concentration?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Because it's part of the eightfold path.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Concentration is the key more things together.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Like usually people think concentration is focusing hard on one point.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
No, it's finding the one point that includes everything else.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Not finding the one that excludes everything else.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Concentration means being fully established and steady in that background

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
that I'm talking about.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
When you concentrate it is when your mind is settled in that background.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And no matter what actually you're doing,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
what things are attacking you, harassing you, coming your way,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
pleasing you, displeasing you.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
That concentration remains steady and I'm all alone.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And so the will always use those descriptions of unshakeable

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
and so on and so forth.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
So because it's fully established in this,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
so whatever it's coming, it still stays to your constant mind.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It's concentrated.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So it's about taking everything like that.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
It's about becoming so established.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
It's about, well again, becoming so stepping back so much

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
that you get really, really settled in that background.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
So there is no concentration without mindfulness.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
If the concentration is about focusing and not seeing anything else,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
that's not concentration.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
The concentration of the sutras is the concentration where you're so mindful

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
that even when you're not making effort to be mindful,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
you're still mindful of that.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
But none of us said that no matter how far the puturjuna reflects

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
that there's still an aspect of ignorance and that reflection.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Yeah, which is why he has to take it on artificially

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
and start looking for what he reflects upon

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
as in permanent, as suffering,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
and then as his experience is not.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
He doesn't see any of that.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Oh, so he starts emulating it from inside

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and if he does it correctly and if it corresponds

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
to the things the way they are,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
it will take the...

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So if you refer to it as a graph,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
if they are on an alien graph,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and then it takes over eventually.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So then formal meditation,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I've done that so often like clamping up and trying to focus

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
really hard on the body or the breath, but instead...

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
No, just find your body as already there breathing.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And that's a very clear...

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Yeah, yeah, it's just there.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
You have to go grasp it or reach out for it.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And the mind will always inevitably be attending to something.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Yeah, essentially it doesn't matter what it is.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Yeah, in that sense.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Like if you're mindful of your body,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
you don't have to worry about...

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
In that correct sense,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
if you find your body present there,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
you don't have to worry about what exactly you are thinking

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
that second on a particular level,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
because you have to be thinking something.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And then being aware of thoughts,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
like when you're thinking,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
it takes a lot of your mental focus and energy,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
but you still have to add some reflection...

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Well, again, like thinking.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You know, if mostly attention is gone,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
dedicated to whatever you're thinking about,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
still, you know you're there alive,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
this random body is still living and functioning.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And that's the reason for you being able to think in the first place.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So having that little knowledge is enough,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
because no matter how much you're caught up in your thoughts,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
if this body is not there present,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
alive on its own completely indifferent to your thoughts,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
those thoughts are going to be there.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
They couldn't.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Inconservable.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Okay.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Sometimes I feel like,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I'm a monster,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
but sometimes, some of the automatic things are created

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
and the interest of what you think,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
thoughts are very automatic reviews.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And sometimes it's just the only different.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Well, look, particular thoughts are reduced.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Thoughts are not reduced.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
They can just be in slower or whatever else,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
but it's not reduced because your particular thoughts

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
about this might disappear,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
but the fact that you're aware of your experiences

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
or your breathing means.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
But you're thinking of that,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
That's being thought.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So that's not in progress.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Suppose it's more time thinking about this bread.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Automatically it's become related.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
If it's just thinking about the bread only,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
it's not thinking much.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Well, you can think about the bread.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
For as long as you're still established mindfully

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
upon the experiences, upon that background,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
upon your body breathing,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
and you're intending then bread.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
But if you're just thinking what's right in front of you,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
you're trying to turn yourself into a robot,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
and it will not work.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Because you're not mindful.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
You're mindful only in reference to the background.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
That's what mindfulness is.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
If you're just bringing things forward,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
that's not mindfulness.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Some people, when they just want to practice jhana, jhana.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
That's not jhana either, yeah.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Jhana is being fully established in that background.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
To the extent where the domain is,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
you step outside of the domain of centrality,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
the first jhana.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Then the domain of thought in the second jhana.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
So you're not any more thinking about this thought,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
or that thought, means...

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Yeah.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Means...

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Yeah.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You're not thinking about this thought,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
the nature of thinking is there.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Nature of a thought.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And that's very, very general, as you can see,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
that it's just completely not specific,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
yet it's really such.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And that's what I mean when I say a background.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And that's the first jhana.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The second jhana goes beyond that.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Goes beyond the domain of the nature of thought.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
In the civil war, doing the daily, daily activity,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
sometimes when I feel a little...

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
like some day feel like there's so many,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
like too much thinking sometimes,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
so much of thought.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And if I just want to reduce that thought,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
then just...

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Don't reduce the thought.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Reduce your emotional involvement with that thought.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
If you try interfering with your thoughts,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
you just try and you end up thinking more.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
That's not what.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
So you'll be worse than before.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But if you're mindful of your body

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
being present there while you're thinking,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
it can give you enough space

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
to know to be fully,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
completely immersed in whatever your mind is thinking.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And that's all, that's enough.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
You just have to be patient with that,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
and it will be recognized as enough.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Why? Because no matter how hard your mind is working,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
for as long as you're not emotional disturbed,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
it's absolutely fine.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Even if it's horrible thoughts,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
even if it's thoughts that you don't want to have,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
emotionally you're not involved,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
that's your concern.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Because whatever thoughts ever is,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
and they will have to cease.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But if you try to interfere with them before,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
means, oh, well, you've taken

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
then the main thought is yours.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You think you have said

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
in what you should be thinking, and so on.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
So you start interfering with it.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Sometimes I write a little contemplative.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Very well, it's like suffering arises.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
A lot of times I'm actually more like identification to you.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So then I hear any kind of suffering.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
No, the suffering, the suffering has a reason.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It means identification was there beforehand.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
That's already like a symptom of the underlying problem.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Are you bored?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
That's the symptom of the underlying problem.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
It's not that that's when you're in the identification happens.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And you have to catch it or something like that.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
So for you, in your mind,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
a lot of thoughts appear.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
No problem at all, right?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yes, your mind...

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
They were never a problem, yeah?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
How do you...

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
How do you still...

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
What is a reason to cease?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
You contemplate on the individual.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Well, you just...

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Again, you stop concerning yourself with a particular thought,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
unless there is a reason for it.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
You just recognize there is a nature of thinking.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000
You can go out if you want.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So there is a nature of thinking.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Thoughts are there.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
It doesn't matter what thoughts.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Thoughts are there.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
It means you're already mindful in regard to whatever you're thinking.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
You finish something stronger than fear.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Well, that's the thing.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So then you just endure it.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And then when the fear is gone,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
practice even harder in regard to things

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
that are not too powerful and too overwhelming.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
That's how you develop strength.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
So then when the next time fear comes,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
well, it will be stronger.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
So you'll be less affected by it.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
But at the time, you can't feel it.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Now the problem has to fix it.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Right now, right now, right now, you won't work.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Fixing it right here, right now,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
will be not interfering with it.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
That's the closest to fixing that you can get.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
This need to endure.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
For what is there?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Because you won't be there all the time.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And then next time,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
if you're not practicing hard enough,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
then you'll remember, well,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
there was that time when fear arose

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and I didn't know how to escape that fear.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And it was very frightening and painful.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So I better practice now when there is no fear.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So when the fear comes,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I'll be able to handle it and hold it

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
without being moved by it.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So you use that as an incentive

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
to make more effort.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
What the moment only has to endure.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
When the fear is there,

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
you can sometimes, you know, the fear might be there.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And you still might be able to be mindful,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
but if it gets too much, then again,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
you can keep trying to be mindful,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
but bottom line is don't forget

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
to endure and be patient.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
That's always the end basis.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
If everything else fails,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
well, at least I'll be able to endure it.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Why not?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Well, for 100, there's no contact with it.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Well, for 100, there is no endurance.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Yeah, there's no more fear.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Yeah, depending on how much toxins are left.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
More toxins, more endurance.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
More fear.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
More liability to fear,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
even if he doesn't necessarily experience it.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
But I don't think

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
even the possibility of fear is gone.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Not just that he doesn't experience any fear actually,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
but even the possibility of it cannot be...

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
How do you still think you are very sick

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
and you're also pain?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
How do you...

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
It's a discomfort,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
but it doesn't bring the fear

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
and it doesn't bring the mental suffering.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
How do you make the mindful decisions?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Well, you maintain it by developing it beforehand.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Before you can take it.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
That's why the Buddha urged monks and people.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Like, don't wait until it's too late.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Because there is a point when it's too late to practice.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
You haven't done enough.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Now it's just too late.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
If you spend your whole life not keeping the precepts,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
not really making the effort

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
at the moment of it's too late,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
you can't expect nothing.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I've been all fixed in the last year of your life

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
or something like that.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
And every year might be your last year.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And if any time you might be too late already,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
or last year or not,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
that's why you kept bringing the sense of urgency

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
in monks and people.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Well, practicing the egon during sickness

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
will give you a peace for a year later.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Yeah, you can't suffer now.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Like, suffering is when this comfort

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
or this pleasure affects you mentally,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
causing you pain.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
No suffering means you can have

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
even this comfort and this pleasure

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
and not suffer on that account.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It doesn't affect you.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
It's present, it's discomfortable,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
but it's not a reason for the pain.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Why? Because it never was.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
It was always craving in regard to an experience

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
that was the reason for your pain.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Now that craving is gone, there's no pain.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Even in the midst of this comfort,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
you can't possibly suffer.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
That doesn't mean you don't perceive the discomfort.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
But you certainly don't feel the pain on the canvas.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Pupiner, when you had a fever,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
how would you feel?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Even so, but there was some sort of suffering.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Because you still had lots of toxins left.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
So he was a sort of a doctor,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
but you still had a long way to go,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
but he couldn't go because he was so sick

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
with medicines and everything else.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
He couldn't be making the effort,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
he couldn't be doing nothing, feeling sick,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
in pain and not being able to practice.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
So he thought, well, I might as well speed it up.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
But, you know, sort of on a nose,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
he's a sort of on that.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
So he had knocked out about that.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Well, a genuine sort of on a nose,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
he's a sort of on that.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Sometimes you have people who think they're on that.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That's what it would be.
