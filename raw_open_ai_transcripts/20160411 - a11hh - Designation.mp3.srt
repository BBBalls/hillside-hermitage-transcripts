1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
These questions seem to revolve around a suitor that maybe I should read out and it's the

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:33,560
a big pecuni, some uter from the name of Padira and talk about the chariot. So go for it, I don't know where he is now.

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Mara, the evil one, says, by whom is this creature formed? Who is the creature's maker? Who is the risen creature?

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Who is the creature that ceases? And Padira the nun says, why do you refer to the creature? Mara, are you involved in wrong view?

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:09,560
This is a pile of pure determinations. There is here no creature to be found, just as for an assemblage of parts there is the term chariot.

6
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:19,560
So when there are the aggregates, convention says the creature. It is merely suffering that comes into being, suffering that stands and disappears.

7
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Nothing apart from suffering comes into being, nothing other than suffering ceases.

8
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,560
That's it? Yeah, that's quite good. See, there's the whole point there, the designation of a chariot.

9
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:51,560
As she says, can I have that please? She never, she does not deny the name, the term, given to the assemblage of parts.

10
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,560
There is a assemblage of parts, there is a name chariot. It's a functional assemblage of parts, it's called chariot.

11
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:12,560
All of it is real. The assemblage of parts, yeah, you can break the chariot into parts, or rather you can descend the parts within the chariot, in the same sense you can descend more particular things within the general things.

12
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Ultimately the most general being the five aggregates, the nature of form, feeling, deception, determinations, consciousness. Within that general phenomenon of those aggregates, you can have more particular manifestations of it.

13
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,560
And the experience as a whole evolve, you can call a person, you can call whatever.

14
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:48,560
But there's a difference between if you're just designating it, or if that designation stands for your self view, for your wrong view of really assuming the priority of that designation over those parts.

15
00:02:48,560 --> 00:03:00,560
So the problem is that the questions of the king, King Melinda, I think it evolved around similar, but it's somewhat subtle, but not that subtle.

16
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:12,560
But again, if people don't really carefully, they won't see it. Well, by, he dismisses, he says that by destroying parts, you destroy the name that you've given to the parts.

17
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Not even that, not even you destroy, but more like you deny the reality of it. Because he said, well, see there is a chariot.

18
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:29,560
But if you take a chariot and break it up, break these parts up, then there is no chariot anymore.

19
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,560
No, there is. There's still parts of chariot. It's just, it's not functional anymore, so you can call it somewhere else, something else.

20
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:48,560
So you don't, like, he might have replaced the particular designation of a chariot, but he doesn't see that he did not undo the nature of designation standing for your wrong view.

21
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,560
In other words, he might have fixed, not even fixed, he might have replaced or affected a particular designation, but not affected the nature of designation.

22
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Why? Because you can destroy the chariot into parts, or even destroy the parts, into completely non-functional parts.

23
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Still, there is a designation in regard to that, you would call it the pile of rubbish.

24
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,560
And it's equally real, as the chariot was a designation for functional assemblage of those parts, not just when they were thrown around on a pile.

25
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:25,560
So you can't, like, even conceive not having a designation, like name and matter, number, or just, oh, that's your experience.

26
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Not just, oh, undo Nama, and have the pure full group of whatever else. They don't even think in those terms, but they do imply that affecting designation, destroying it, denying its reality, or whatever else, somehow frees you from the view attached to it.

27
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,560
But it doesn't, because you can't actually even conceive the absence of designation, because an absence of designation is another designation.

28
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Oh, there is no designation here. You just designated it with that.

29
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:06,560
So, sister Vajira here, she does not, be cognizant yet. Yeah.

30
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,560
She does not, yeah, Vajira, the nun. She does not deny. She doesn't say this chariot is not real.

31
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:21,560
She says, this chariot, this designation exists on account of the five aggregates existing.

32
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,560
But she has fully understood that the five aggregates have a reason on their own.

33
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,560
You cannot even conceive being a master of them, or owning them, they manifest for that reason, they will cease.

34
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Thus, any designation that arises in regard to that shares the same nature, cannot even be owned, appropriated access, nothing.

35
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,560
It just designates this while this is. But this is not anymore, that designation is it.

36
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,560
But there is no question of whether it's real or not, and what's behind it, and what comes first, not anything like that.

37
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:02,560
So, she has no need to destroy the five aggregates to prove to herself that designation is mere hollow, designation of whatever else.

38
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,560
No, she knows that the five aggregates have a, you can't even destroy the five aggregates. That's incomprehensible.

39
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:17,560
You can't change the order of the parts, as in a bit of points out in his critique of the questions of King Melinda.

40
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Because you can undo chariot, but you can't do your own experience and like throw it on a pile and prove yourself that your designation because of that are not real.

41
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:37,560
It's a bit like a fantasy that doesn't even stand like it remotely for the way things actually are, because you can't even conceive the step outside of your experience and change it

42
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:47,560
to see that it can be changed. But that happens when people want to observe, they want to perceive the change as a proof of impermanence or whatever else.

43
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:58,560
But as I said before, that's not what impermanence is. Impermanence is in the fact that a thing, an aggregate, a phenomenon of any kind, has a reason on its own.

44
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:07,560
You have no say in its manifestation. For that very reason, it's impermanent, because it has a reason, that's why it has to cease.

45
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:16,560
No other reason. Just because you've manifested and you have no access to the point of origin of that benefit.

46
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:25,560
You can't even conceive how things are, they just manifest basically. All you can discern is arising. For that reason, that thing will have to cease.

47
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:37,560
But can't you discern arising, but you can also know that it is dependent, that it is a reason, because of some, well, dependent on something else.

48
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Such a?

49
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,560
It can't arise. You can't just have designation and a river.

50
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Oh yeah, no, no. I'm just talking about the experience as a whole. I'm not talking about designation itself here, when I was referring to anything that arises.

51
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Because anything that arises can be taken as a thing itself. Thus the sort of analysis that whatever has the nature of arising, has the nature of ceasing.

52
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Be it a designation, be it a perception, be it a days, be it that, shares the nature of arising.

53
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Because it partakes in that nature. For that reason, because it manifests, that's why it's impermanent.

54
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Not because you see it's ending, you see it's cessation. You see it's disappearance of destruction. No.

55
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:23,560
You know that it's there, because it has a reason. If it has a reason, it could have not ceased in the future. It could have not be liable to a possibility to cease in the future.

56
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Why? Because it's never manifested. Because it was manifested, that's why it's going to go.

57
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Even if you never see it go, you know, it's manifested, thus it's impermanent.

58
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Because when I say it's manifested, thus it's impermanent, because it is dependent on something.

59
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:51,560
What? Well, like the particles, I feel, feeling can't just be by itself.

60
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,560
No, they will come fine, but still what's the dependence? I don't see the connection there. Unless, go?

61
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Yes, I mean, that is dependent on the other four.

62
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Yeah, well, but the other fours are equally dependent on each other.

63
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:16,560
So, which means that you basically, from an arisen thing, as arisen, you went into comparison with other arisen things.

64
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,560
And I have treated them as a group, failing to see that that entire group is just one arisen thing.

65
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Also, on a more general level, and that is impermanent.

66
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,560
For no other reason, then the reason of, because it has arisen.

67
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Okay, you can get five aggregates, you can say they are well, they depend on each other well, and what, or five of them depend on them.

68
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Or nothing.

69
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Because any dependence you look of that kind is a linear dependence that you can perceive.

70
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,560
They don't need to depend on anything.

71
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Just the fact that they have manifested, and their sense of self comes secondary to that, and always will be.

72
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,560
You can't access. You can't be the reason for the manifestation.

73
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,560
You can't arm here, and then create them out there.

74
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Why? Because even the thought of arm here is already preceded by the appearance of the five aggregates.

75
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,560
So, they are always ahead of you, or below you, or around you, and closed within them.

76
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,560
They will be the most accurate to put it.

77
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,560
So, sure, yeah, there is no feeling without perception and intention. There is an intention without feeling and perception.

78
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:40,560
So, depending on what approach you take, the point is, well, all of them, as the experience is at all, as general as you can push it,

79
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,560
share the same nature of being manifested.

80
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,560
And that's the sole reason for their impermanence.

81
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:55,560
So, you can't explain that using linear explanation, because if you could, means that our view could be explained,

82
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,560
could be deduced by observing things, but you can't.

83
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,560
That's why it's so subtle to get it. It's still a view.

84
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:13,560
But it comes only personally as a direct insight, based on obvious external instructions, knowing what to look for.

85
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:26,560
And that's why it's always summed up in that general, very general description of whatever has a nature arising, has a nature of ceasing,

86
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,560
which is basically the other way, putting it in permanent.

87
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Whatever has a nature arising, it's in permanent.

88
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
And that's the whole point.

89
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Your five aggregates don't cease, but as long as you look. So, if you need them to actually observe their cessation in order to understand impermanence,

90
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
that's a constriction in terms, means, because you'll be dead when they cease.

91
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,560
So, how can you observe impermanence then? You can't.

92
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:01,560
So, impermanence is not in the scientific observation of things disintegrating in impermanence,

93
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:21,560
is in the fact that you have no control, no input, in that very subtle, very general notion of things arising, manifesting.

94
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:28,560
And the experience of destruction of things, it's another arising.

95
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,560
So, arising is manifesting, ceasing is manifesting, changing whilst checking, the sanding is also manifesting.

96
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:48,560
And because things are manifesting, they're impermanent, not because they have a duration or a shelf life.

97
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:59,560
There's always some, maybe I can't remember far back in I thought, it's things are always changing, it's always things.

98
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Just taking on different forms, never ending, just taking on another form, evolving, becoming.

99
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,560
It's an iron, I can't remember our previous life or previous forms.

100
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,560
But it's a duration or something. But then you fail to see, right there and then,

101
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,560
that you have a thought that connects all of those forms.

102
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,560
And you're not seeing that thought as impermanent, which is where your self is, which is why there are wrong views,

103
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,560
which is why people can't think that, and which is why people do think,

104
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:44,560
ah, like the matter, the four great elements of fire, depending on what division you take, and although I list those wrong views in the suitors,

105
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,560
there's nothing really destroying, nothing really changes, they're always there, they just change its shape or whatever else,

106
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,560
but it's always the same things always has been, always will be.

107
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,560
So whether you chop someone's head off or whatever, it's just elements going through elements, nothing exists,

108
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:07,560
not here, failing to see that that is a very gratuitous thought of you that you adopted,

109
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,560
and you have no proof for it, because if you can't remember what was in your previous life,

110
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,560
how can you remember that it was there if you can't remember that it wasn't?

111
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,560
You can't, which means you decide because it's more pleasing to you for whatever reason.

112
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,560
You decide that there was, you decide that there will be.

113
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:36,560
But if you were to remove all of the bad faith, which means it takes away all the wrong views,

114
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,560
the only thing that you can refer to as a fact, as a law, as something that is undeniable,

115
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,560
is something that you did not create, that you did not concoct in your thoughts or assumptions,

116
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,560
would be whatever has a reason, it's incriminate, that's it, only that.

117
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,560
So then the old Dhamma is built just on that, or within that.

118
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,560
And yeah, you can build a good thought.

119
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:21,560
When you look back to the memories of your past, you connect that.

120
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Exactly, you made that connection right here, right now, for which you have no proof,

121
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,560
any more than the fact that you don't have proof whether it was really always changing or not,

122
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
or impermanent or not.

123
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Which means you decide, you make an assumption that it was so.

124
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Because there are, I was like, you have a photo of yourself as a child and you, as a teenager,

125
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
and you make the connection.

126
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
You look at the photo and say, that's who I was.

127
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,560
But it's who I am more.

128
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Well, there is a connection in a sense that there is a connection between particular and general.

129
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,560
It is still the enduring body that is changing while remaining the same.

130
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:12,560
It's a one offshoot from your mother that is now growing old and aging and so on,

131
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,560
while overall remaining the same body, the same produce.

132
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,560
But that's just, that's just things existing on different levels of generality.

133
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,560
Other changes, they are allowed to because on a more general level, a finger remains the same.

134
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,560
So arising, ceasing, and changing while standing.

135
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,560
So it's not all in there in front of you, which means if you approach your designation in that sense,

136
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,560
you won't see it as a designation.

137
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
It will always be in regard to that.

138
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,560
But none of that is a problem.

139
00:16:47,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Yeah, none of that is a problem because things need to exist or other things existence is comprised on different levels of generality.

140
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,560
So a more particular change means on a more general level, it's not changing.

141
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Then if you look at general level, you can see it's changing there because on a more general level, it's not changing.

142
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:20,560
And what is the ultimately, not changing on the most general level, it's the nature of form, nature of feeling, nature of perception, nature of determination, nature of consciousness.

143
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:28,560
That's why the five aggregates always remain that which is in common to any life you have before or none of life you're going to have ahead.

144
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,560
So you can think, ah, so the five aggregates are myself then because that remains I'm changing.

145
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
No, that changes too.

146
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,560
But nature in regard to that remains the same because there is a change in a more particular level.

147
00:17:41,560 --> 00:18:08,560
So, Antonio or Craig when he was born and he's lay life, the whole time spent in aging and growing and changing on that particular level, yeah, that's all real.

148
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Equally, as it's real to refer to that whole person as Craig, Antonio, when he was young or whatever.

149
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,560
People say that's not a real thing.

150
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Well, exactly.

151
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,560
So that's why she says, why is that a problem?

152
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Vajira, the nuns, it's just the aggregates and the term, the designate in them.

153
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
That's not a problem.

154
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:39,560
The problem is, and always has been, suffering being arising, suffering ceasing, suffering arising in regard to this suffering in regard.

155
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,560
So the whole structure of general particular, it's completely relevant.

156
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:52,560
I mean, it's relevant in a sense that it's confused as a source of problem, but it's not actually the source of problem, which is what it says.

157
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:01,560
When dirty aggregates, you call it a creature. It's merely suffering that comes into being, suffering that stands and suffering that disappears.

158
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,560
That's the issue, there has always been the issue, and you fix that, you fix all of the issues, nothing else.

159
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,560
So, denying the reality of designation, saying, well, this is just an empty convention.

160
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,560
As such, it is real. What's the problem?

161
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,560
If it's empty of four, what's the problem?

162
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Saying that it's an empty convention means you just designated further the original convention, or designation.

163
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,560
You designate the creature, and it's an empty designation of a creature.

164
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:38,560
And you can go indefinitely like that, infinitely, it's just the same thing. It's still a designation.

165
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Because people can say, it was never an issue.

166
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:49,560
However, I was African, now I'm British, you see, the definitions aren't real.

167
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Which is basically all revolves around denying their suffering.

168
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Because if you deny the reality of things that are apparently causing you to suffer, you feel like you did dealt with your suffering.

169
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:10,560
But it's a wrong view, it's a big mistake from the start, because neither designations nor anything external was ever the reason for your suffering.

170
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Because if you were, freedom from it would not be possible, why?

171
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,560
Because those things arise at their own.

172
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Which means suffering would always be manifested on its own, which means you have no say in it.

173
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,560
But that's not the case.

174
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,560
So being a subtle designation, a coarse designation, an empty designation, a full designation, be it a real thing, or unreal thing.

175
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,560
All of those are manifested phenomena, and as such, they're external.

176
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Which means they're never the reason for suffering. It's craving in regard to them.

177
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:48,560
In regard to what you feel, in regard to how we perceive things and so on, that the suffering is there.

178
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Presence of craving means presence of suffering.

179
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Absence of craving is absence of suffering.

180
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Leaving the whole domain of designations far back gets intact in that sense.

181
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:09,560
But because you don't discern that, because a person's pathogen that does not see the origin of suffering as an awful truth,

182
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:17,560
he assumes automatically, and that's why every pathogen that has in common, you can't do this by accident.

183
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,560
You can't do it wrongly by accident.

184
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Every pathogen assumes that when he suffers in regard to something, it's that something that's the reason for his suffering.

185
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Then you can sort of, on the clueless level, you hate people.

186
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Or you said something, he's a bad person, because I'm suffering in that account.

187
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,560
It's actually 100% his fault that I suffer.

188
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,560
Then you might work through that attitude and realize, well, be that as you may,

189
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,560
I really don't have to say about other people, so you might start refining it.

190
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,560
But you won't be able to go further than blaming designations for suffering.

191
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Pain blaming the apparent reality of things for your suffering, which is the ultimate reaching point,

192
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,560
which is not really ultimate of any kind, of Machiallum Buddhism or any other.

193
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Well, even the contemporary terravada Buddhism would deny, which denies the reality of things through western science,

194
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,560
is proven, the things are constantly changing, thus nothing is real, thus see.

195
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
It's all an illusion.

196
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:26,560
It's a completely mistaken point, a mistaken view, a mistaken direction, that the only purpose of it is

197
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,560
to allow you to keep denying things, so not to suffer immediately, or account of it.

198
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,560
But it's not freedom from suffering, it's just management.

199
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Because in order to deny, well, the fact that you need to deny means you're affected first.

200
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Now you need to deal with it, and denial will be a form of dealing with it.

201
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:52,560
But so do bananas, and then others, they don't have to act upon the unpleasant feeling at all.

202
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,560
They don't need to do anything, on account of unpleasant feeling there's a reason why, because they don't suffer.

203
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,560
They have pulled out the first arrow, so they're not hit by the second arrow,

204
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,560
of needing to do things when you experience pain.

205
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,560
So, psychotherapy, psychology, contemporary Buddhism, every other religion are all forms of management

206
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:19,560
of the suffering, because you don't know the escape from it in the first place.

207
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Thus, your best legal selection is to manage it.

208
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Whether you manage it to explain it in a way, oh, it's my chemical imbalance, that's why I suffer.

209
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Well, it's because my parents were not supportive of me when I was young,

210
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,560
or well, no, it's because everything is not real.

211
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
All of these are mere conventions.

212
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
You think you exist, but you don't.

213
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,560
You think pain is real, but it's not.

214
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,560
All of those revolve around the same thing.

215
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
I don't know the way out of this pain.

216
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:59,560
So, I'm just trying to justify it, try to explain it, blame me externally, but never really understanding it.

217
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Because if you were, then, yeah, parents didn't love me, that's a fact.

218
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,560
But it's not a fact on account of which I have to suffer.

219
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Things are real around real, well, if I, the fact that I can say the things are unreal, that's real.

220
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,560
That designation is real.

221
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,560
So, their lack of reality might pertain to a more particular level, if you didn't know, that wasn't real.

222
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,560
But on a more general level, as a designation, if you just utter,

223
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,560
that you're able to think of, that you're able to direct and designate, it's real.

224
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,560
So, it's a contradiction in terms of saying, oh, this is not real.

225
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Because if it's not real, it just wouldn't be manifested.

226
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,560
You wouldn't be able to even think about it, let alone speak and point at it.

227
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:55,560
So, all of that confusion comes out of the result, as a result of not knowing the way out of suffering that has arisen.

228
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Seeing something arisen, and then trying to make it not be what it is.

229
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,560
And because you're suffering, you got to it.

230
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:15,560
So, it would be as if a person is sick, terminal ill, and there is no parent cure.

231
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,560
So, in the end, he just started denying his illness.

232
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Well, it's not real.

233
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
His life is not real to begin with.

234
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,560
So, it starts dismissing at all, because it's, it alleviates suffering to some degree.

235
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Through bad faith, through ignoring, through turning a blind eye and so on.

236
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,560
It doesn't fix the illness at all. It doesn't affect it in any way.

237
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
It just makes you know, you get it.

238
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,560
And the attitude of not looking is nothing else than the attitude of ignoring.

239
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,560
And ignoring is what a VJ is.

240
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,560
It's not, I think I've said it many times before.

241
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,560
It's not a physical veil of ignorance that is sort of being uncovered one day.

242
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,560
If you were lucky, or if you made enough of the right mystical effort for whatever else.

243
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Ignorance is act of bad faith, act of ignoring, act of not acknowledging, act of assuming.

244
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,560
All of those acts maintain the act of ignorance.

245
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
So, you're fully responsible for the religion.

246
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,560
You're maintaining it in your daily actions.

247
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Obviously, not on a particular level.

248
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Or rather, you won't find it, you won't discern it on a particular level.

249
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
It's there, but you won't discern it.

250
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,560
But you have to discern it on a more general level, which is where it arises.

251
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:38,560
And general level being in regard to the nature of things.

252
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Because you can say this is not real.

253
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,560
The nature of that statement, the nature of that experience is real.

254
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,560
It's manifested as such.

255
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,560
So, that's why all these things need to be allowed to arise.

256
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Why? Because that's where the problem is, in their arising.

257
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
That's why they're impermanent.

258
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
The problem is you not seeing that impermanent.

259
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Thus, you end up putting everything else on the top.

260
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,560
All you have to do is to start discerning impermanence within the heart of things.

261
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Because they have a reason, not because they're ceasing.

262
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,560
And the whole thing will sort of...

263
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Like in the cartoon, when you see a knitted jumper and a cap just pulls one string

264
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,560
and the whole thing just gets undone eventually.

265
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Well, that's exactly the point.

266
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,560
If you get the right one and you stick to the right one, stick to the right view.

267
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,560
It will unravel everything else.

268
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,560
Trying to stop something from going up?

269
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,560
That's good.

270
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Okay, well.

271
00:27:46,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Yeah, but in terms of the nature of things, they're overrides.

272
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:21,560
But if you just leave it as that, you can say it is impermanent.

273
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,560
But you have to know it.

274
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
You can't just naturally...

275
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:34,560
The dammit as the universal law, as the universal path that has always been there can be walked is there.

276
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,560
But that's not to say that you're already walking it.

277
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:44,560
So the impermanence is generally in those things. Because if it weren't, you wouldn't be able to find it there.

278
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,560
But that's the thing. You need to discern it. You need to find it.

279
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Because it's there, that discernment is possible.

280
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
And you'll find that out when you discern it.

281
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,560
So until you discern it, you have to have faith that it's discernible.

282
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
And that you're doing ignorance?

283
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Well, exactly. Because if you're just being with things, you're just being with it, but you're not doing anything.

284
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
So that's why you can't...

285
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Like that's why you need all of these, like, you know, so many sutras and...

286
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,560
And countless numbers of instructions and descriptions and incarnations and pointers and so on,

287
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,560
that the Buddha was going around teaching.

288
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Well, because if you just stay with things, well, you're just staying with your ignorance.

289
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,560
You need to know what to look for.

290
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Yeah. You can't keep throwing more rubbish onto the thing you're trying to discern.

291
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,560
So there is that. There is just staying with the thing that has a reason, not piling up more.

292
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
But then that's just...

293
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Okay, now that you've got it, now you need to start doing the work.

294
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Now that you learn how not to keep throwing more rubbish on your experience in terms of the wrong views and so on,

295
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,560
you learn that. You get established in that.

296
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,560
That's a starting point now, so you can begin a proper work.

297
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Or like you're taking further.

298
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:15,560
But usually people, you will hear, you know, Buddhist monks, archons, whoever,

299
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
that's what everything will come in it.

300
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,560
And every religion teaches that in one form or the other.

301
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Just sort of either through denying the world or whatever,

302
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,560
but you arrive at the point of just being with things and that's it.

303
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Just let it flow.

304
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Just let it flow. Just be here now, present, aware in the present moment.

305
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Don't judge. Don't do this. Don't do that. Just be. Just be.

306
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Just be, feeling to see that, yeah, good.

307
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Now that you're just being, you have to start discerning that very just being a problem.

308
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
That's where the problem is.

309
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Everything else that you thought the problem was was just extra.

310
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,560
On top of your problem, there was preventing you to see it.

311
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Now that you learn how to just be mindful and simplify your life,

312
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,560
that's like before you begin the practice.

313
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,560
So it's a prerequisite.

314
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,560
It's not to be confused as a final goal.

315
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,560
I mean, it's so far from it that it's just like, it's still wrong.

316
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,560
You're still protruding and you can still be just present with things with your protruding mind,

317
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
with your protruding ignorance.

318
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,560
And you can spend your whole life because ignorance, one, can't get undone by itself.

319
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Because it's not there by itself, you're doing it.

320
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,560
So you have to learn how to stop doing it and that's how it's done.

321
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,560
So if you don't learn how to stop doing it, you just be, you're just being with it.

322
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Yeah, that's the point.

323
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
That's you, you're doing it.

324
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,560
It's not doing itself. It's not faster upon you.

325
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Ignorance is not given to you.

326
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Yeah.

327
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
By maintaining it.

328
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Exactly.

329
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,560
In the same sense, again, ignorance or whatever, any other awesome states you want to pick up

330
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,560
from the sutras, it's over where that craving is.

331
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Or rather, it all shares the nature of that very craving, which is something you're doing in regard to things.

332
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:12,560
So in the same sense that you can say craving is the reason for your suffering, the direct reason for suffering.

333
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Not that on account of which you crave, which results in suffering.

334
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,560
So nothing external is the direct reason for suffering except your craving in regard to it.

335
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,560
In the same sense, you can say ignorance is the reason for suffering.

336
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Nothing external, but your attitude in regard to the external, the attitude of ignoring,

337
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,560
the attitude of turning up like the attitude of bad faith.

338
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,560
That's the reason for suffering.

339
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,560
It was a very distinct, this couple in Norway.

340
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,560
I think it's in Norway.

341
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,560
The government said that they need to register a baby.

342
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,560
They need to register a baby's name and refuse to do so.

343
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,560
So they were fined.

344
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,560
So they were forced to go and register the name for the baby.

345
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:11,560
So they called it B-X-J-A-I-Z-Z-I-2-T. Like it's 21-Lets.

346
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
There's a nurse ridiculous.

347
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
You need to register a problem.

348
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
It's too long as two.

349
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,560
So put A, another find the game.

350
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,560
You can't just call it A, you have to give it.

351
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:31,560
So there's an example that they were trying to get away from this whole institution, this whole society,

352
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,560
because that's the problem.

353
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,560
That was the cause of the assault.

354
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,560
I think that's why they suffer.

355
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,560
So they're not going to let their child go to the same society.

356
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Fending to see that, showing the society is another attitude towards the society,

357
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,560
which in this particular case resulted in even more hassle for which they felt fully justified

358
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,560
in their anger and in a well because they, I'm sure, they thought they were right.

359
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,560
They're just equally deluded as the society that is put into name now.

360
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Because there was never a problem.

361
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Never a problem was no issue.

362
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,560
But yeah, it's a very common view.

363
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:22,560
As I said, in other schools of Buddhism, or other schools of Buddhism today, or other religions,

364
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,560
that's the most you can get, deny the reality by one mean or the other.

365
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Why?

366
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Because you mistakenly blend it from the start for the reason that you're suffering,

367
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,560
and denying of it removes the apparent reason of your suffering.

368
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
But it doesn't.

369
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
You're still, you're still able to suffer.

370
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,560
So you're just a management that it's a response.

371
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
And there isn't suffering.

372
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
It's not uprooting it.

373
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
It's not dealing with it.

374
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,560
It's not preventing it to arise in the future.

375
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,560
You, like you can spend your whole life managing your suffering.

376
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,560
At the end of it, you still remain prey to suffering as much as you were in the beginning.

377
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,560
You have not affected a grain of that nature of being prey to suffering,

378
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,560
being liable to suffer.

379
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,560
Because all you've been doing is managing the actual suffering,

380
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,560
or the prospect of actual suffering.

381
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:26,560
So it was like, you can also go and just ignore as hard as you can.

382
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Yeah.

383
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Oh.

384
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
You know, the mystical illusion.

385
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
Yeah.

386
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Really enjoy the suffering.

387
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Really get into it.

388
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Yeah.

389
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,560
So it's not a problem anymore because you really want it.

390
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Yeah.

391
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
You force yourself to want it.

392
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,560
All of that is a secondary attitude or other response.

393
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Because you can't handle it.

394
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,560
In regard to the fact that it has a reason and you were affected by it.

395
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
So whether you're accepted or rejected.

396
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Both accepted and rejected.

397
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Neither accepted nor rejected.

398
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Because there's nothing to accept nor reject.

399
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,560
All of those will be a form of response,

400
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,560
a reaction to the fact that it has a reason and it's struck you.

401
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,560
And the fact that you have no option but to respond.

402
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,560
But to react means you're striking yourself second time on account of it.

403
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:43,560
So if one has the understanding of such a plan.

404
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Of such a plan.

405
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
The things are not mine.

406
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Well, has that understanding of another?

407
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Not self.

408
00:36:50,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Then what stops him from not doing whatever he wants?

409
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Whatever.

410
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Is there a sort of mine?

411
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
Well.

412
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,560
So he'd abandoned his responsibility towards things.

413
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
He already comes it.

414
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Yeah.

415
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Well, it's an experience of liberation.

416
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,560
But the burden is laid out.

417
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
It's whether we compare it to the burden.

418
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
It is.

419
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
Yeah.

420
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
You overcut it.

421
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Imagine.

422
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,560
As the sutras talk in the hands of Janas and similar.

423
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
You were imprisoned.

424
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Your family left out there.

425
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
And you were it because you feel responsible.

426
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Well, you're not just like your family.

427
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,560
You're fully thrown through, taking them as yours.

428
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
But you're knowing control over it.

429
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,560
So you're imprisoned and you worry.

430
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
What are they going through?

431
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Are the bad things going to happen?

432
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Are they going to lose them?

433
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Are they going to kill or rape?

434
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Who knows what?

435
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,560
And then you go out and you find them intact.

436
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,560
And then the relief from that burden of their responsibility

437
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,560
that you had no input in.

438
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
You feel.

439
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Or crossing that there's all of those other similes.

440
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
So it is.

441
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Generally feeling like laying out a heavy burden.

442
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
And it's a good question.

443
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
What stops him from doing it?

444
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Nothing stops him.

445
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,560
What stops him is the requirement of seal of being established

446
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,560
first before the Dharma takes place.

447
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,560
Because there was established when the Dharma took place

448
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,560
and the self-view has been abolished and so on.

449
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,560
He can't revert back to those things

450
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,560
that were requiring that self-view

451
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
which was the unwholesome behaviors.

452
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,560
So he sets it up.

453
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
But then exactly.

454
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
He lets go of that as well.

455
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Which is letting go of seal of the Parmasa.

456
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Letting go of virtue and duty.

457
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,560
And that's an extreme relief.

458
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,560
When you lay down your duty.

459
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,560
You don't have to do anything.

460
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Expand yours to have just sleeping.

461
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Some people say to you.

462
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
But what about your mother?

463
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
She's suffering.

464
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
And you should go in the past.

465
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,560
Because they're still speaking out of their self-view.

466
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Out of their sense of duty, they're still burdened by.

467
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
But it's making me suffer.

468
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
They are sufferers.

469
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Exactly.

470
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
They do it because it's their person.

471
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
But obviously somebody can misinterpret this

472
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
and say, OK.

473
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,560
So you just start denying everything and say,

474
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,560
this is real, this is real.

475
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,560
This must be lacking to whatever one with what people do.

476
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
But no.

477
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,560
That's why the order is not negotiable.

478
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,560
The order of things.

479
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Seala comes first.

480
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Then the Dharma can take place.

481
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Without a sealer, whatever took place,

482
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,560
you can be sure that it's not the Dharma.

483
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
So.

484
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
And they always say that.

485
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,560
The Buddha, when he talks in the sutras,

486
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,560
when you would say, then in the center,

487
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
that the knowledge has been developed

488
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,560
because his behavior has been purified beforehand.

489
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,560
So whatever he understood, he understood because, OK.

490
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,560
He really made the effort to understand

491
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,560
and his behavior has been purified beforehand.

492
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
He has a sense of shame.

493
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Exactly.

494
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Yeah.

495
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
And then.

496
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,560
So.

497
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
The center of shame and fear of wrongdoing and the whole sealer,

498
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,560
it's not the Dharma.

499
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,560
But it's a necessary ground for the Dharma to take place.

500
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
And when the Dharma does take place,

501
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
you abandon that ground as well.

502
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
That's why, you know, practicing them,

503
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
you go beyond good ambiance.

504
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,560
But I mean that that ground gets undone.

505
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
No.

506
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
No.

507
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
It stays.

508
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
Because they always will be a ground.

509
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
You prepare it and now you take off.

510
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,560
And that ground is left.

511
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Obviously, there are different, you know,

512
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
different people, different grounds,

513
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
different levels of preparing the ground,

514
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
different habits, different sound.

515
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,560
So there are many different areas in the suitors,

516
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,560
getting up to all sorts of relatively serious mischief.

517
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,560
And which is why they're sort of the good or the least things

518
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
that sort of one I cannot do.

519
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,560
And there's no mention that he's not able to break any of the precepts.

520
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
What sort of one I cannot do?

521
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Well, the person who has prepared the ground

522
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,560
and then left the ground laid on the burden

523
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
does not care anymore.

524
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,560
He can't kill the Buddha.

525
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
Kill another hand.

526
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
Well, he could have killed his mother.

527
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
Kill his father.

528
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,560
He can't take any determination as permanent.

529
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,560
Any determination is not suffering.

530
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,560
He can't take any reason, Dhamma, as his self.

531
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,560
He can't take anybody else other than the Buddha,

532
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
as his teaching.

533
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,560
And that means he can't take any other teaching,

534
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
completely different to the understanding of the Dhamma,

535
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
as a teaching.

536
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,560
So his criteria of the Dhamma is so established

537
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
that if he comes across any other teaching,

538
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,560
it will only be, ah, this occurs to the Dhamma or this doesn't.

539
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,560
But he can't stop and then start something completely different.

540
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Those are the things that he can't do.

541
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,560
He can break, he can lie, he can cheat, he can steal,

542
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,560
he can break all the precepts.

543
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,560
I suppose even if he's pushed in some extreme circumstances,

544
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,560
he might be able to kill as well.

545
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Not just, not that he wouldn't, um,

546
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,560
reap the vipakas or subtractions.

547
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,560
But, um, it wouldn't be, as the Buddha said,

548
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
it wouldn't be as bad as the other,

549
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,560
the other forms, like, as you know, when you have a,

550
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,560
you have a little cup of water and you drop one drop of dye,

551
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,560
everything is dye, black, you just put black.

552
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
But then if you have 100 liters of water,

553
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
one drop of dye will make a difference.

554
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,560
It's still a drop of dye, a stain, impurity,

555
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,560
but because things have changed,

556
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,560
that's why he can't be lower than a human.

557
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,560
He doesn't say what kind of human?

558
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Like, if he has been a very misbearing sort of guy,

559
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
most likely it's going to, it's still be a human,

560
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,560
but probably in a very, very bad, bad state,

561
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
bad position, bad so on.

562
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,560
But the thing is again, somebody will drive you

563
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,560
to go to such an extent of killing,

564
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
it's a big stretch, not impossible,

565
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
because the Buddha didn't list it as impossible,

566
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
but quite unlikely.

567
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,560
But all of the other things are sort of smaller nature.

568
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
That's still very much.

569
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,560
So there's a fear, if you say that there's not mind,

570
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,560
or you have that realise that you become a subsequent,

571
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:33,560
but then you have a responsibility to another person,

572
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,560
say a child, whatever person,

573
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,560
and you fear that if you lose that sense of responsibility,

574
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,560
that this child will suffer,

575
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,560
and account for that, because you won't feed it anymore.

576
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,560
So there's a fear of losing all sense of shame.

577
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
Oh, please.

578
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,560
Well, that's exactly why these things are a burden,

579
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
are a yoke.

580
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,560
That's why family, friends,

581
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
duties and responsibilities,

582
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,560
they're like ties, they tie you.

583
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,560
They obstruct you for that reason,

584
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
because it's not easy.

585
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
Why? Because, yeah,

586
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
you need to realise your own child,

587
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,560
your own children,

588
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
their wealth, anything.

589
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
You need to leave the whole thing,

590
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
yet your success is not guaranteed by doing that,

591
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
because that's only a preparation,

592
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,560
that's only setting up the ground.

593
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
There's no guarantee you'll succeed,

594
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,560
yet, if you were to succeed,

595
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,560
you do have to leave it completely,

596
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,560
utterly, 100% beforehand.

597
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,560
You're right.

598
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,560
That's why they wouldn't, you know,

599
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,560
they're not going,

600
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
not, not, not, not,

601
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,560
they refuse in the beginning to teach the householders,

602
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,560
because they would understand that,

603
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,560
and they would take it on,

604
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,560
as, you know, obviously,

605
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
a worth thing to do,

606
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
and they would leave the families,

607
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
they would then go through ruin and die,

608
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,560
and, you know, no man in the house,

609
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,560
and that's it, they're done.

610
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,560
So it would affect lives of many people,

611
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,560
so they said,

612
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
okay, well, don't teach it.

613
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Like, if they find out,

614
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
and they don't find,

615
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,560
but don't be directly responsible for that,

616
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
just because it will affect other aspects of the order,

617
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,560
and people are hating,

618
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,560
or whatever,

619
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,560
and so on.

620
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,560
So in the long run,

621
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,560
you'll see it's better.

622
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,560
But still, like that,

623
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
it's just like, you know,

624
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
to be coming out on something,

625
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
but there are many sort of punishments

626
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,560
back in the Buddha's day,

627
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,560
they would just lay householders.

628
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,560
And when they were in the Buddha's father,

629
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
came to him,

630
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,560
and his tears upset,

631
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
they stroked,

632
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
because the Buddha took his grandson,

633
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,560
the Buddha's son,

634
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,560
Rahola.

635
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,560
So imagine his state of mind,

636
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,560
and then the Buddha coming down,

637
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
and then getting the teaching,

638
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
and then he understood,

639
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,560
and he became a sotapana,

640
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,560
right there and then.

641
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,560
And then he said,

642
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
okay, well, thank you.

643
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
I do have to go,

644
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
because, you know,

645
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
we always are very busy,

646
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
and so,

647
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
I have things to do.

648
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,560
Sotapana said that,

649
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,560
I've only become a sotapana.

650
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
So it's not that big a deal,

651
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,560
but in a sense,

652
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,560
it is.

653
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,560
But in another sense,

654
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,560
it isn't.

655
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,560
Because there's still a lot to be done.

656
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,560
How can we see the downman

657
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,560
by contemplating designation?

658
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,560
What is another word for designation?

659
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,560
By contemplating that designation

660
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,560
is not a problem to begin with,

661
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
you will learn to allow

662
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,560
those more ambiguous,

663
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
less palpable phenomena,

664
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
so to speak,

665
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,560
such as designations and turns,

666
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,560
and signs and tokens,

667
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,560
to exist,

668
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
to arise.

669
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
By not allowing them,

670
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,560
you don't see them,

671
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,560
or rather,

672
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
by thinking they're the problem,

673
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,560
by denying them,

674
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,560
by blaming them,

675
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,560
by undoing them,

676
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,560
by whatever else people would do.

677
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,560
Means you wouldn't see them in the nature,

678
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,560
which means you're not seeing the nature of phenomena,

679
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
which means you're not seeing

680
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,560
the nature of arising.

681
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,560
So,

682
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,560
you could see the dharma

683
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
by learning how not to interfere

684
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,560
with the designations

685
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,560
and what they designate.

686
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:34,560
By not maintaining the blame on them

687
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,560
for your suffering,

688
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,560
but by learning how to leave it as it is,

689
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,560
then eventually you'll see

690
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,560
where the suffering does come from,

691
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,560
which is not them.

692
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,560
For as long as you think they're the problem,

693
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,560
you'll be trying to fix them,

694
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,560
which means you'll be misdirecting your efforts externally,

695
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,560
outwardly.

696
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,560
Not recognizing that there is a further suffering,

697
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,560
as the sister,

698
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,560
Roger Dunn said,

699
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
merely the suffering arising,

700
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
suffering standing.

701
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,560
That's what the problem is.

702
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
So,

703
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,560
you don't have to worry about designations,

704
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,560
as long as you're not spending your time blaming them

705
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,560
for your suffering.

706
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,560
And saying,

707
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,560
well,

708
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,560
I don't exist anyway.

709
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,560
My name,

710
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,560
my ethnicity,

711
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,560
my nationality,

712
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,560
just empty convention,

713
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,560
it's not real,

714
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,560
thus,

715
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,560
when I experience pain,

716
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,560
that's not real either.

717
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,560
That's a completely gratuitous connection,

718
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,560
and it doesn't work,

719
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,560
which is why it doesn't feel from suffering.

720
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,560
So, that's how.

721
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,560
The designations cover quite a domain.

722
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Normal.

723
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,560
Well,

724
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,560
there is no just normal,

725
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,560
or there is no just Rupa.

726
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
So, everything is designated,

727
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,560
that's what I'm saying.

728
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,560
That's what I'm saying before.

729
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
Even you saw,

730
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,560
like,

731
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,560
I'm not calling this,

732
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,560
and you just called it,

733
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,560
like,

734
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,560
like that.

735
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,560
I'm not going to giving any name to this.

736
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,560
You just name this as such.

737
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,560
So, name,

738
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,560
as a name of matter,

739
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,560
it's not optional.

740
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,560
So, I'm doing the name.

741
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,560
It's ridiculous.

742
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,560
You cannot do the name

743
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,560
or you cannot do the form.

744
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,560
Because it's not you're doing anyway.

745
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,560
Yes.

746
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,560
Designation is not you're doing.

747
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,560
Even if it's in regard to it,

748
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,560
it is.

749
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,560
But to see that,

750
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,560
normal Rupa,

751
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,560
not just normal.

752
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Yes, there is no just normal.

753
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
I mean, you can discern the aspect of

754
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,560
normal in normal Rupa.

755
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
In the same sense,

756
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,560
you can discern the resistance aspect

757
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,560
of Rupa in normal Rupa,

758
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,560
but there is no just normal just Rupa.

759
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,560
And normal Rupa would,

760
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,560
in other words,

761
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,560
it's the all.

762
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,560
There can also be appearance.

763
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,560
Everything that appears,

764
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
exactly.

765
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,560
But,

766
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,560
with wrong view,

767
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,560
it exists.

768
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,560
When it says,

769
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,560
the all means everything.

770
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,560
From things that's seemingly more material

771
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,560
to like, you know,

772
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,560
vague and biggest abstract thoughts.

773
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Again,

774
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,560
that's as a designation,

775
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,560
it has its matter,

776
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,560
which is right here

777
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,560
and then the presence of that living body

778
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,560
or whatever else.

779
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,560
The experience has a whole

780
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,560
number of Rupa remains,

781
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,560
and you can't even

782
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,560
conceal that now being so.

783
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,560
No,

784
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,560
yes.

785
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,560
Designation is just,

786
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,560
it's not just label.

787
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
No.

788
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,560
It's a label.

789
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,560
It's a designated designation.

790
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,560
Are you labeled it intentionally

791
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,560
intended something,

792
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,560
decided on top of the already

793
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,560
inclinations that you had?

794
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,560
Oh, you think that's a label?

795
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,560
Oh, this is,

796
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,560
I call this table.

797
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,560
I label it as such and such,

798
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,560
in such and such regard.

799
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,560
So that's just like a very proliferated designation,

800
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,560
you can say.

801
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,560
It still shares the same nature of designation.

802
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,560
And if you realize the nature of designation,

803
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,560
you will realize that labeling was never the problem.

804
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,560
It's kind of inevitable.

805
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,560
If you abstain from the label,

806
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,560
you label it like that.

807
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,560
In the same sense,

808
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,560
you can't stop choosing,

809
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,560
can't stop making decisions,

810
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,560
receiving.

811
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,560
You can't stop receiving.

812
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,560
You can't stop feeling.

813
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,560
Or you can do is,

814
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,560
step outside of the whole thing.

815
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
Or I would not step outside literally,

816
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,560
but surmount the whole thing,

817
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,560
so you're not affected by it.

818
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,560
And as the weather said,

819
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,560
even the target that uses designations

820
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,560
such as I am,

821
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,560
I am this, I was like that.

822
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,560
But he does not confuse that designation

823
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,560
for his sense of self.

824
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,560
It does not stand anymore

825
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,560
for the wrong view of the self.

826
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
He is clearly there.

827
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,560
So now it's a true,

828
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,560
just an empty designation,

829
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,560
in that sense,

830
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,560
not empty of everything,

831
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
empty of its reality.

832
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,560
It's empty of appropriation.

833
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:04,560
So when, so when,

834
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,560
I saw his bonuses,

835
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,560
not mine.

836
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,560
He doesn't take that,

837
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,560
knowledge as he is.

838
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,560
But therefore in our hands,

839
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,560
he doesn't say not mine.

840
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,560
He doesn't have to say that.

841
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,560
He doesn't have to say that.

842
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,560
He doesn't have to say that.

843
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,560
He doesn't have to say that.

844
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,560
But what puttuja Nakando,

845
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
he can deny the whole world,

846
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
say it's not mine.

847
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,560
But what he cannot see

848
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
is not mine,

849
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,560
he's actually denying the whole world.

850
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,560
But as though he can see himself

851
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,560
with not self,

852
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,560
he can see not self with self.

853
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,560
He can see himself with self.

854
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,560
But he can't see him not self with not self.

855
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,560
So then again,

856
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,560
which is why he's suffering?

857
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,560
Yeah.

858
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,560
The male what arises,

859
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,560
it's not appropriation.

860
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,560
It's not his.

861
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,560
So he sees not self,

862
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,560
not self,

863
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,560
not self.

864
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,560
And he needs to persist in it,

865
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,560
so the things

866
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,560
won't even arise anymore

867
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:15,560
with the author of self.

868
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,560
That's the standing of determining.

869
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Yeah, you can say so.

870
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,560
And if you were,

871
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,560
because if you were not able to designate,

872
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,560
you'd be dead.

873
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:03,560
But that's not Nirvana.

874
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,560
And actually there is that,

875
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,560
that sort of, yeah,

876
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
it says if an infert,

877
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,560
if the consciousness turns away

878
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,560
from the name and form,

879
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,560
wood.

880
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,560
Oh yeah.

881
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,560
It's based on the resistance and designation.

882
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,560
A lot about that.

883
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:38,560
Yeah.

884
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,560
With name and matter as condition,

885
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,560
consciousness.

886
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,560
So it was said,

887
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,560
how it is, and under that with name and matter as condition,

888
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,560
there is consciousness.

889
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,560
It should be seen in this manner.

890
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,560
Even on the consciousness,

891
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,560
but not to obtain a stay in name and matter,

892
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,560
wood future arising,

893
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,560
coming into being of birth,

894
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,560
aging death,

895
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,560
and pleasure suffering,

896
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,560
be manifest,

897
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,560
you wouldn't.

898
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,560
So therefore,

899
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,560
that's the reason,

900
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,560
that's the occasion,

901
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,560
that it's the arising,

902
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,560
that this is the condition of consciousness

903
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,560
that's the same name and matter.

904
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,560
Thus far and under,

905
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,560
may one be born,

906
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,560
or aged,

907
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,560
or die,

908
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,560
or fall,

909
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
that's far,

910
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,560
is there a way of designation,

911
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,560
as far as designations can go.

912
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,560
Thus far there is a way of language,

913
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,560
thus far there is a way of description,

914
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,560
thus far there is a sphere of understanding,

915
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,560
thus far the round precedes

916
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,560
as manifestation in a situation.

917
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,560
So far,

918
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,560
that is to say,

919
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,560
as there is name and matter,

920
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:36,560
together with consciousness.

921
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,560
And for other rounds,

922
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,560
like here at the end of the day,

923
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,560
they say the same name.

924
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
They say the same name,

925
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
but they might.

926
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,560
Yeah, well, the faculty is a different,

927
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
more limited and so on,

928
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
so they wouldn't have...

929
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
They don't have the confidence in themselves.

930
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,560
The theory of awareness.

931
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,560
Yeah, but,

932
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
animal,

933
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,560
they might not be able to speak,

934
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,560
but they have,

935
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,560
that which stands in the form of speech.

936
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,560
The sounds they make,

937
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,560
the expressions,

938
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
and it's a form of,

939
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,560
it's much more obviously crude,

940
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,560
simpler, more general,

941
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,560
animal,

942
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,560
but the far hungry,

943
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,560
it's a far hungry,

944
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
and the round,

945
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
be it a deva round,

946
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,560
or the,

947
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,560
or the,

948
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,560
animal round,

949
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,560
or the hero round,

950
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,560
there is no.

951
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,560
Absence of,

952
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,560
well, like,

953
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,560
oh, I have only two aggregates,

954
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,560
but something on it.

955
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,560
Just the far right,

956
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,560
it's the nature of things.

957
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,560
It's just their composition,

958
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,560
the ways of going about,

959
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,560
might be different for an animal,

960
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,560
than a human,

961
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,560
which is why an animal

962
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,560
is more unfortunate,

963
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,560
than a human.

964
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,560
But it's still the same deva.

965
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,560
And that's why,

966
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,560
it's,

967
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,560
it's such a perilous round

968
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,560
to be an animal round.

969
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,560
You don't have awareness

970
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,560
of your choice,

971
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,560
yet you are choosing,

972
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,560
and you're fully responsible

973
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,560
for the results of that choice.

974
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
So an animal can't help,

975
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
dog can't help but chase after things,

976
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,560
or hunt things,

977
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,560
cat can't help but killing.

978
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
But it's still responsible for it.

979
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,560
Doesn't mean,

980
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,560
oh, it can't help,

981
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,560
it's not a fault,

982
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,560
it is a fault.

983
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,560
The far right,

984
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,560
it's a,

985
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,560
it is a form of choice.

986
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,560
Yet,

987
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,560
there is not enough awareness

988
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,560
for that choice to be recognized,

989
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,560
so they just go

990
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,560
with the most obvious inclination

991
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,560
that they would have,

992
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,560
which is why it's so hard to step

993
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,560
outside of the animal round,

994
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,560
because you're just perpetuating

995
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,560
the bad action,

996
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,560
action,

997
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,560
action fully immersed,

998
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,560
in greed,

999
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,560
aversion, delusion,

1000
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,560
completely.

1001
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,560
So you would really need

1002
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,560
an external circumstances,

1003
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,560
a stroke of luck

1004
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,560
to get back from an animal round,

1005
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,560
for which,

1006
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,560
you're responsible going to,

1007
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,560
in the first place,

1008
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,560
through your bad actions

1009
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,560
in other,

1010
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,560
better out.

1011
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,560
And that stroke of luck

1012
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,560
is basically,

1013
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,560
that simulator

1014
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,560
of the blind third

1015
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,560
coming up,

1016
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,560
once every 500 years,

1017
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,560
to the top of the sea,

1018
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,560
just for a second,

1019
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,560
and sticking its head

1020
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,560
to a yoke

1021
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,560
that's been floating around

1022
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,560
and thrown around

1023
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,560
by winds and waves.

1024
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,560
I mean, what are the chances?

1025
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,560
And those are the chances

1026
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,560
of somebody

1027
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,560
from an animal round

1028
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,560
to come back.

1029
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,560
So that's why, like,

1030
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,560
there is some, like,

1031
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,560
looking after an animal,

1032
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,560
helping an animal,

1033
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,560
feeding it,

1034
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,560
does, in a sense,

1035
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,560
like, by making an animal

1036
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,560
restrained itself.

1037
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,560
And nature restrained

1038
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,560
is there,

1039
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,560
in its behavior,

1040
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
and it's such,

1041
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,560
it will count,

1042
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,560
bit by bit,

1043
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,560
eventually,

1044
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,560
in the future.

1045
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,560
Yeah,

1046
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,560
they're not,

1047
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,560
they're not,

1048
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,560
they're not,

1049
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,560
they didn't willingly

1050
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,560
choose that restraint.

1051
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,560
By the fact that the restraint

1052
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,560
was imposed upon them,

1053
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,560
in the sense of weight

1054
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,560
before you jump on your food.

1055
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,560
Means, there is a phenomenon

1056
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,560
always strained present

1057
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,560
in their experience

1058
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,560
right there, right then.

1059
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,560
A wholesome phenomenon present.

1060
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,560
And what I said,

1061
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,560
in these unwholesome rounds,

1062
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,560
like,

1063
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,560
completely always in darkness,

1064
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,560
even a tiny little spark

1065
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,560
light can mean,

1066
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,560
a lot.

1067
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,560
That's what I look after, though.

1068
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,560
In cats,

1069
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,560
in a bird,

1070
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:29,560
in a monkey.
