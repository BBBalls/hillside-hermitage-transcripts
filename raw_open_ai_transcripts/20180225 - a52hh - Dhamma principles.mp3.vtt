00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
those within that and you pull it apart.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Of the random operation of all,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
you can't even put your arms up.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
That's it.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
You cannot see remaining alive.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
So if the body, the material aspect, the flesh aspect,

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
the hoop bar gets deformed, destroyed,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
they cannot remain any consciousness in regard to it.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
So that's how you recognize that then your eye,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
your nose, your ears are that ultimate away from you.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Then you just have obviously been appropriate for so long,

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
and it's so close that you can't see it.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
So then you just assume it's in you, it's yours,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
and you have the result.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, it's kind of the expression of you, so to speak.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
But if you start to see that when you think about the eye,

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
it's the certain expectation that they will find

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
a real eye somewhere else.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
But you want.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Thoughts you have about the eye are all you can have about the eye.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Because I myself, it's always going to be ultimate negative,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
and it doesn't appear.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
So what appears is that because of which there is sort of appearance,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
and that's determined by that eye.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
So even when you think eye, you have to stop regarding that

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
as a real eye or as a non-real eye,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
or as both real and not real, you can just recognize,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
I can only have thoughts that stand in place of an eye.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And when I say an eye, that's another thought that stands

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
in the place of an eye, which is another thought,

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
which is another thought.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
So you can never access the eye.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
You can only be a second sort of to it.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Whatever thought, whatever abstraction,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
whatever is going to be secondary to it.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And that's all it's necessarily to recognize that

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
because then you see, oh, by being inaccessible,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
you cannot even conceive ownership of it.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
And Bande can you even access thoughts?

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, exactly. Then if you start refining that principle further,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
I mean, it's relatively refined when it comes to body,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
it's the same principle that comes to mind,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
but it's much harder to see, as the word has said, himself.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Because putution can get rid of the body.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
So do, do, do, do, do.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
If you extend the same principle,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
then you realize that thoughts themselves,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
in their nature arise on their own.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
You sort of manage them, you intend upon them,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
but that intention is secondary to the arising of thoughts.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Thus, intention shares the same nature of,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
cannot be owned.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Because it's founded upon things that are inaccessible to ownership.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And that's how the mind gets free from the suckness,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
conceding, and becomes an utterance.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
So then you can think and will, and still not own it,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
while you're willing and thinking and deciding,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
and telling off, and whatever else,

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
what you do, you have to know about it in a way.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
It's the same principle, but it's much harder to see it

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
on the level of the mind,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
but if you see it on the level of the body thoroughly,

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
then yes, it's far from impossible.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Because that's the whole point.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
It's, it's used spinning over,

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
in the same sense that after all,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
that spills over the five aggregates, and owns them.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Once that's gone, well, then you still have perceptions

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
in regard to the sense basis that spills over,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
that assume the access to the eye to the nose

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
hence the sensuality.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Because the only benefit of central sides,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
that benefit can only pertain to the flesh eye.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Nothing else can benefit from sight.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Skin and the sense of touch can only benefit

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
from touching things.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
You, you can't access that.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
But by fully assuming access to the body,

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
to the eyes, you have been drawn

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
by that which these things want.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So then you think you are accessing

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
all the external sensuality.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
You are touching pleasant objects.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
You are tasting pleasant sounds.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Sorry, pleasant taste.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And you're hearing a grieble sound.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
No, ear is hearing the sound.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
It cannot be different.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Eye is seeing the sights.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
But you, when you say eye,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
you assume the eye.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Hence, you are pulled by the sights.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
So that's why the mindfulness,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
this mindfulness I'm talking about,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
peripheral, or letting in the ear is necessary

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
because you never see a connection

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
between your thoughts about the eye,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
your sights, the lip.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
And that indirect, fleshy organ

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
that is simultaneously present

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
because of which all of this is possible,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
that in return defines that, which is an eye.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
That's why the sense base is defined

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
by the sense object.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
In itself, you can't even conceive.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
The extent of it.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
But if the mindfulness is developing

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
the way we're talking, yes,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
then you would be able to hold the thought

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
of the present organ of an eye

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
because of which I'm thinking of an eye

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and doing all of this without leapsing,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
without either jumping too much

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
onto the external notion of the eyes

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
or thinking of, you know,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
is this eyes in me, I am basically.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
You're able to see both ends

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
without kind of sort of snapping towards one,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
if the mindfulness is developed

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
to the extent necessary basically.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Like, you know, like a rubber band,

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
sort of you stretch yourself,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
well, it's either going to sort of snap

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
from this end or from this end.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
You won't be able to kind of include both ends.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And both ends are included through development,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
through discernment of enduring

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
endurance of the simultaneous theories

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
and two things, right?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Basically, it's a simultaneous present.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
For that, you basically need mindfulness,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
without mindfulness, you cannot do anything.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Just impossible.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Because mindfulness does not necessarily bring knowledge

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
unless you know where you're supposed to know.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
But certainly, without it,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
there is absolutely no basis for any discernment.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
But if you already have discernment,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
then all you need is the practice of mindfulness.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And satipatana is enough for somebody

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
who developed you.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
That's the only way that will lead to

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
full purification of the being

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
and anything else.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Here's a good describe.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Because what else would lead to the full purification?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
No, no, no.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Then just sticking to that clear vision

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
and developing it to the extent necessary.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
What I've thought about from time

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
is the assumption of that something,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I think it's in context of what Nanda says,

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
the eye is that in the world,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
which my specific theory,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
there is always a assumption that, you know,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
there is vision,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
but there's also behind that.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Sure.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
You assume that spatiality.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
That's what it ends up with.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
The assumption is the spatial kind of being.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I am here and things are elsewhere.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So you can't stop that.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
But when you do have such thoughts,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
you start including them

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
in that proper mindfulness of knowing

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
that all of that is possible

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
because there is the actual operating flesh of an eye.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
That you also know at the time

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
that you're thought in regard to it.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
But it's an accurate thought

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
because it doesn't consume it anymore

07:16.000 --> 07:37.000
as that hidden entity in the hidden place.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
In my mind,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
because if I was studying Nanda here,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
it's kind of the explanation of the body

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
and that's one letter we're doing in the height of it,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
it's kind of things.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And that's the thing

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
that we've given first experience of the whole.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
And then within that,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
you discern that here and the younger people

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
prioritize the here and the younger that are seeing there.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah, and then when they think of there,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
they think in some terms

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
of like a third of the younger,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
they think of that level.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Instead of seeing that both are possible

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
because there is already there.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
And that's the basis of an unknown that there.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
That's it to get so off

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
and this can seem too pretty.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Oh, very neat.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
It's possible to see.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
You can see it.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Yeah.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Thanks for my hot seat method.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
We need you to, I remember.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And you're according to the sutra.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Yeah.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And by using as a breathing,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
watching, watching breaths,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
you can, you know that the body is there.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
This is, this breath is happening.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
You can.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
That's why the body, the breathing is,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
it's kind of symptomatic.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
It's bound with body.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
It's just inconceivable,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
one without the other.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It can't feel.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
The body is there.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
The breathing is there.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
The breathing is there.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
The body is there.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
But they're not the same thing.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And then that body.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It is just looking at one aspect of the body.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, the breathing is there,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
then that body can be manifested as the body,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
as the healing, as the thoughts are,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
as any other thing,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
within the principle of two symptoms,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
they need to present things,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
while you're breathing.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
So you can focus on the body aspect of breathing.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
But still not see the actual relationship.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
But yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
But you can keep focusing on that breath,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
but you've got to see that relationship.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
That's why it's there.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It's a successful body.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
It's completely unnecessary to be focusing on anything.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
But yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
It actually takes your way.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
But just, you can use the breath as one of those things.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
You can just...

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Stereas.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Stereas.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
They're breathing at once.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Yeah.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
It's like the intention to bring in a mindfulness

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
in the actual,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
or actual breathing.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And if you look at the intention to breathe so much,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
the intention is there.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
But this particular...

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Miles.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
And so it's beyond mind control.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Or this...

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
This...

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Pleasurable.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Yeah.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Experience.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Breath.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
By the presence of this.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
The feeling of this.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
The feeling of this.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
What is that?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Yeah. That's how you start including your volition.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
But that's volition.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
And it doesn't start introducing the ignorance.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Because volition usually comes from the center.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
So it feels...

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
So when we will,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
we engage in the center self.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But I choose to breathe slowly,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
because I think that's already there.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
It's actually to give a possibility,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
based on the simultaneously present and breathing.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
That's possible.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
So you...

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
I choose to...

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And then you realize that I choose to...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It's already because of that.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
So then you stop it here and do it.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
As mine.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
It's fiction.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I went from my mind to this.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
When you say, like,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
there is control and a lack of control.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I think I can choose how to...

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
I can choose how to breathe.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
The old thing, I can't choose.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
And the breathing is possible.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
And when you fully get rid of the slightest assumption

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
of control outside of the lack of control

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
to a tiny degree or something,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
then you fully stop the assumption

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
of an external entity that controls it.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
But it seems that that agent said that

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
there is not necessarily for this sense of self.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Because it can be completely paralyzed

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
and still consider you're willing to be...

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
You're willing.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
The will of the mind.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
That's ultimately mind.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Speak fully.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
That's how the will of life is.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
That's why the action,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
the three-time selection.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
So you can be paralyzed,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
but it can still be very much willing.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Ah-ha.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Having a mind,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and perpetuating the same type of mistake.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Just to the self.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
But it just won't plan anything.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Sure.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Because as this stops being usable,

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
because it can't.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
But it still won this early.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
That's why a parallel expression

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
does not automatically become an error.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Because you remain ignorant

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
just on a different level now.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
You cannot express your ignorance

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
in a bodily way in the past.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
But if you want to speak...

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
If you want to move their eyes

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
and procreate that.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Sure.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Even if the only thing you say,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
you lose everything.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
You won't result in the bond.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You will result in the rebirth of another

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
being affecting the religion.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
So you need to do that while you are alive.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Get the mind out of that.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Self-centrements are discrete.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
That sense of error.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And then the river can also affect you.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Even this is suicide.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
You can't actually kill.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
You can't.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yes, so for an argument.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Like for example, he can't kill himself.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Only acts.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
He's sort of...

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
is to prevent body from trying to exist.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
But that's not a suicide.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Suicide is when the self-centre person

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
well, attention to kill himself.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
And kill themselves by killing the body.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Because you can't kill yourself directly.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
You can just kill your body

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and then you wait for death to come.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, that's what it is.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
You can just make the body dysfunctional.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
But then the death of the body

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
comes from the complete direction

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
of you and you don't have access to it.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah, sure.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Like you don't even...

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Yeah, exactly.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
That's why you kill the body

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
hoping that that will result in death

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
because that's what you see in heavens.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
But when death does come,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
it doesn't come from the way of...

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
you kill the body.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
It comes from the way of the mind.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
That's what that is.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
It comes from way behind.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
So let's speak.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
That's what conclusions are always swept

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
with the death.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Like always swept through the flood.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Swept.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
I mean, it just comes from behind

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
and takes you where you're going to see it.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
But for another one who has developed

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
that direction of death,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
that direction of...

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
not adhering to anything,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
seeing... seeing impermanence

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
and everything, basically,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
seeing that nothing is his,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
when things do get swept away,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
he's not there to be swept with it.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And he has absolutely

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
inconceivable to fear death

14:30.000 --> 14:58.000
because it's not death for him.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
You think it is as we can try,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
but because it's...

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And I think that's what you work

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
and show their last...

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
however...

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
A terrible problem.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And also, yeah, that's another assumption

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
that, you know, when you see somebody,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I don't know,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
they're shocked in the head

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
and anything at their dead.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Their body is gone

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
in terms of its functionality.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
But from their point of view,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
mentally, death,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
might be lasting much, much longer.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Once the body is killed,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
that's what death sets.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And we all assume,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
automatically,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
based on the observation

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
that it's instantaneous.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
But whenever the Buddha wants

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
to emphasize that,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
that the extensive pains,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
he would say,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
pains like those of dying

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
or death.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
And then he would say,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
oh, okay, yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Probably it's one thing

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
that body dies instantaneously.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
And once that happens,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
then the experience of death begins.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And it's horrible.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Respect for the mind that...

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
It's here.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It looks at the mass of your life.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
There is the feeling that

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
you're living with breathing,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
and there is another feeling

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
that you're living with the body.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Right.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah, I don't remember that.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
But you still breathing,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
but still alive.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Right, right, right, right.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah, sure.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Sure, sure.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
I feel of feeling terminated

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
of life first and then.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Yes, you're right.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
You're right.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
You're right.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
You're right.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Are you?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Yes, you're right.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Oh, they're very, very good.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And then this life itself.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And that's the one that can last

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
for probably quite a while.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Okay, imagine part of your brain

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
something on the floor,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
and still feeling...

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
So you have been sort of withdrawn

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
from, because it was destroyed,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
the past six cents a base.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Except, you don't have these

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
excesses anymore.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Of eyes, nose, and stuff.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Now, you're just being sort of

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
crushed from everywhere, basically.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
The mind is dying in itself, down here.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And, you know, there's another suit

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
where it says, like, that the suit

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
upon a based on his insight,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
he can become an other hunt.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Again, that's commentary

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
at the moment of death,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
like the mind moment of death.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
The moment of death,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
it's the extent of the experience of death

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
that can endure.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
For how long?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Well, you don't know.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
So sort of going to keep you coming

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
out of hand during that time,

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
which now, when you think about it,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
makes sense, actually.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Because it's all instantaneous.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It's a period of complete,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
crushing destruction of the five

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
upgrades that he has full understanding of.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
What's going to result in full dispassion?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
There is nowhere for him to adhere

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
to distract himself from.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
All he has left is his right view.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
So he can easily become an other hunt

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
in the moment of death.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
He said, if he doesn't become an

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
other hunt while he's dying, basically.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Mentally, he can become an

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
other hunt while he's in interval.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
When he's neither there nor born yet.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Then he can become an

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
other hunt.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
The third type is upon landing.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
That was a translation.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And he can become an other hunt

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
in that next life,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
or then eventually in the seven lives.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So you realize it's not seven.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
He can become an other hunt in any time.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Up to seven.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah, up to seven.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
But these kind of intervals

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
in between, and stuff,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
you realize this whole notion of

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm alive, I'm alive.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
The moment of death, I'm born again,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
die, born again.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
The interval can be an event

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
before you're born again.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Hence the sense of urgency.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
You have no idea how long you'll be dying.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
You've had a very long time.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
There is that kind of assumption

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
that it's like, you know,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
like people speculate about

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
like reverence,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
like someone died in 1973.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Even born in 1973.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
It might have been the rebirth

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
of that person.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Sure.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
No, it's fully based

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
on a gratuitous,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
based on an external perception

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
of death,

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
the kind of just switching of the body.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
That's it.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Because that's all you can see.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
And you never experience

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
yourself differently

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
to be able to tell

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
that actually it's not just that.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Yeah, it's in the similar way

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
like it's being born.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
You cannot really say

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
when the person is born.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
You can't say that.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
You can't.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
You only know that someone

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
is pregnant

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
and then somebody comes out.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
And consciousness is already pregnant.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Because imagine like

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
in a medical school, you know,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
like in a Czech Republic,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
the abortion is legal up to three months.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah, it's the usual.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
But imagine if it's actually

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
it's a real human being.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
It is.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And you are just the whole life

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
sitting down as a doctor.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
The thing is,

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
that the Chinese friend of yours,

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
yeah, he must have it.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
But the thing is like,

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
even though, say,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
even if you're not,

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
because the Buddha said

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
when the human being

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
does kind of descend,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
which is when embryo is born.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
So already the conceiving of embryo

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
means conceiving of life.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Yes.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
They dismiss that because

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
it's just an embryo,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
it's a cell.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
So they can arbitrarily decide,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
or three months,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
it's a however,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
even when you do abortion of a fetus

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
or for one month or two,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
you are cutting a body inside.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
That's how they do abortion.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You start chopping it inside

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
and then pulling parts

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
two months.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
So it's not a fetus form,

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
yet you still see

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
little arms and stuff.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Or recognize,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
this is an arm.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
This would have been an arm

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
in a week.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
It's already an arm.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
So even people who kind of

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
medically sort of thought

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
that you have a certain

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
heavy amount of denial

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
that this is just,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
this is not the way

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
being I'm killing.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
It's after the third month

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
that it becomes alive.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
It's completely stupid.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
It's terrible.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I think they focus on the,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
you know,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
it's the one,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
like we were giving women

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
the choice aspect.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Sure.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
They focus on like,

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
oh, this is my job.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
I just do that.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
It's on my phone.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Yeah.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Where they give their justifications

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
of, oh, you know, this person

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
with great tiredness,

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
pregnantness,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
immoral kind of abortion.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Yeah.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
You can even kind of

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
sympathize with it almost.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
But you can be quite a serious

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
killer.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
I'd be like,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
a hundred and a hundred.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
So, yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Yeah.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Boy, Chinese children.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
They're one child.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
They're one child policy.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
And the story.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
So you imagine how many they

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
get pregnant a second time?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
She was doing like,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
in the height of some days,

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
or something,

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
ridiculous, like,

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I have a memory of saying

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
thirty in one day.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Thirty a day.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
They say it was ten.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
And in a month.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
You can say,

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
you killed 300 people.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Imagine that coming.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
And she said,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
she would sleep at night

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
and just have,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
with visions of,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
after one,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
blood.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Right.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
And this.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
She said, no,

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
but it's okay.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Because they do it

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
chanting after.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
So all the notes,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
as they get together,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
for each mother,

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
who's chanting.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Like, somebody's chanting

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
and they go,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
what's next?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
But they know.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Very well.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Like, this is something

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
wrong.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
That's why they're chanting.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
That's why they're chanting.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
That's why they're chanting.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Yeah.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
So, you're singing about

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
300 people.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Thousands, thousands.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
One after a year.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Oh, it's quite.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
And the Christians

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
in America,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
some,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
wrongly,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
but they still recognize it.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
It's not a good thing

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
that they go too far.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
They would kill the abortion.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah, they killed the doctors.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I'm reading about it.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
You get the bombings

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
of it instead.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
She was.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
In the name of God's moral

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
will forever.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
There it is.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
And there it is.

22:33.000 --> 22:41.000
Get all the more.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
But it is, it is a,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
it is a useful reflection as

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
well,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
to stop associating death

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
with the death of the body.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
And see something that comes

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
from the ultimate inside,

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
so to speak.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
You can't,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
in the same sense,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
you can't conceive,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
the sense organs,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
the direction you can't access

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
them,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
you're just because of them.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Well, death

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
speaks them.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
It means you have no,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
you can't,

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
you can't have a relationship

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
with death,

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
because it doesn't come

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
from any direction

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
that you can possibly conceive.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
But you can also, basically,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
you should,

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
basically we should say that,

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
you know, because it's

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
now my Rupa,

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
it goes together,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
they die together.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
So even if you like,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
say the bullet comes

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
or goes through your head.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Yeah, that's not the only Rupa.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
But there is the particular,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
other parts of the body,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
which I would say.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
You don't have any parts of the body.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
There is a body.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
On the basis of the general Rupa.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
On the basis of which,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
they give you a consciousness.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Yeah.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
So when this body is destroyed,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
that's, there wasn't your body

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
upon which you were really existing.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
There was just a more particular

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
manifestation of the form

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
upon which your consciousness was existing.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
That's where you can transcend your body.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
You can fly out of your body.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
And that's why,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
if you die with ignorance,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
you get another body.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
You get another particular manifestation

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
of the same form.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
So that's another important thing.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
The form that you depend upon now,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
where you're bound with Rupa,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
is the same one.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
You depend upon previous life,

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
and previous life,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
and previous life,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
and previous life.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Despite having different bodies

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
and different particular forms,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
the nature of the five aggregates

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
remains the same.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
And the Buddha said that,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
even if a monk recollects one past life,

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
he'll 500 of them,

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
or he recollects,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
is these five aggregates,

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
or one among them more particularly.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
But that's it.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
That always remains the base.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
And that's it, because again,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
people think,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
this is a journey.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
You're just passing

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
from this life into the known.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
This is always what's present,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
has always been present.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
In that other sense,

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
the five aggregates.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
That's why you keep remaining,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
being born.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Not because you keep traveling,

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
because you keep holding on to the same thing.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
So now,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
the stuff you're holding,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
is the stuff you've been holding,

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
beginninglessly,

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
for billions of years of time.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
And it's right here,

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
right now,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
can be freed from.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
In that sense,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
it's a calica.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
But again, people have the linear assumption

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
of death,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
rebirth, elsewhere,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
and this,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
and it's a journey,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
and you come to know,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
it's right there.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
That's why, if you stop associating death

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
with that kind of movement,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
you realize,

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
ah, death, basically,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
death doesn't take away the five aggregates.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It takes away your dependence

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
upon the particular manifestation of the senses

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
of the five aggregates and so on.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
So what you have to do to be free from death,

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
but really,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
is free yourself from your senses,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
and then eventually,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
from the conceit in regard to the ideas,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
and you'll be free from death,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
and you'll be free from rebirth.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
From this very same present principle

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
that we were talking about,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
of mindfulness and simultaneous presence.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
It's not, you know,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
above it,

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
or below, or later,

25:46.000 --> 25:53.000
or before.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
And that's how you cannot possibly

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
be affected when illness affects the body,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
breaking apart,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
death,

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
loss of limbs,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
loss of senses,

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
which is,

26:04.000 --> 26:19.000
because you are not in that particular manifestation of it, you know.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
That's why I also,

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
when we were talking about it,

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
there were the madness.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Like,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
if the body starts

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
losing the balances

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
and doing things that are not,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
the weird is that,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
you wouldn't have personal problem with it,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
because it's not yours.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
If there was wisdom,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
there was knowledge properly established,

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
you just, like,

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
without a jar like,

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
oh, honey,

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
you're actually not making sense.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
You stopped engaging in that kind of outlet or speech.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
It's not,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
it's not yours to begin with,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
so it's not an issue.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
So you couldn't possibly be denying it

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
or having a problem with it,

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
if everybody says,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
oh, that's, that's, yeah,

26:53.000 --> 27:05.000
yeah, that's how this body is acting now.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
And can this happen to other half?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Well, I think that,

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
well, like, say,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
loses mind,

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
how do you,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
how do you,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
look like a mad person?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
I think theoretically,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
it could,

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
yeah,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
but that doesn't mean,

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
what,

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
what it can never be compromised,

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
like externally,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
he could be mad,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
and say that man disappears

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
and people tell him he was mad,

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
yeah,

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
he would probably already know that,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
and he wouldn't have an issue,

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
again, same with other child,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
he didn't realize

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
because of the stroke,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
he was thinking one thing,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
he was thinking he was saying one thing,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
he was saying something completely different,

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
completely,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
but there should be,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
like,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
in that I had some emotions

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
should be missing,

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
like fear or,

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
all of that is missing.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
He cannot be afraid,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
he cannot suffer,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
he's absolutely fine,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
because he's not afraid of death.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
He's not afraid of death.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
How can you be afraid of losing

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
the speech mind

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
and bodily activities?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
He cannot be his concern.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Well, he cannot lose,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
is that purified,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
freed point of view?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
So even if madness

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
becomes his reality,

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
basically,

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
but even that reality

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
is equally affected

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
with non-Avija,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
he's fully understood.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
So he might not be able

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
to express it anymore

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
because the speech is

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
slurring,

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
the chemicals in brain,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
they were helping perception,

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
just don't work anymore,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
just perceiving things differently,

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
and stuff.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
There is his reality.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
But still, he would not engage

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
like an animal,

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
some activities,

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
basically,

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
attacking people

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
or being aggressive

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
or disfigured.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
He would be just mad,

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
and...

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
What is it?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
It depends.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I don't know.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Because aggressive behavior

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
is not necessarily

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
the sign of real will.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Yeah.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
But the more serious issue,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
it's not aggressive behavior,

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
it's denial

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
of when these things

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
were pointed out,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
it's that kind of almost

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
conceited refusal.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
No.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
I cannot get mad.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
I'm not mad.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
That's an issue.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Yes.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Even if he was punching people

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
in the face before that,

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
then we're not necessarily

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
being an issue.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
In the same sense,

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
there was that other hand

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
who was like,

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
oops.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Like the whole province

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
got upset in monks

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
because he was rude,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
really abrasive,

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
telling people off,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
just calling other monks,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
shavelings,

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
just horrible,

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
and people complained

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
to the Buddha.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
And they would have called them.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
He was a big issue,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
and then the Buddha

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
saw he was actually an

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
other hand,

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
fully enlightened.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
But he was reborn,

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
he had the habit,

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
basically.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
He was reborn like

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
over 500 lifetimes

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
in a high ground in February.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
But I think he was not

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
so rude actually.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
I read that story.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
He was only called them

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
like a...

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Well, no.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
That's what the story

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
would always condense

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
the meaning as he called

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
them shavelings.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
But you can imagine,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
if the point came

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
when the whole area

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
complained to the Buddha,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
and the Buddha had to call

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
him for that.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Like, he wouldn't

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
have like one man

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
got upset.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
You call him in sharing

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
and then the Buddha

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
saw on him and said,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
no, he was a big issue

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
because he was going

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
around doing it.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yes.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
And people said,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
no, the kind of monk

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
is that.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
So you can extrapolate,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
relatively accurately,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
that actually was probably

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
many ways.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
But then the Buddha said,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
no, he was just

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
he was used to talking

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
down to people.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
But I can't understand.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
But he was doing it

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
without a real will.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
How he can punch

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
someone in the face of the

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Buddha.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
No, I just said that in theory.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
No, no, no.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Like, you madness.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Like, you really,

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
you don't, the way your

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
perception goes messed up

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
with the chemicals

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
in your brain and

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
everything else,

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
you don't necessarily perceive

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
him as a human anymore.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
And you hit him.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Oh.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Hit it.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
And then afterwards,

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
they tell you,

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
you punched this monk

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
in the face.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
You would not be denying.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
That's my whole heart.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Yes.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Like a transparent person,

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
which is the basis of

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
wisdom, transparency,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
is mindfulness,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
will not be denying it.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Even if the most horrible

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
stuff, so to speak,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
you wouldn't be able to

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
deny it.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Yes.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
And you wouldn't have a

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
reason to deny it,

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
because it's not personal.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Yes.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
It's not personal.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Yes.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
That's why,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
that's why you wouldn't,

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
you know, you don't have,

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
that's our heart,

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
is as in private,

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
so in public,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
in terms of his behavior.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
He has no, like,

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
oh, this is really good.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
You know, when people

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
sometimes are that

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
regard personally,

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
some weird stuff.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
It's actually so big

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
about it.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
It's nothing personal.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Like, you need to hide

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
about it.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Why would you be hiding that?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Yes.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
And most people do.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Most people,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
like, like,

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
lay people out there,

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
have a lot of stuff

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
like that.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Yes.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That it's kind of, you know,

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
why?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Because it's taken personally.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
That's the sole reason.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
So that's more of an issue.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Yes.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Not the actual

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
manifestation of behavior,

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
because you know,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
even in the,

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
in the rules,

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
often,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
if somebody is possessed

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
with the madness,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
he's exempted.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Exactly.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Yeah.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Which means he could have done

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
serious offenses,

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
but he was a genuine

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
madness.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Means he wasn't his

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
intention of doing.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
That's funny.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Yeah, except, say, if he does

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
something like

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
women, rapes,

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
rapes of women,

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
that is.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
He's not purergic,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
because he needs

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
a man.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
He's completely mad,

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
yeah.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
His last thought,

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
sense of, like,

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
so his point of view

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
was not involved.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
So to speak,

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
his individual was not

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
possessed.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
But,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
if when that's done,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
he's just this full-on,

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
you know,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
rude or aggressive denial,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
and like,

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
no, no,

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
high and beyond all of that,

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
then he's just like,

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
well, not that.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Now, that's not

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
meant speaking,

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
because it shows,

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
basically, some

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
thinking is done.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
At some notion,

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
at some idea of yourself,

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
and that's the definition

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
of conceit.

32:33.000 --> 32:39.000
I don't know.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Well, even if you say,

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
you know,

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
like people say,

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
you're mad,

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
you can't agree

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
on the terminology,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
well, I wasn't mad,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
he was yak as possessed,

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
my mind.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Who's made me see those things?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
But if people say,

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
well, yeah,

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
you were mad,

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
you wouldn't be arguing the

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
point.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Okay, yeah.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
That's how you can

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
call madness, sure.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
But he wasn't.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
He doesn't affect

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
your personal image,

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
unless there is an

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
image that you hope

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
personally.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Yeah.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah, he was

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
shitting,

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
pissing himself,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
that's the whole point.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
The point

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
of being yours.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Because, you know,

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
it can happen to anyone

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
anytime.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Yeah.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Absolutely.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
I'm not sure that

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
tomorrow you will not

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Well, always,

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
you get that

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
cephalitis,

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
and you start

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
really turning into

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
completely different person.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
But your point of view,

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
can ever go down

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
if he has the

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
relevant wisdom,

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
because it's independent

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
of the content,

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
of the quickness

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
of the intellect.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
That's what my opponent

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
says.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
You can be, you can

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
become stupid,

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
you can have a stroke,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
you can also think,

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
and that dimension,

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
you know,

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
remains completely

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
unaffected.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Yeah.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Because if I was,

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
you know, being rough

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
as people in my 30

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
years of my life,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
maybe before that,

33:54.000 --> 33:54.000
it had a

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
strong,

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
but then, you know,

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
okay, I can't

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
down with it,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I can't mind it.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
And these things

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
got, you know,

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
they got

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
something in mind that

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
had my team back in.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Sure.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Because it's been done

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
much longer.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Okay.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Yeah.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
That's just the way it's

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
been.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
But as I said,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
the point of view

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
that has been purified,

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
that it has no

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
will there,

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
or lost around

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
it.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Yes.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Is the relationship

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
of, like, with the eyes,

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
for example, you know,

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
I can think of,

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
an image of my eye,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
kind of thing.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
I assume it applies

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
just at a much more

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
subtle level

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
to the monolendama

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
that gives me

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
a monolendama.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
You can think of

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
some vague

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
notion of what

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
is my,

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
like,

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
it's a sense

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
of an image of a brain.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Well, my

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
there's a sense

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
where it's defined by

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
the dharma that you're

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
thinking.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
So it's a negative

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
in regard to that particular

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
thing.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
So it's, yeah,

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
it's the same.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
So then, when you do have a

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
thought about the negative

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
particular thing,

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
but you realize that there is

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
a negative in particular

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
that thought.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
So you want to make sure

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
that the thought

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
about your mind,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
itself, as,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
actually, this is

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
what the mind is.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
I'm mind,

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
and this,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
you don't confuse

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
yourself that you're

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
thinking about,

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
because it's

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
another thought.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Exactly.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
So that's what you have

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
to do.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
It's not like to figure it

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
out,

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
or to catch it,

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
just to stop

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
misconceiving it.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
That's the whole point

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
of the whole monolabarianism.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
So maybe we can only say

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
that mind is only that

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
which can think

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
thoughts.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
That's exactly why,

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
yeah, that's why

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
you can free your mind

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
because it's there

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
anyway, anyhow,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
on its own,

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
by itself,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
that's exactly the reason

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
why you can

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
equilibrate it.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
It's like, you know,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
if you can, you know,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
you can kind of say

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
that anyone, you know,

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
is here,

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
things are yonder,

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
like, yeah, sure,

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
but then you go

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
to the mind,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and they kind of

35:56.000 --> 35:56.000
just assume it's all

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
true.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
There is no yonder

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
in the mind.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah, that's the confusion

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
really.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Stop.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
They're thinking

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
at that level.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Yeah.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
But they're here

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
and yonder in the mind,

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
too.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
You need more negative

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
to anything else in the sense

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
of it.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
That's why you can

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
see if the

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
thinker,

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
like, you can see the

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
seeer, you can see

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
the hearer.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
And that's exactly why,

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
even if your senses

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
are taken away from you,

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
they're conceived to the

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
remains.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
This is perhaps

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
going a little bit

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
away from, you know,

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
a dama principle

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
thing.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
But I think it's

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
interesting and important

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
to think about just

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
because of how

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
often it's brought up,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
is, you know,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
the mind,

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
it's not to say it, like, you

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
know, people

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
are studying neuro

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
chemistry, great.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
But it's not to say

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
that it's like,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
there is no

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
effect on particular things

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
because of things

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
in the range

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
that people go

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
to far and assume that

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
else is just a

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
manifestation of the

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
brain.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
People go to far

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
basically and then

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
they describe their

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
point of view and their

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
responsibility to that

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
in the brain.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
And that's not the

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
case.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
The results, the

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
chemicals in the brain

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
can present you

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
with things.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
But it's a new

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
basically to keep maintaining

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
ignorance in regard to

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
the reason things

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
or knowledge in regard

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
to the same.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Same with the eye,

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
it is, it is, it is,

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
then chemicals

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
in hormones.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Yeah.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
But people say that

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
as if, like, oh,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
it's because of it,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
nothing has

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
happened.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Yeah.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
We say that

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
correlation is not

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
causation.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Cozation.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Yeah.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
It's definitely

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
correlated.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
I was thinking back

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
the days when I

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
used to take antidepressants

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
things.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Yeah.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
I can kind of say I

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
just, like, things presented

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
themselves, you know, perhaps

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
more pleasing way

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and fundamentally do

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
anything.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
No, exactly.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Exactly.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Exactly.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
That's why you can't

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
treat depression

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
as a state of mind.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
So then you can make

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
choices.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
They will take you out

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
of depression.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
But that's not how

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
my business presented.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
It's presented as treatment

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
all such and such states.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
And you can't do that.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
One last one for me,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
is this, because I've read it

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
so many times, and I just

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
never really

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
entered it.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
There's a lot of times

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
in the suitors, or it's

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
like that, but I've

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
mentioned that he and his

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
disciples, like, they

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
don't get arguments

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
in quarrels in terms of

38:26.000 --> 38:37.000
in terms of views and stuff like that, especially in the new suit and hip-hop, the transition that comes up a lot like, you know, I'm gaining and disputes and stuff.

38:37.000 --> 38:47.000
I'm having trouble, like, I guess, understanding that, what are the same to understand that there is right things and wrong things.

38:47.000 --> 38:59.000
No, that refers to his disciples, which means he refers to the noble disciples. So that's the point, basically.

38:59.000 --> 39:06.000
They might be disagreeing in a particular explanation or description of something.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
But fundamentally, if these two people both are taking the right view, they will have to agree.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
So it's like an internal, that external kind of thing.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
Well, no, even externally, it cannot result in an external, you know what I'm saying?

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
Like, not getting into, like, an argument from random ramen with weird views.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
Oh, yeah, I think, I don't know. You read it yourself, but I thought it's referring to the internal.

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
To the actual, his disciples among himself are not arguing like other sects.

39:37.000 --> 39:45.000
Because you see that in other suitors when they praise, and I see all these disciples always in Concord always sort of sharing the same views and taking it.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Unlike when I go there, they're arguing, attacking the teacher, and I say this, you say that.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
You have the book here.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
But you know, I don't know what's the impression I've got.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
But either way, either way. They cannot argue among themselves.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Right.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
If they have a right view, nor will they go into an actual dispute with somebody else on account of it, impossible.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Like, if another person comes, asks, he gives a speech, they disagree.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Like, it's absolutely not my problem, and certainly not me.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Or nothing that I need to defend will convince you.

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
Like, always, even when the Buddha was teaching something, there's like, no, they would check their head in disapproval and say, well, yes, okay, must go down my go.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
And the Buddha couldn't care less.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
So, while he says, ah, he didn't accept what I said. He didn't believe me.

40:30.000 --> 40:36.000
And then he would go to another people who can't approve his view.
