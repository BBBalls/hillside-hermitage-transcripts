00:00.000 --> 00:11.720
Again, this is the Angutra, Bikku is possessing three qualities Bikku is practicing the

00:11.720 --> 00:17.000
unmistakable and has laid the groundwork for the destruction of the tanks.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.640
While three, here are Bikku guards the doors of the sense faculties, observes moderation

00:23.640 --> 00:32.640
in eating and is intent on wakefulness. And then it's number one. And how Bikku does

00:32.640 --> 00:38.640
a Bikku guard the doors of the sense faculties. Here having seen a form with the eye, Bikku

00:38.640 --> 00:44.720
does not grasp its marks and features, since if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad

00:44.720 --> 00:52.720
unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him. He practices restraint over

00:52.720 --> 00:58.280
it. He guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard

00:58.280 --> 01:03.600
a sound of the ear, having smelted odour with the nose, having tasted a taste. With the

01:03.600 --> 01:08.760
tongue, having felt attacked our object with the body, having cognized the mental phenomenon

01:08.760 --> 01:15.760
with the mind. Bikku does not grasp its marks and features, since if he left the mind

01:15.760 --> 01:21.120
faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.200
Bikku practices restraint over it. He guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint

01:25.200 --> 01:30.200
of the mind faculty. It is in this way that the Bikku guards the doors of the sense faculties.

01:30.200 --> 01:38.200
It's in terms of sensual restraint. And that seems to be the groundwork to begin practicing

01:38.200 --> 01:46.800
a supermeditation, or wanting to be free from sensual irritation. So that you don't,

01:46.800 --> 01:52.240
you don't necessarily have, you don't at all have to go and seek out beautiful objects.

01:52.240 --> 01:58.880
And then practice this supermeditation. All you need to do is practice sensual restraint.

01:58.880 --> 02:08.280
Because the whole mind is already geared towards the mistake of sensuality. So even if you're

02:08.280 --> 02:12.680
not actively seeking things with your senses, the mind and the thoughts and the way of

02:12.680 --> 02:17.200
learning, it's already implying sensuality. So that's why you don't need to go and

02:17.200 --> 02:22.200
prove to yourself that you just need to keep restraining until the knowledge in regard

02:22.200 --> 02:27.880
to the nature of sensuality has fundamentally unattractive develops. And then of course

02:27.880 --> 02:34.400
you won't have to prove anything because you've done it. That's how you go beyond senses

02:34.400 --> 02:40.400
when you lose any form of concern with them, towards them, including concern of proving

02:40.400 --> 02:50.280
that you're free from concern in regard to them. So if a thought comes up and image something

02:50.280 --> 02:55.440
that you attract to you, which will inevitably happen exactly. So in order for those thoughts

02:55.440 --> 03:01.320
of sensuality to become apparent, the actual senses must be well restrained beforehand.

03:01.320 --> 03:05.520
That's why the winner, the sealer, comes first and that whole thing. So what you're saying

03:05.520 --> 03:11.320
is to actually see the signs and features of it. Exactly, because sensuality is rooted

03:11.320 --> 03:15.440
in those thoughts, but you're not seeing those thoughts because you're immediately out

03:15.440 --> 03:21.280
with the senses seeking the pleasure. So that's the whole point of restraint. Like really

03:21.280 --> 03:25.760
I'm wavering the strain, like you don't give in because if you do your undermining your

03:25.760 --> 03:31.760
own clarity in regard to your own sensual thoughts, which means every time you give in,

03:31.760 --> 03:37.160
you sort of induce more obscurity that you have to undo later. So that's why like seeing

03:37.160 --> 03:43.560
the danger in the slightest fault. Because you know how hard it is to purify it and then

03:43.560 --> 03:48.720
how hard it is to maintain it pure, yet that purity is necessary for any sort of insight

03:48.720 --> 03:54.080
that you can develop in regard to the root of sensuality, which is the level of thoughts.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.400
So if you want your thoughts, sensual thoughts to become apparent, to be seen through, as

03:58.400 --> 04:03.600
founded upon the unattractive, the senses, the actual senses must be fully, fully restrained

04:03.600 --> 04:10.800
beforehand. Then the mind becomes clearer. The mind affects the sensuality, the sensual

04:10.800 --> 04:17.160
intent and so on. Or you will, the same. It becomes clearer when the body and the senses

04:17.160 --> 04:26.440
have been restrained beforehand. So there is absolutely never a reason to give in to

04:26.440 --> 04:34.140
non-restraint. If it's non-restraint means it's not done. Obviously, just restraining

04:34.140 --> 04:40.840
senses in itself will not result in you understanding sensuality either. You need to know what to

04:40.840 --> 04:46.080
look for, how to look for, what I described in the previous talk. You have to see the

04:46.080 --> 04:50.600
unattractive basically in the heart of everything that's attractive, always. Like attractive

04:50.600 --> 04:55.800
cannot step and become independent from unattractive. But if you don't see that, then yet, sense

04:55.800 --> 05:02.000
restraint is good. And your mind will probably develop in various ways, but not to the point

05:02.000 --> 05:07.360
of the right view and freedom from sensuality and so on. For that, you need a bit more.

05:07.360 --> 05:13.000
But none of that will be available to be developed more if you don't have the sensual strength

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
beforehand.

05:15.000 --> 05:23.600
So again, if this sensual thought arises and you pick up the signs and features of

05:23.600 --> 05:30.280
sensual thought, you want to see that that sensual thought.

05:30.280 --> 05:36.240
No matter what signs or features will be picked up, you also want to maintain the perception

05:36.240 --> 05:43.640
of inherent foundations of disgust. So no matter where your mind goes, left or right

05:43.640 --> 05:48.240
with those signs and features and prospects and possibilities, the unwavering perception

05:48.240 --> 05:55.320
of it's still very much always within the container of unattractive disgust. You stop

05:55.320 --> 06:00.240
assuming the external to it. You stop making it independent from any disgust, which is

06:00.240 --> 06:05.520
when the mind gets pulled by a central craving. So that's what I mean. Like you have to see

06:05.520 --> 06:10.600
it simultaneously present, not like going like a method or succession of steps or something

06:10.600 --> 06:11.600
like that.

06:11.600 --> 06:16.160
First, you restrain the senses. That's as much as a method as you're going to get. Like

06:16.160 --> 06:22.640
don't negative method in a sense of you don't engage with a sensuality through your senses.

06:22.640 --> 06:29.800
And then yes, when the mind inevitably thinks sensual thoughts, images, memories, the

06:29.800 --> 06:34.400
signs and features of something, something beautiful that accidentally came across the

06:34.400 --> 06:39.200
sound, the smell, the sight and so on, if the sensor is strained, then that you have

06:39.200 --> 06:44.440
a groundwork now, which is the level of those thoughts that are picking up sensual signs.

06:44.440 --> 06:51.920
So you want to basically learn how to simultaneously see the inseparable basis of disgust in regard

06:51.920 --> 06:57.680
to any possibility of those sensual thoughts. Not this thought, that thought, or this particular

06:57.680 --> 07:02.400
thought, any, just entirely in its nature and its domain. It's fully inseparable from

07:02.400 --> 07:09.200
the unattractive. It's rooted in it, inconceivable from. And that's how you get to know it to

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
discern it.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.400
And then you don't have to keep doing anything because whenever sensuality arises, it arises

07:14.400 --> 07:21.920
with disgusting heart. And you can't want it at all, not even in your imagination anymore.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.480
And that's how you would also understand that all the sensuality that has been in the past

07:25.480 --> 07:29.480
that you did engage in, all the sensuality that you would even get, it's still the same

07:29.480 --> 07:35.560
same nature, same everything cannot step outside of this basis, vessel of disgusted, fully

07:35.560 --> 07:45.040
contained. In the same sense, slightly different than in the same sense, how Atawada ceases

07:45.040 --> 07:50.840
when you see that external to the five aggregates is inconceivable. No matter what self-view

07:50.840 --> 07:54.960
or what I have, what conceit, it's fully contained within the original experience as a whole,

07:54.960 --> 07:59.360
which is the experience of the five aggregates. When you fully discern that, you will eventually

07:59.360 --> 08:03.600
stop assuming any external dimension to it, which is basically the definition of Atawada,

08:03.600 --> 08:07.960
a self that's external, that's independent of the five aggregates. And it's the same

08:07.960 --> 08:14.320
principle in regards to assuming the external, beautiful, independent of the foundation

08:14.320 --> 08:21.840
of the ugly, of not wanted, of this passion, which is why both are on the level of Upadana,

08:21.840 --> 08:34.800
Atawada, and sensual, sensual desire.
