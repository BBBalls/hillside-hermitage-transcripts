1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It seems to be, at all, it's a nice practice, it's somewhat easier.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's not so confusing, just watching the state of your mind.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And then just being honest, this is suffering.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You know, because it's these developments or something.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is what it needs to suffer.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
When I follow this development through, where is it going?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's sort of, by seeing the state of your mind, you don't lose the perspective.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Where does this go?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When you don't see the state of your mind, why do you go with it?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Even if you know it might end up most likely.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, certainly.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And in pain and displeasure and disappointment or whatever.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You kind of go ahead with it because you haven't maintained the perspective

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
through seeing that if you're a general state of mind, there was directing you there.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Not that particular thing.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So, yeah, it is relatively easy.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If a person is honest.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But it's like, you know, different people can find different things easier in terms of practice.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The point is that it's not, I think, as we spoke yesterday.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's not just, well, just watch your mind.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It doesn't really make sense.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, it makes sense, but it's just so general that it doesn't really make a difference.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I watch your mind, well, what can you mind?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But that's the way we spoke yesterday.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
These are watching the state of your mind, means watching the background of your mind,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
which is what Chita is really.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's that peripheral, the general, like mood, cloud, whatever we call it in the past,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that kind of just like a general sort of leaning towards certain directions.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, yeah, that's how you can see the mind in terms of the five aggregates.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Again, as you spoke, it's the most obvious environment.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So, like, I might not have any particular sensual design right here, right now in front of me,

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
exciting or disturbing me, but the background of my mind is sort of affected by that.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's like a cloud of sensuality, big heavy in the background.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Nothing particular manifested, but it's there kind of directing me.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And if people are not mindful of that, they'll end up then particularizing

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that very, like, general cloud of sensuality or ill will, like,

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
data is feeling the bad mood, so they take it out on somebody eventually.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They're very angry, strained.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If they're a bit more restrained, they won't take it on anybody else,

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
but they've just been ill will, like, mood internally.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But it's all coming from the general kind of peripheral sort of background

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
of your particular experience.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And that's where the mind is. That's where you never...

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, just watch your mind, usually people are just looking at what's right in front of them,

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
which means they directly don't see what their mind is, because the mind is not there in front,

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the mind is the background of that.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So, the moods, all of those are kind of a manifestation of that mind.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But if somebody keeps an eye on the general sort of cloud of one's mind,

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that ambiguous sort of pressure, that it's sometimes pleasant,

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
something related, sometimes depressed, sometimes, all of those are, like,

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
phenomena in the same sense as you have things arising in front of your eyes,

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
arising on their own, ceasing, persisting.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In the same sense, the internal phenomenon of your general mind,

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that ambiguous one, arises in the same manner.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So, you have a nest for the latest mind.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's just that always like that.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And now it's present and it's enduring.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's persisting like that.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And while it's persisting in the state of a relation,

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
if you're mindful of it, you won't be taken by that.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If you don't discern that phenomenon of that mind for what it is,

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you will be taken, then you'll be later.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Like, inexplicably, inexplicably, but you'll be all over the place,

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
because you're in a great mood.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Everything is good.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All the nothing has changed, really.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was just your mind.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But because you have no insight or other,

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you have no capacity but to not take it as yours.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You have to take it as yours, because you don't have anything else.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Then you are related.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Then you're all affected.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then everybody's in the same sense.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When they're mind, the acceleration ceases.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And then another state.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Another mind arises, a mind of ill will,

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
or a mind of depression, or a mind of something,

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
then you're completely taken by that.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, basically, you're completely liable to like the swings

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and the swings of that mind, the wider of your mind.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
As if the rain comes, you will completely drench.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The sun comes, you're the best in the, you know,

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you're the greatest in the head.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You have absolutely no shelter from it,

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
because you're just taken by it.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But if you start seeing it,

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
as an equal phenomenon that arises in its own domain of that generality,

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
so it never becomes particular.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The mood always stays in the background.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When it's related, you know it is related.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When it's depressed, you know it is depressed.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And that's actually enough to not be taken by it.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There's like the practice of Saty Patan.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He knows his mind is expanded.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He knows his mind is drunk.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He knows his mind is elated.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He knows his mind is depressed.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If he's depressed, he knows it is depressed.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, it's not, I've been depressed.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The presence of a depressed mind is there.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's it.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then the presence of a different elated mind is there afterwards.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So, it's basically, and it's not,

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and also that's another assumption,

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
to assume that it's the same mind.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That it's being depressed.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because all you're going to have is a state of your mind.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Your experience will always reveal your mind through a state.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And those states are different.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Which means, those minds are minds.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Prodo.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Not at the same time,

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but basically,

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
presence of one mind in that the utmost general level

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
means such and such mind is there.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then another presence of a different mind opposite

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that means such and such mind is there.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And that's all you can truly know.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You assume that it's the same mind yet induced those states.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But when you see that there is no mind being discerned

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
without those states given beforehand,

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you realize,

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
oh, the mind is inseparable from those states.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Thus, the mind cannot be on its own independent of them.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And it's the same sense with the feelings.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When the Buddha said,

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
do you take feelings to be yours?

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like, yes.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's like, well, which one do you take then to be yours?

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Because there is pleasant feelings.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There is some pleasant,

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
there is neither pleasant,

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
there are completely different feelings.

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Separate, different feelings.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So there's no one feeling that then gets kind of

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
turning to the colors of pleasure and colors of this pleasure.

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No, it's a different feeling, entirely different feeling.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And they don't mix, they don't like connect,

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
they don't mold into each other.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So if you have three different feelings,

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
which one is yours then?

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If you have like,

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
millions of manifestations of your mind,

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
which one is yours?

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
None.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
None can be yours.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But you can see that in general your mind is taken by a longing of yours.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Generally, well, I should say.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Not taken by longing,

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
because that implies your mind sits there.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But you can see that the mind, which is a general,

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is a longing mind.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's the depressed mind.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's the happy mind.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's the evil mind.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's the economist mind.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's this mind.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's that mind.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The mind is there.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And if you see there's dependent,

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
or rather as inseparable from the state it has a reason,

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
what you see as it coming from over there,

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
not from over here, I mean.

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So you are just sort of mindful of it.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're just arises, ceases,

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and persists why it changes.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
As any other phenomenon does.

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It shows exactly the same nature.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But on that general level.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have to abandon those things.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When I say abandon,

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
if you know that this longing,

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
you have a longing mind.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, you abandon longing.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, see.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You abandon longing show,

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
but you don't abandon longing

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
by interfering with the longing mind,

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
because there wasn't yours to begin with.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So you can abandon you appropriating the longing,

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the mind that longs,

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the mind that's sad,

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the mind that's happy.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You abandon that.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You abandon the appropriation of that.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And that's a very different thing.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But if you say, oh, yes,

189
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you abandon the longing mind.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If you abandon the longing mind,

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
it means like, oh,

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you must remove the longing from your mind.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And that doesn't work.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's basically,

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the mind is that longing.

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So removing longing from your mind

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
means you still assume that the mind is separate

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
from that longing,

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and then this longing just infected it,

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and then you clear it out,

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and then the pure mind stays.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So the pure mind is mind that's left alone.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The pure mind is the mind.

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's thinking.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Involved.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, you basically discern

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
the impossibility of your involvement

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
in the first place,

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
which is how you stop being involved.

211
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What about seeing your position in regard to the mind?

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Your position.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Meaning,

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you see a mind that's the background.

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Uh-huh.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then everything else,

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
which is more particularly on that.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So you see,

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you're not the background.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, it would allow,

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
like a citizen stepping away,

222
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
from the background of the mind.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So yeah, yeah, it could help.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Because usually people by not seeing that,

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
they're taken by that background,

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
kind of magnetic cloud,

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
it sort of directs them

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
towards either real will,

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
or sensuality,

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
or whatever engines there are,

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
or as all,

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
through like a latent supermoon,

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
happy, happy joyful,

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
whatever.

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But it's basically completely dependent

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
on an utterly randomly,

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
circumstantially,

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
that is a manifested mind.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So that's how you,

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you can basically be mindful

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
through other daily,

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
regardless of where you are,

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
what you do,

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
well, not completely what you do.

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You have to practice restraint, obviously.

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But I mean, like,

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
whatever you're doing,

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
then it's not clearly unwholesome.

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Uh-huh.

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Just by keeping that peripheral eye

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
on the general state of your mind

252
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
for what it is,

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
you already, basically,

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
you're already fortified against that,

255
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that like, uh,

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
pressure,

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that that mind will exert

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
on you to do particular things.

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So the mind,

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that like a general cloud

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
of like sensual craving,

262
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
if you're not,

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
if you're not seeing it,

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
for what it is,

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
as a phenomena,

266
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it will eventually pressure

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
me to particularizing

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
that very craving,

269
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
through either, you know,

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
engaging through any sensuality

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that you can get at a time

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
wherever you were,

273
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
a big full music entertainment,

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
whatever,

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
things like that.

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You would end up going towards that,

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
because you pushed you there,

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
because you haven't been,

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
you haven't been fortified

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
in regard to it.

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But for as long as you remind,

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
like, oh,

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
it's still there.

284
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So like,

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
three hours later,

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
or if you're doing whatever,

287
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
you look,

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
oh, the sensual mind,

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
it's still there.

290
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's enduring.

291
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And it doesn't matter,

292
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
even if it stays forever,

293
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
it's still incriminating.

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You know,

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that it will have to cease.

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So you might like,

297
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
last forever,

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
infinitely.

299
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So to speak,

300
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
there is no end in sight

301
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
when you look at it.

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But the fact

303
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
that it's arising

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
in this manifest means

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that's why it will cease.

306
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So infinite things

307
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
are incarnate.

308
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They will come to an end,

309
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
with their infinity.

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So when the new thing arises,

311
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the new wonder arises,

312
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
the new infinity arises,

313
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and then infinity is also

314
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
impermanent.

315
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So it's like two completely

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
different domains.

317
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There's nothing here.

318
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everything is.

319
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well,

320
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
these things that arise

321
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
always arise

322
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
with the sense of

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
being forever.

324
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No.

326
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They arise with infinity.

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They arise because there's no,

328
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
there's no end in sight.

329
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There's no end in,

330
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
like terms of the possibilities.

331
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's no end.

332
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And that's what's mistaken as forever.

333
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But actually,

334
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you can have an infinite

335
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
range of things.

336
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And then that's taken away.

337
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And then you don't have

338
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
an infinite range of things anymore.

339
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So that's how infinity

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
is impermanent.

341
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So yes, I think I said

342
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that in one way or another,

343
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
if basically if a person

344
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
were able to discern an infinite

345
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
from permanent,

346
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
we'll see.

347
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, discern the difference,

348
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and then you would recognize,

349
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
ah, actually,

350
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
permanent comes from me,

351
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the assumption of permanent,

352
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the assumption of forever.

353
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Infinite,

354
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
it's kind of everything is infinite

355
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
in that sense,

356
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
because everything arises

357
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
with infinite amount of possibilities.

358
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, it arises,

359
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
but when it ceases,

360
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
it ceases with infinite amount of possibilities.

361
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean, new things manifested,

362
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
or other different things manifested,

363
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
also.

364
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So everything arises in that,

365
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
like infinite structure of possibilities,

366
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
like infinite mind,

367
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
infinite permutations,

368
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
infinite design,

369
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
you can be seeking out

370
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and trying to encompass them all anymore.

371
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And you always have the more,

372
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and you'll always be more

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and more and more and more,

374
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and more and more,

375
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and more and more,

376
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and more until it ceases.

377
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So the whole thing,

378
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the entire domain,

379
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
the entire domain of infinity

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
from the past,

381
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
all going to the future,

382
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
that's in permanent,

383
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
that's ceases.

384
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
On a particular level,

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
yeah, things last forever,

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
in that sense,

387
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
in that infinite sense,

388
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
until it ceases,

389
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
on the general level,

390
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
which is where it ceases.

391
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So that's why it's another mistake

392
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
to look for impermanence

393
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and actual, like,

394
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
in actual cessation of things,

395
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
when you look for them,

396
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and you want to see their destruction,

397
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and they're like,

398
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
ah, that's in permanent.

399
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No, that's just another

400
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
a reason thing

401
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
with infinite possibility.

402
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're just witnessing

403
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
a phenomenon,

404
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and a reason phenomenon

405
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
of destruction.

406
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And that has a reason.

407
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So that's why I mean,

408
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
when I say before,

409
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
or I say often,

410
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
things are not in permanent

411
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
because you see them cease.

412
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Things are in permanent

413
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
because they have a reason

414
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
in the first place.

415
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So their manifestation

416
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
means that's why

417
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
they're not in your control

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
because they are manifested.

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You can't even

420
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
concede you creating

421
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
anything,

422
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
you manifesting anything.

423
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Impossible.

424
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And even when you think

425
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
of you creating something,

426
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
if you look closely,

427
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
whatever you're

428
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
kind of working with

429
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
in your mind in terms of you,

430
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
that was given before then.

431
00:15:43,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So you always come in second.

432
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's so abandoning

433
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
the filaments of minds,

434
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
whichever the filaments

435
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
do abandon it

436
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
or not taking it as yours anymore.

437
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Well, just before you go further,

438
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the filaments were basically

439
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
deferred down to the whole range

440
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
or that like a generally affected

441
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
the background of your mind.

442
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's affected by centrality.

443
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
All the wealth into that particular push

444
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that's pushing in a particular direction

445
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
or finding something like

446
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
a particular manifestation

447
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
of that general pressure

448
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
like vague and big use

449
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
central craving

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that you find,

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
okay, you sort of centralizing

452
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
this particular thing

453
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
or that particular thing.

454
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So that whole range

455
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
would be a defilement.

456
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So you can start saying no

457
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
to these particular things,

458
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
sure, that is the first step.

459
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But you should do that only

460
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
so that you can then start discerning

461
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the phenomenon of your mind,

462
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
a reason on its own,

463
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
being affected by such and such

464
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and holds some state.

465
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But if you just go around

466
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
denying the things you need

467
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
onto you,

468
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
fine, but you're

469
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
carrying the very source

470
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
of the problem with you,

471
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
you're not addressing it.

472
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You're not getting involved

473
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
with that sort of thing.

474
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So yeah, seeing it

475
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
for what it is,

476
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
seeing grasping that sign

477
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
of that phenomenon,

478
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
of that mind,

479
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
as a reason in such and such

480
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
way means you're not

481
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
getting involved,

482
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
because you get involved

483
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
by not seeing it.

484
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And that's why

485
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
that the first,

486
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know about that,

487
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
but one, the requisites,

488
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
it's pretty requisite

489
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
for sort of a party,

490
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
as I mentioned,

491
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
was grasping the sign

492
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
of your mind,

493
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
chip the limiter,

494
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
grasping that phenomenon

495
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
of that ambiguous,

496
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
vague cloud of the mind,

497
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
for what it is.

498
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Not only defining it,

499
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
not okay,

500
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
this is what my mind is.

501
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm not just seeing it

502
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
for what it is,

503
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the way it has a reason.

504
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When you start seeing it,

505
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
like the way it has a reason,

506
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
on its own,

507
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and not adding more to it,

508
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
not taking away from it,

509
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
then that phenomenon,

510
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
because it's seen,

511
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
for what it is,

512
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
can't then be understood

513
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
as not mind.

514
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But whenever there is

515
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
a form of involvement,

516
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
then that means appropriation.

517
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So if you like,

518
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
something to it,

519
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
if you take away from it,

520
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
it means you still assume

521
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
that you can't add something to it,

522
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that you can't take away something,

523
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
you're involved.

524
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So then you're not seeing,

525
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
the clear sign of your mind,

526
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
so then you have to make it clear,

527
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
till you see it for what it is,

528
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
arising,

529
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
ceasing,

530
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
persistent or changing.

531
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Or rather,

532
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
persistent or changing.

533
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Because arising is

534
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
persistent or changing,

535
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
ceasing the way it's

536
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
persistent or changing.

537
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah, just basically seeing

538
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the given state of mind

539
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
as not the rules.

540
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah, and you have to see

541
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
that it's better,

542
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
like it's better to be honest

543
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
because you first,

544
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
you get a clearer picture,

545
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
you might see it first time,

546
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but you're never like,

547
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
oh, so at once,

548
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and it was it,

549
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
no, it keeps seeing it,

550
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and seeing it,

551
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
for how long?

552
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, it depends,

553
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
how well established

554
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the assumption of mind was,

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
in regard to that mind.

556
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
For some people it's more,

557
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
for some people it's less.

558
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But I think,

559
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
given that it's done half a million

560
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
years since the Buddha died

561
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and the kind of

562
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
pure dharma,

563
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
this fear,

564
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
it's probably more,

565
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
for most,

566
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
for all the people.

567
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They need to do

568
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
much,

569
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
like lots of

570
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,000
undoing,

571
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
for those assumptions

572
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to disappear.

573
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But again,

574
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that the universal principles

575
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
of dharma,

576
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the path that the Buddha

577
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
himself only discovered

578
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
did not create,

579
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
it's always there.

580
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So even if it's,

581
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
there's no Buddha

582
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
around,

583
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
no dharma around,

584
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
if somebody is repeating

585
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
these things correctly,

586
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
they would,

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
reach the same goal,

588
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
they would,

589
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
abandon the appropriation,

590
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
they would see a mind

591
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
for what it is.

592
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And then the Buddha

593
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
did say that,

594
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
he's like,

595
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm, like,

596
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,000
even put to you,

597
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
as even people

598
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
who don't have the right

599
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
of you,

600
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
who never heard,

601
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
like,

602
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,000
were not establishing

603
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
the right display,

604
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
the right display,

605
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
the right display,

606
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and so on.

607
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Even they

608
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
could actually experience

609
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
this passion,

610
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
this achievement

611
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
towards this body.

612
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why? Because,

613
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
what do you see,

614
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
bodies disgusting,

615
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
who is in,

616
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
getting sick,

617
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
liable to misfortune,

618
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
just anything,

619
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and then see other people

620
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
dying and so on.

621
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If you dwell on the

622
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,000
longing,

623
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
you will experience

624
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
revulsion and disenchantment,

625
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and this experience

626
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
of passion in regard

627
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
to your body.

628
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But it's,

629
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
it's hard,

630
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and it's almost impossible

631
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
without the right view

632
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and right instruction,

633
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
to experience the same

634
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
disenchantment

635
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
towards your own mind.

636
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But,

637
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
in the same sense,

638
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
basically,

639
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you can see that,

640
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you can,

641
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the fact that you can experience

642
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
this passion towards the

643
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
mind is also a phenomenon,

644
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
in the same sense,

645
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
your body is a phenomenon

646
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
towards which you can

647
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
experience that this passion.

648
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So you say,

649
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
it's hard to experience this

650
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
passion of one,

651
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
because the mind is much

652
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
quicker,

653
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
much more ambiguous,

654
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
much more vague,

655
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
much more fleeting,

656
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
changes quickly,

657
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
moves around,

658
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
so you don't see it.

659
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And by not seeing it,

660
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
you are appropriating it,

661
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and you have been

662
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
appropriating for such a lot of time,

663
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
that it's almost,

664
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
like,

665
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
well, it feels almost

666
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
as if impenetrable,

667
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
to,

668
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
to, to,

669
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
like, there is no more choice,

670
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
mind,

671
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
just taking for granted,

672
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
then the mind is mind.

673
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The mind is mind.

674
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And,

675
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
but,

676
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,000
again,

677
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
with the property

678
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
instruction,

679
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
in terms of the,

680
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
the dominant practice,

681
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and you could start discerning,

682
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
even that mind,

683
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
as a phenomenon.

684
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
No matter how quick it is,

685
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
generally,

686
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
it stays the phenomenon

687
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
of the mind.

688
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So you don't,

689
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
you're not swayed,

690
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
but with particular movements

691
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
of the general mind,

692
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
general moves,

693
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
because they will always

694
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
remain general.

695
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And then eventually,

696
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
you can,

697
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
but I don't even

698
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
passion,

699
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
enchantment of whatever

700
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
else with that,

701
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
as well.

702
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Because,

703
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
another thing,

704
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that's an icing season,

705
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
because this thing will

706
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
change you.

707
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You're a man for this.

708
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What is it, boy?

709
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Huh?

710
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No.

711
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Sit.

712
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Good.

713
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Good.

714
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Good.

715
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It always.

716
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Uh-huh.

717
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But it always follows this,

718
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
okay.

719
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
See if your mind

720
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
has,

721
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
what kind of state

722
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
you're minding?

723
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Is it default or not?

724
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
If it is,

725
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
bending,

726
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
that default,

727
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that default mind.

728
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Well,

729
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Well, even if it isn't abandoned, even if it's not a defilement, even if it's happiness in good mood, don't take it to be yours.

730
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So basically, seeing the mind regardless of what then mind is, whether it's defiled or not defiled, sure, don't entertain the defilements further when they are present in the general mind, by all means.

731
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If it's happiness, well, again, be wary of that. You know, there's that, that's what I think.

732
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I think Saliputo, and there was Saliputo said, once you regard pleasure as a, like a painful arrow, dangerous arrow, and then pain has like a deadly.

733
00:23:43,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure. Pleasure is a dark pain is a dead arrow, something an arrow. So sure, pleasure is not harmful not an awesome, but it's dangerous if you don't see a mind in regard to it, which means, then when another mind comes, you won't see that either.

734
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So you can't like, oh, well, you know, I look at, it's not the bothers me, but I'm not going to look at stuff because it shows the same nature. So you can abandon my bothers you, only by abandoning the nature of the entire thing, and that thing also includes the nature of happy mind, or related mind, or good mind.

735
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You know, you're not going to be taken, you're not going to get elated by it.

736
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Exactly, so relation is there, great, I don't have to do anything about it, but I certainly can also not get involved with it, not get taken by it.

737
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So to, when he knows his mind is unstained and defiled, then joy arises.

738
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah, that's different. Yeah, that's like a type of joy that arises when, not like the joy that comes as a kind of cloud of your mind.

739
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No, there's a state of your mind, but the joy that arises in regard to knowing your mind. In the same sense, again, inside the Buddha said, there is a pleasure arising in regard to not feeling any pleasure or pain for another hand, and that's very pleasant.

740
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yes, the thing is the joy of the mind is undefiled.

741
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah, sure, you should cultivate joy of knowing your mind, which is a joy that doesn't depend on the state of your mind, doesn't depend on your mind full stop.

742
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah, that's what it's, that's what it's so like.

743
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, I want to joy, I want to defile it, to be replaced by the joy of it.

744
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You can replace it with joy. You can replace both the fun and enjoy joyful mind. You replace that.

745
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Or rather, by abandoning that, you experience joy that doesn't depend neither on the fun, nor on your mind, nor on anything basically that's impermanent, which is why that pleasure is not unwholesome.

746
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And that's like the pleasure of the Janus, similar. It's because it's not unwholesome fun, you have to worry about it, you can even cultivate it.

747
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And it's not unwholesome because it's not underlined by the like late tendencies, though it's craving, though it's this, though.

748
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So it's a different, it's not a joy that it's not happiness that has a reason on a kind of happy mind, because the mind is elated.

749
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's not the happiness that has a reason, no. It's a happiness that has a reason in regard to knowing what mind, to recognizing the mind, to seeing the phenomenon of that mind, to not being moved but to being stronger than that mind.

750
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So the big, heavy cloud of that mind be good or bad, wants to take you, wants to pressure you, wants to make you go certain way, and you will for as long as that cloud's stronger than you.

751
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But when you become stronger, and then it's like the simulator, teraterigator, you know, it means like a mountain, and no matter what clouds and storms can't, it just does not move, impossible.

752
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That doesn't mean there are no storms and clouds coming, on the contrary, means it just does move.

753
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And there's another sort of, what I said, for other hand, is not overwhelmed by his mind, he is the one who overwhelms his mind.

754
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And so, you develop in regard to, and you can only start developing in regard to your mind, where you grasp the sign of that mind.

755
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, this is what the mind is. That's the naming of the mind, and then you start developing in regard to that.

756
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So it's not about the requirements, never arising in game, but it's the assumption that the requirements of mind, or the mind is mind.

757
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yes, the requirements are the requirements only when they're affecting you, only when you're taking by them, when you took them.

758
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But there will still be the requirements.

759
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Things that defile will still arise, but they will not defile you. That's a different thing.

760
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You still have mud and dirt, but now you're not getting dirty by it.

761
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Before, you would, whenever there's mud, you were muddy. Whenever there's dirt, you were dirty. But now you clean your mind, and you can't get dirty, so that again, similarly, like the Lotus on top of a horrible swam filthy pond.

762
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Not touched by it.

763
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But also, when the Buddha means mud, mud always comes around.

764
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, the mud still kept coming, but the Buddha was just like always seeing. He would always discern.

765
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Like, there wouldn't be even a remote possibility that he might not be able to see him. Why? Because he penetrated the whole nature, and that's what an argument is the same.

766
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
He understood the full nature and abandoned it, so no matter what arises, it can never defile him again.

767
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's there are no defilements. But yes, the stone clouds and stuff will keep arising.

768
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Because it was arising with some to begin with. It's nothing to do with you from the start.

769
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The Buddha said that, actually, when you got to Mahara, he said, well, the reason why Mahara can do with people where he wants, I pushed them in the directions and just make them engage in stuff, is because they take that which is his.

770
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Like, you go that in his domain, you yourself go in his domain, then you can't complain for him doing what he wants with you.

771
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Well, he said, and what is it that belongs to Mahara that people use? Like, I and Sites, ear and sounds, no, basically everything.

772
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Your whole sense is everything in and out belongs to Mahara.

773
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Where is the tension in the air? Hey!

774
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah, because there is this, does Angus advise him to put it in? No. Yeah, it's not his, but it's anger. Well, it wouldn't. Like, you can't use the same designation or the same term, anger. If you use it as anger for protrusion, I, a state that he's been defiled by, and it's resulting in anger, you can't use the same for the Buddha.

775
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So, you can say that things that would give rise to anger, still arise for the Buddha, but he's not angry. He doesn't give rise to actually anger.

776
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So, when they're about to try to kill him and stuff, everybody would, anybody would be angry, who would want to go to another, or be upset, or feel a little well, but he didn't.

777
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Nope, and it doesn't mean that he was oblivious to what David Arthur was doing. He was a foolish man. He's an idiot, basically. He's behavior is going to lead to, like, a long, long, lasting harm for him and so on.

778
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But he was an angry or a counter. He couldn't have been. So, those things that defile are still there, because that's Mahara's domain.

779
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And they will remain there, for as long as these senses are in this body, this fire is going to break apart, when you reach his body, and that's then it's done.

780
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So, that is the joy. He knows that he has abandoned the state of longing, and joy is there, and then a rapture, and then his body is calm, and his mind is concentrated.

781
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So, you didn't say he was, he said he's rapturous. You always get the same luck as he later, and you're getting all this excitement.

782
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah, I think it's a translation.

783
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think it's sugar.

784
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Which was a translation with rapture, but I think rapture comes from a Christian concept, rapture.

785
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Like, when you're divine, you know, touch it or whatever, and then you have that bodily elation of rapture.

786
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But it's not.

787
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, you can see through, like, well, you can get a glimpse of it through discerning the sign of humanity.

788
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You can see that it leads to that kind of immobility, equanimity, like, indifference.

789
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Now, the difference tells you of cruel or oblivious or blind. It just means nothing can move you.

790
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And then that, so, again, you can also see through that, that through discernment of the phenomenon of your mind,

791
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
then you start feeling content, and joy, that you are the one overwhelming your mind, not your mind,

792
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
you're wondering, what are your eyes?

793
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No matter how high you are, there's a chopping up your limbs, and brutalizing you in every possible way.

794
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You still overwhelm that mind, that mind doesn't overwhelm you.

795
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And that's some, some, like, extreme development, strength, and joy, and a bubble.

796
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You would, you would, like, well, you would know that.

797
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And you can see that it leads up to when it comes to, like, through knowing your mind,

798
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
you experience that joy, and then that results automatically in a concentration.

799
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So you don't get concentration through watching your nostrils or something,

800
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and you kind of develop this concentration, and kind of all, no, you get concentration through discernment of right things.

801
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So by all means, yeah, meditate, and then sit, cross-negative, whatever, to discern what your mind, the sign of your mind,

802
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the clouds of your mind, the movement, whatever, see this phenomenon, and then fortify yourself in regard to it,

803
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and you'll be concentrated automatically, whether you're going to vid it, where you're going to town,

804
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
when you sit alone, when you live on top of the hill, your mind is established.

805
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You know, to step one, abandon, defendants, and okay, now I've done that.

806
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Now come for the next session, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth.

807
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, it's wishful thinking, if it would only be like that, just here is a set, set a prescribed set of motions, and little methods you do, and you get there.

808
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The only set, the only, the only method is, develop understanding of the wrong things.

809
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And when you do it, it will result in that.

810
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Because abandoning the mind, state of mind, I can say I want to abandon the farmans, but then I won't.

811
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I want to hold on to the joy, to the happiness.

812
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, and that's often why people experience fear, because you think, oh, well if I, like sure, I want abandoning pain,

813
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
but that means I have to give up all these joys and pleasures of the life forever, and the Buddhism.

814
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But it's true, that's what you do.

815
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's true.

816
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You have to abandon it, and it's you, yeah.

817
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You have to abandon the whole thing, but it doesn't mean that you become joyless, or that means you discover a different type of happiness.

818
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And that's again what the Buddha said, replace the household happiness.

819
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I, the happiness of sensuality, the happiness of a lay life, replace that with happiness of renunciation.

820
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And see with the pain, replace the pains, the bothers, the troubles of a lay life with pains of renunciation, of an ascetic life.

821
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's much more wholesome, it's much more pleasant.

822
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And you know, you can stop and think about it. You know, after being among for a number of years, living relatively secluded, and so on.

823
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, you know, they're obviously hardships of physical kind, and also to things.

824
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
They enjoy it, whatever.

825
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But nothing is there, is actually comparable to stuff you had to deal with as a lay person, when you were still in the world with your job and stress, and just in the swamp.

826
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The swamp, of emotional issues, and duties, and burdens.

827
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And that just accumulates.

828
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So whether you're 15, 20, 30 years old, they would just keep growing, but it's there.

829
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And that's why you have the burden. You will only lay down in the burden.

830
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You lay down in the burden, but obviously that burden extends to all the previous lives, and all the ones that install for you if you don't get out.

831
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But it is, and you realize, oh, it's actually, yeah.

832
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Like, I can't tell you how it's much more pleasant here, living with wild tigers and stuff.

833
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Well, you might die next moment, but it's just clean. Emotionally clean.

834
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's not burdening you. It's free. It's freedom, in that sense.

835
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
But that takes time to develop.

836
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The mind is used to the swamp of centrality, distractions, and so on. This seems like death.

837
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And that's why people will freak out when they will hear the good news.

838
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But if you were to develop a fortify your mind and become accustomed to it, then you start seeing bad news.

839
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And I was like, oh, no, this is a freedom. But yeah, freedom, for those who are unaware, it's basically death.

840
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
They will be able to hold it.

841
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, because it's nothing else. You only used to be involved with things.

842
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah. Well, yeah, you become essentially dependent upon involvement.

843
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So there is nothing. You just, like, boredom sets in, and then boredom gets replaced by the exact in red.

844
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So quickly finally something that will keep my mind away from me, from my own state.

845
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Because I'll sink in.

846
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But if you know the correct path, and even then boredom.

847
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What the reason for boredom?

848
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You go through it and it doesn't rise anyway.

849
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because boredom only rises in regard to, like, a custom levels of distraction.

850
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And then when they are absent, then you feel bored.

851
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I, as a kind of like a gentle unpleasant sort of push towards compagnen.

852
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And boredom is that neutral feeling, which is, when unknown, it's unpleasant.

853
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Actually, now there's nothing. There's nothing exciting.

854
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
No, not exciting. It's even.

855
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But because you go used to only the excitement that even is unpleasant now.

856
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And you go back to the excitement.

857
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
All the depression.

858
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
All the depression for that matter.

859
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The depression is only the depression in regard to things that you are depressed.

860
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And that's again, like, when you do know that unpleasant, that neutral feeling,

861
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
boredom or depression, when you know it, it's not the present anymore.

862
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
When you discern it.

863
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It's quite peaceful.

864
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But it takes time to develop, to discern that criteria of what peace is.

865
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah, not scared of it, I don't think it's.

866
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, exactly. It gets scared of it.

867
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Because you became so dependent on the constant movement, constant action, constant something.

868
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Good or bad, just as long as something is happening.

869
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Because otherwise, I'll just drown.

870
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And that's pretty much everyone's life on there.

871
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Because if you think you're in control, well, okay, just decide to stop.

872
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Just decide to stop engaging.

873
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Stop giving into destruction.

874
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And then you'll see what's going to arise.

875
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And for how long you'll be able to hold it, to hold you determination.

876
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And the thing is, it's not really optional to do this.

877
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You might think how well you know.

878
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It will end in death and destruction and terror and dread.

879
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Start your fear throughout your life.

880
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That direction of that fear, that's what death is.

881
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So sooner or later, you will be taken there.

882
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So you might want to prepare yourself, or even if you're able to go through it beforehand.

883
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So when it arises, it doesn't concern you anymore.

884
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It doesn't pertain to your being anymore.

885
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Why? Because you extinguish it.

886
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Come, done.

887
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I just just called die before you die.

888
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Literally.

889
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Remove the life, remove power, the being.

890
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
From ever before, it's forcefully taken away.

891
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Because that means you keep coming back.

892
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You're dead.

893
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That's a beautiful place.

894
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah. Well, exactly.

895
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah, death becomes another preparation.

896
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And you haven't been, you haven't been,

897
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
when you haven't let go of the appropriation of the fire aggregates fundamentally.

898
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So you will have to endure their destruction and reappearing and destruction.

899
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And reappearing and destruction.

900
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Because that's what they do.

901
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Nothing obliges you to stay with them.

902
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
In the same sense, nothing obliges you to stay with the clouds of the mind when they arise.

903
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But you do, because you don't know any better.

904
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But when you do know something, like when you don't know better,

905
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and you develop better, better than you are.

906
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Then the development,

907
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and developing your mind,

908
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
developing states of mind.

909
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
What about that?

910
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Well, again, you can use the same designation, but it means a different thing.

911
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If you want to say accurate, but you're developing in regard to your mind,

912
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
which is a development of the mind.

913
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Because even if you yourself are not revolving around a general peripheral cloud of ill will,

914
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
that has a reason, let's say,

915
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you'll stop entertaining, and in particular notions of ill will,

916
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
through not engaging in those particular notions of ill will,

917
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
you wouldn't be fueling that cloud back.

918
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So it will arise, but it will arise less and less.

919
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And then certain things that might defile might arise, but they will not defile.

920
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And to know that you cannot be defiled,

921
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
they cannot possibly linger in any sense of defilement.

922
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And I was like,

923
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I think, was it an underworld,

924
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
a Buddha or somebody else,

925
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
was an underworld?

926
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
No, he was an underworld Buddha.

927
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Or maybe not.

928
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Doesn't matter.

929
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Point is, somebody else, I think, was an underworld,

930
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and they said,

931
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
oh, I don't.

932
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You see, always feels the pleasure of his enlightenment all the time.

933
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And then, and then Buddha said,

934
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
no, no.

935
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Like, in the beginning when somebody develops to the point of our attitude,

936
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
yeah, there would be that novelty of that time of release.

937
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But after all, they didn't use it.

938
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And then, they would feel pleasure, same pleasure of our energy,

939
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
only in certain instances,

940
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
when they would end up in circumstances or something

941
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that would, like in the past,

942
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
give rise to the defilements of anger,

943
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
or sensuality, or something.

944
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But now, you wouldn't.

945
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So, like, they would recognize the same set of everything identical,

946
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
but no response internally.

947
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It's just fully extinguished internally.

948
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It cannot even be conceived to kind of reappear again,

949
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
and then they feel pleasure again.

950
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Ah, I am indeed free.

951
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Not that they need a reminder,

952
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
but when it happens, they'll feel that joy for, like,

953
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
oh, yeah, I remember when this used to pull me left and right,

954
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and control me for, you know, days and end.

955
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And then, just walk off, continue.

956
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And so, the problem behind us,

957
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:22,000
is the kindness, it's not the kindness as a different kind of kindness.

958
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's a different kind of...

959
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Well, see, once again, once you grasp the sign of your mind,

960
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
then you can start attending to what that sign is in different ways.

961
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But you can't start practicing browning hours of,

962
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
or any other, establishment of mind properly.

963
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
If you don't have the sign of your mind.

964
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But once you, like, fully established in the,

965
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
in the recognize in the phenomena of your mind,

966
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
you're not even mistaking it anymore.

967
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You see it.

968
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Then, yeah, then, okay, why don't you gladden that mind?

969
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
That phenomenon is right in front of you.

970
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Just relax it.

971
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Gladden it.

972
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Why don't you regard it with loving kindness?

973
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Why don't you regard it?

974
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
With equality.

975
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Practice immobility in regard to that phenomenon of the mind.

976
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Regardless of what that mind is,

977
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
whether it's effective or sensuality or happiness or whatever,

978
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
you're not concerned anymore with your particular hindrance of that mind.

979
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You are just looking in the nature of the sign of that mind,

980
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
which is the development of mind.

981
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So, you are developing that mind or other in regard to that mind.

982
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Once you have kind of stepped away,

983
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
this through discernment of that sign of the mind

984
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and not being, not being, like, even the jannas

985
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
or whatever when you establish your mind first,

986
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
you basically depend on the five hindrances.

987
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You put them away.

988
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Through discernment, and then you get established in that,

989
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and then the joy arises from that seclusion and so on and so forth.

990
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Pramu, Vihara, is there any other type of establishment mind?

991
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It was the same, or rather, pertains to the same levels.

992
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So, your kind is a confused, putugina,

993
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
left and right.

994
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It doesn't even discern what a phenomenon of that peripheral mind is,

995
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
and then he practices in beings,

996
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
radiating, loving, kindness and stuff.

997
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Let's just wish for thinking.

998
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
They might make you feel better,

999
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
but it doesn't really make any fundamental difference.

1000
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Why? Because if you're doing loving kindness correctly,

1001
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
it should be resulting eventually in a pecan,

1002
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
in the quantity, in complete,

1003
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
or in immobility.

1004
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And you know, you visualizing, loving everyone and stuff,

1005
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and going to make a big difference there.

1006
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Why? Because you're not applying it to the right place.

1007
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So, it needs to be applied to that framework,

1008
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
as Nariya mentioned, to the framework of others.

1009
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And that's for the sign of the mind,

1010
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
the framework of one's other.

1011
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You are another to yourself, really.

1012
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You're just less external of that than the others.

1013
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But when you start seeing your mind,

1014
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
or other minds,

1015
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
a reason on their own,

1016
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
you realize this is like, yeah,

1017
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
there is an agreement externally,

1018
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
in that person,

1019
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
there is an agreement internally,

1020
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I, in this person,

1021
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
but not of it is mine.

1022
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So, yeah.

1023
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Then you apply loving kindness,

1024
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
if you can use the word apply.

1025
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Basically, you regard that phenomenon,

1026
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
that sign of that mind,

1027
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
with loving kindness.

1028
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You are taking control of that independent mind,

1029
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
then arises.

1030
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But you are taking control,

1031
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
like practicing certain attitudes in regard to it.

1032
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You are not taking control by kind of repossessing it,

1033
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
by taking, like, by reappropriating it,

1034
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
by making in mind, mind again.

1035
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
No. Yeah.

1036
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You fully get established in that attitude of this,

1037
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
not just that it ain't mine,

1038
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
but it cannot even be mine,

1039
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
because if it were mine,

1040
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it wouldn't have been a rising on its own.

1041
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But if it rises on its own,

1042
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
that's absolutely no more doubt

1043
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
that it cannot be mine.

1044
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That's basically the right view.

1045
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And when you have absolutely no doubt

1046
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
that it cannot even be yours,

1047
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
even if you want to,

1048
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and you can't even want to,

1049
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
because that would be a form

1050
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
of taking it out of the yours.

1051
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
When you establish it, then yeah.

1052
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Regarding loving kindness,

1053
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
or gliding it,

1054
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
or release it,

1055
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
or do this,

1056
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
or do that.

1057
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But that's like the,

1058
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
there would be the practice of samadhi.

1059
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Establishing your mind in such a way,

1060
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
once you've seen it correctly,

1061
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and once you've got it all ready.

1062
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yeah, that also seems,

1063
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you know, secondary priorities.

1064
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Well, it's become natural.

1065
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yeah, it will come.

1066
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Like, the concentration will come as a result of that joy.

1067
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
They will come as a result of recognizing the mind

1068
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
for what it is,

1069
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and feeling, well,

1070
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
sheltered, feeling safe from it,

1071
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
feeling not burdened by it anymore.

1072
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Can you feel joyful?

1073
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Can you feel joyful?

1074
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You feel calm.

1075
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You feel calm.

1076
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You feel concentrated.

1077
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And that's what concentration is.

1078
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah, it's awesome.

1079
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Everything just,

1080
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
we say that,

1081
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
it follows from that,

1082
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
or goes from that.

1083
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah.

1084
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Equanimity.

1085
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's what it needs to be,

1086
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
it needs to be rooted

1087
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
in the right view,

1088
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
in the right discernment.

1089
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Why? Because it's a protuginal,

1090
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and the person here is a concentration.

1091
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
They have a protuginal's idea of concentration.

1092
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Which means,

1093
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
if they then engage in a method

1094
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and a practice,

1095
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
they'll be revolving around their protuginal's idea of concentration.

1096
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Which means,

1097
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
there will not be the right concentration.

1098
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And samadhi is such that,

1099
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
imaginary color,

1100
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
like every,

1101
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
every aspect of the normal day of the party,

1102
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
comes with a right view first.

1103
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The right view makes it all right.

1104
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And it's like so self-explanatory,

1105
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
that it's actually very hard to see.

1106
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah.

1107
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And obviously,

1108
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
because it's not,

1109
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
there is not like middle ground.

1110
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh yes,

1111
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I don't see,

1112
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
but I can still do it right now.

1113
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You can't.

1114
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That's a contradiction in terms.

1115
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I'll do everything else.

1116
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I'll learn what it for a practice.

1117
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah.

1118
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, I'm not,

1119
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
like I'm not at the right view,

1120
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
but I still know how to meditate.

1121
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That doesn't make sense.

1122
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yeah.

1123
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
That's rather nonsense.

1124
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Same there.

1125
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Or I'm like,

1126
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
sure,

1127
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
if knowing how to meditate means doing

1128
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
one or what,

1129
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
one on the way,

1130
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
but not the,

1131
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
not the meditation,

1132
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
the Buddha within courage.

1133
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So it needs to come with a right view.

1134
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And when there is a right view,

1135
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
it will come out of the right view.

1136
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So as you said yourself,

1137
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
oh,

1138
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
discerning the sign of the mind,

1139
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
all the films come,

1140
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
all the films come,

1141
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
feeling calm,

1142
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
joy is our, joy arises,

1143
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
feeling joy,

1144
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
concentration is established.

1145
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Concentration is established,

1146
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
we can continue from other cities,

1147
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
seeing clearly even more,

1148
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
gets fully developed,

1149
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
like seeing things clearly

1150
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
to the full extent means,

1151
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
means complete destruction

1152
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
of the fetters,

1153
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
clearly insight in wisdom,

1154
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
pinealiberate,

1155
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
that's it,

1156
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
done.

1157
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's not just, you know,

1158
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
just don't bother with trying to understand,

1159
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
just stick to a prescribed method,

1160
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
of like physical notions

1161
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and observations,

1162
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
or the nostrils,

1163
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
and stuff,

1164
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
because it makes you feel better

1165
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
in your pathogen world.

1166
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And then just keep going back to it whenever you need it.

1167
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Even while staying pathogen.

1168
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah,

1169
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
even while it's speech.

1170
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Look,

1171
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
there is nothing right

1172
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
in the state of pathogen,

1173
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
which is why it's a state of pathogen.

1174
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Now, even a bit,

1175
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
it might be nice speech.

1176
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It might be lovely speech,

1177
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
but it's not necessarily right.

1178
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So that's why the

1179
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
sole concern of somebody,

1180
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
who is still a pathogen,

1181
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
needs to be developing the right view,

1182
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
because then they will make everything as right.

1183
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So I developed a view through this sermon,

1184
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
through this sermon,

1185
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
through this sermon,

1186
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
where you're not well,

1187
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
through this sermon,

1188
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
you can discern things

1189
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
by knowing what you're supposed to discern.

1190
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And you can know what you're supposed to discern

1191
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
by investigating what the options are

1192
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
with this sermon,

1193
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
so to speak.

1194
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That's like what we spoke

1195
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
in the other talk,

1196
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
when I was a yesterday or day before.

1197
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Like measuring the task,

1198
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
and so on.

1199
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But as you can see,

1200
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
like what we spoke about now,

1201
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
in terms of the

1202
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
chip,

1203
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
the limit and the phenomenon of the mind,

1204
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
and like a general cloud,

1205
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
the mood and so on,

1206
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
it's not,

1207
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
well, it's not abstract,

1208
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
because that

1209
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
that chip that is both

1210
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
your feelings and your perception,

1211
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
which is what the term is the mind.

1212
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So you feel,

1213
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
like that mood,

1214
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
you might be able to even describe it

1215
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
in certain terms of perception,

1216
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
but you also feel it simultaneously.

1217
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Like that pressure of the mood,

1218
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
you can all

1219
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
any mood,

1220
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
like even if you can't quite define what it is,

1221
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
one thing you know for sure is,

1222
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
whether it's pleasant or unpleasant,

1223
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
fundamentally,

1224
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
whether it's kind of okay,

1225
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
or kind of not okay,

1226
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
or kind of,

1227
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
nah, nah, nah.

1228
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So you start feeling it properly

1229
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
through this sermon in your mind,

1230
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
which is why,

1231
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
for this sermon in the mind,

1232
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
results in complete destruction

1233
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
of your feelings,

1234
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
of suffering and so on.

1235
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's not,

1236
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
oh, I need to discern it,

1237
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
abstractly together,

1238
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
get my head around it,

1239
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
and then,

1240
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I'll apply it.

1241
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Now, getting your head around it,

1242
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
right leg means applying it, right leg.

1243
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
That's how you can have, like,

1244
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
one liberated through wisdom,

1245
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
through, like,

1246
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
just through the sermon,

1247
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
so powerful,

1248
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
the results in complete destruction of fetus.

1249
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Here we go.

1250
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You have a mind of your will,

1251
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
then, which is unpleasant,

1252
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
it is unpleasant.

1253
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But then,

1254
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
you think by,

1255
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
you want to get away from that,

1256
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
unpleasant or pain,

1257
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and then you want to get to the pleasure,

1258
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
so you give in.

1259
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Yeah,

1260
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and that gives you pleasure,

1261
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
the mask,

1262
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
that's fundamental pain.

1263
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Same essentiality.

1264
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Fundamentally,

1265
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
sensuality is unpleasant.

1266
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Remember, I was speaking about this before,

1267
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
like, for some point,

1268
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
it was engaged in centrality.

1269
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Essential desire arises.

1270
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You just give in.

1271
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
You just go for it for satisfaction,

1272
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and it just feels,

1273
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
the whole thing just feels pleasant.

1274
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Then, you'll find a reason

1275
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
to practice restraint,

1276
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
all restraints forced upon you.

1277
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Like, you can't have your desires fulfilled.

1278
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And then, you experience this tremendous pain,

1279
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
like a dart,

1280
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
as the sutras refer.

1281
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Pacing pain of,

1282
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
and you think,

1283
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
initially, without any wisdom,

1284
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
youth, everybody would think,

1285
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
that that pain is a result of me saying no,

1286
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
to my desires.

1287
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But if you stick to it long enough,

1288
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
you start discerning that actually no.

1289
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
My restraint, my saying no,

1290
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
only made me neutral

1291
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
in regard to the reason thing,

1292
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and what was revealed then was pain.

1293
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And that's why,

1294
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
we give in to the central design,

1295
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
because it's so painful, not to.

1296
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
When you mind is taken by centrality,

1297
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
it's very painful to not give in.

1298
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So you don't even consider it,

1299
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
on top of that,

1300
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
giving in then,

1301
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
not just the mask that initial appears

1302
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
of the centrality of, like, pain,

1303
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
it doesn't just mask that,

1304
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
but then it coats it

1305
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
with pleasure on top of it,

1306
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
like satisfaction of age,

1307
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
enjoyment of the senses.

1308
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So you kind of have not just avoiding pain,

1309
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
but getting pleasure

1310
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
out of avoiding pain.

1311
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It's like a double wedding.

1312
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And that's why it's so hard to break away from it.

1313
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And that's why,

1314
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
like, the minds are so

1315
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
bogged down in it,

1316
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
that even if you were to start practicing your restraint,

1317
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
that whole pain in their eyes

1318
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
is you wouldn't be attributing it to centrality,

1319
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
because you're so deluded.

1320
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You'd be thinking, no, this is coming from me,

1321
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
so you know.

1322
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But basically, you saying yes or no

1323
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
should not make an emotional difference

1324
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
to anything you were about to do

1325
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
or you were doing.

1326
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
If it is making difference, means that thing

1327
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
is emotionally evolving.

1328
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And if it's emotionally evolving, means it's not awesome.

1329
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So basically, whatever you were about to do,

1330
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
just say no to yourself

1331
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and see if any emotions are going to rise,

1332
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
if they do, means you're involved there

1333
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and your restraint, you're saying no

1334
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
is just revealing you that.

1335
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's not adding anything to it.

1336
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
No taking away anything from it.

1337
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So that's why, like, that pain of restraint,

1338
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
is not actually pain of restraint.

1339
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It's pain of centrality that's revealed

1340
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
through restraint.

1341
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And you see that

1342
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
sufficiently enough,

1343
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
some people sooner or some people later,

1344
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
you would not...

1345
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Like, your mind wouldn't go

1346
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
but wouldn't go to the centrality once or ever.

1347
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It could really relish and enjoy the restraint.

1348
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Because restraint is freedom from it.

1349
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Mm-hmm.

1350
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah, and resulting.

1351
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Well, yeah, concentrate.

1352
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And what, resulting in escape

1353
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
from the whole...

1354
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
By not, by...

1355
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Sorry, by by...

1356
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
By attributing the pain to restraint,

1357
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
you're always going to have like a romantic

1358
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
pleasurable, delightful notions of centrality.

1359
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And now you're just grinding against

1360
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
through whatever sets of, like, morals

1361
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and virtues that you adopted externally

1362
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
but not really knowing why.

1363
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Because it always feels...

1364
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And that's what we said.

1365
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
He doesn't welcome, he doesn't delight

1366
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
the centrality.

1367
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Okay, you have to start practicing those attitudes.

1368
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You don't welcome it, you don't delight in it.

1369
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Because even if you practice the restraint,

1370
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
if you never ever engage

1371
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
in any bodily act of centrality through any sense,

1372
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
you still can entertain it in your mind

1373
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
for the rest of your life.

1374
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But if you abandon it in the mind,

1375
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
then automatically you won't be able to engage

1376
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
in it by body.

1377
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And there's another similar in the suitors

1378
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
with, like, having a trying to light a fire

1379
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
with two fire sticks, they were in water.

1380
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Like, okay, sure, you take them out of the water first.

1381
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
You can't light them while they're still in the river.

1382
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But unless they dry outside of the water,

1383
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
you still wouldn't be able to light a fire.

1384
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Okay, I'm out of the water, but they're still wet.

1385
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So, like, one's mind still remains wet,

1386
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
even when the body is withdrawn from centrality.

1387
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
The mind still remains wet in regard to it.

1388
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And the mind remains wet

1389
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
for as long as you're misplacing where the real pain comes from.

1390
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
By misplacing the real pain,

1391
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
you look for the pleasure in the wrong place.

1392
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Like, consequently.

1393
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It gets very confusing if you're trying to,

1394
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
you know, attack the mind,

1395
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
clear it out with adding this and adding that

1396
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and fight it with kindness.

1397
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Destroy you.

1398
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Well, you're just, just throwing more confusion

1399
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
onto the already existing pile of confusion.

1400
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Because you've got to make this

1401
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and make sure, what's happening now?

1402
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah, what was it?

1403
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Discounting and tasting.

1404
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
No, it's this side, just that.

1405
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But it all leaves you out.

1406
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Just you doing this and you're going to that.

1407
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
The dresses you know,

1408
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
the very criteria of what made you choose

1409
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
to decide to do this against that in the first place.

1410
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Because that's already affected by ignorance.

1411
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yet, you took it for granted,

1412
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
that your power of decision is already right

1413
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and knows the way it out.

1414
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
So I'll just do this when I do that.

1415
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
This makes sense.

1416
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Again, if somebody's honest that they know that,

1417
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
okay, I don't have a right view.

1418
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Thus, even what makes sense to me is not right.

1419
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's necessarily, I do not know.

1420
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So then you really have to stop.

1421
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Well, certainly,

1422
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
you certainly have to stop

1423
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
using the criteria of what feels right

1424
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
and what feels good.

1425
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Because it basically is because of the feelings

1426
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
that you are not analyzing.

1427
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So using that as a criteria

1428
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
to the enlightenment is a contradiction in terms.

1429
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
So you need to use discernment.

1430
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Literally, start developing the discernment.

1431
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
What makes sense?

1432
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Use your reason.

1433
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Use develop wisdom understanding.

1434
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And in big, by big, on top of that,

1435
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
you end up with more.

1436
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You build more, and it will progress.

1437
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
They will then result

1438
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
in discernment of the fundamental things,

1439
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
such as your feelings,

1440
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
your intentions, and so on, and they'll feel from it.

1441
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I mean, all the way I've talked about it,

1442
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
really, when mental is understanding,

1443
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
developing understanding.

1444
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Same thing is clearly.

1445
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
He knows he sees.

1446
01:01:40,000 --> 01:02:06,000
He knows that he knows he sees and he sees.
