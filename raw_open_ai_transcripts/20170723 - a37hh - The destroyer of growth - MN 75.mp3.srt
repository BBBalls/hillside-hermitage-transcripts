1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So this is the Majuminikaya 75 to Magandia.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thus have I heard.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,800
I want to occasion the blessed one was living in Prudu country where there was a town of

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Prudu's name, Kamasama, Kamasama. On a spread of grass in the fire chamber of a

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,700
Brahmin belonging to the Buddha Vajra clan, then when it was morning, the blessed one dressed

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,360
and taking his bow and outer road went into Kamasadama for alms. He had wandered for alms

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,640
in Kamasadama and had returned from his alms. After his meal, he went to a certain

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,360
road for the days of biding. Having entered the grove, he sat down at the root of the tree

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:09,880
for the days of biding. Then the wanderer, Magandia, while walking and wandering for exercise,

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:21,200
went to the fire chamber of the Brahmin belonging to the Buddha Vajra clan.

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
There he saw a spread of grass prepared and asked the Brahmin, for whom has this spread

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,780
of grass being prepared in the master Bhada Vajra's fire chamber. It seems like it might

13
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,200
be a recruse's bed.

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Master Magandia, there is a recruse Goetama, the son of the Suckian, who went forth from

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,800
the Suckian clan. Now a good report of the master Goetama has been spread to this effect.

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Blessed one is accomplished fully enlightened, perfect and true knowledge and conduct, supplying

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,680
nowhere of world's incomparable leader of persons to be attained. Teacher of gods and

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:06,120
rumours, enlightened, blessed. This bed has been prepared for that master Goetama.

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,280
Indeed Master Bhada Vajra, it is an ill sight we see when we see the bed of that destroyer

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,760
of growth, Master Goetama. Be careful what you say, Magandia. Be careful what you say.

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,040
Many learned nobles, learned Brahmins, learned householders and learned recruses at full

22
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,160
confidence in Master Goetama and have been disciplined by him in a noble true way in

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,160
the Dhamma that is also.

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,840
Master Bhada Vajra, even if we saw that Master Goetama face to face, we would tell him

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,360
to his face. The recruse Goetama is a destroyer of growth. Why is that? Because that has come

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,840
down in our discourse. If Master Magandia has no objection, may I tell this to Master

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,640
Goetama. Let Master Bhada Vajra be at ease, tell him just what I have said. Meanwhile

28
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,920
with the divine ear which is purified and surpasses the human, the blessed one heard this

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,800
conversation between the Brahmin Bhada Vajra and the wanderer, Magandia. Then when it was

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,440
evening, the blessed one rose from meditation, went to the Brahmin's fire chamber and sat

31
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,840
down on the spread of grass made ready. Then the Brahmin Bhada Vajra went to the best one

32
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,640
and exchanged greetings within. When this courtesan amiable talk was finished, he sat down

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,720
on one side. The blessed one asked him, Bhada Vajra, did you have any conversation with

34
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,600
the wanderer, Magandia, about this very same spread of grass? When this was said, the Brahmin

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,200
all struck with his hair standing on end, replied, we wanted to tell Master Goetama about

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,440
that very thing, that Master Goetama has not anticipated us. But this discussion between

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,360
the blessed one and the Brahmin was left unfinished, for then the wanderer, Magandia, while

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,160
walking and wandering for exercise, came to the Brahmin's fire chamber and went up to

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,960
the blessed one. Each train's greetings with the blessed one, and when this courtesan amiable

40
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:21,160
talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The blessed one said to him, Magandia, the

41
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,960
eye delights in forms, takes the light in forms, rejoices in forms, that has been

42
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,120
maintained by the litigator, guarded, protected and restrained. Any teacher stood down

43
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,480
more for its restraints. Was it with reference to this that he said, the records go to

44
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,040
them as a destroyer of growth? It was reference to this Master Goetama that I said, the records

45
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,960
go to them as a destroyer of growth. Why is that? Because that is recorded in our

46
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,360
classroom. The ear delights in sounds, the nose delights in odours, the tongue delights

47
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,960
in flavours, the body delights in tangilies, the mind delights in mind objects, takes the

48
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,360
light in mind objects, rejoices in mind objects, that has been claimed by the litigator, guarded,

49
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,360
protected and restrained. Any teacher stood down more for its restraints. Was it with reference

50
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,960
to this that he said, the records go to them as a destroyer of growth? It was with reference

51
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,520
to this Master Goetama that I said, the records go to them as a destroyer of growth. Why

52
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:40,080
is that? Because that is recorded in our scriptures. What do you think, Magandia? Here, someone

53
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:48,000
may have formerly enjoyed himself with forms cognizable by the eye. That I wished for, desired,

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,280
agreeable and likable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. On a later

55
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,120
occasion having understood as they actually are the origin, the disappearance and the gratification,

56
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,360
the danger and the escape in the case of forms. He might abandon the craving for forms,

57
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,360
remove fever for forms and abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peace. What would

58
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,040
you say to him, Magandia? Nothing, Master Goetama. And light lies with sounds cognizable

59
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,480
by the ear, odours cognizable by the nose, flavours cognizable by the tongue and pendules

60
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:38,240
cognizable by the body. Magandia formerly, when I lived a home life, I enjoyed myself,

61
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,040
provided and endowed with five chords of sensual pleasure. The forms cognizable by the eye

62
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,720
and sounds cognizable by the ear, odours cognizable by the nose, flavours cognizable by the tongue,

63
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,920
the tangibles cognizable by the body that I wished for, desired, agreeable and likable,

64
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,960
connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. I had three palaces, one for the rainy

65
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,800
season, one for the winter and one for the summer. I lived in the rain's palace for the

66
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,680
four months of the rainy season, enjoying myself with musicians, none of whom were men,

67
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,360
and I did not go down to the lower palace. On a later occasion, having understood this,

68
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,680
they actually are the origin of the disappearance, the gratification, the danger and escape. In

69
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,600
the case of sensual pleasures, I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures. I removed fever

70
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,440
for sensual pleasures, and I abide without thirst for the mind inwardly of peace. I see

71
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,400
other beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, beings vowed by craving for

72
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,080
sensual pleasures, burning with the fever for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual

73
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,160
pleasures, and I do not envy them nor do I delight them in. Why is that? Because there

74
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,200
is Magandia a delight apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unhulsing states, which surpasses

75
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:14,480
even divine bliss. Since I take delight in that, I do not envy what is interior nor do

76
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:28,760
I delight them in. Suppose Magandia a householder, or a householder's son was rich with great

77
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,200
wealth and property, and being provided in endowed with the five chords of sensual pleasure,

78
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,200
he might enjoy himself with forms cognizable by the eye, with sounds cognizable by the ear

79
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,800
of odours cognizable by the nose, with flavours cognizable by the tongue, with tangibles cognizable

80
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,760
by the body that I wished for desire, agreeable and viable, connected with sensual desire and

81
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,280
provocative of lust. Having conducted himself well in body, speech and mind, on the dissolution

82
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,720
of the body, after death, he might reappear in a happy destination, in the heavenly world,

83
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,400
in the retinue of the guards of the thirty-two, and they are surrounded by the group of

84
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,720
nymphs in the nun, nun, nun, dhana, and grove, he would enjoy himself, provided in endowed

85
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,000
with the five chords of divine sensual pleasure. Suppose then he sought a householder, or

86
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,760
a householder's son, enjoying himself, provided and endowed with the five chords of human

87
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,400
sensual pleasure. What do you think Magandia, who did young guards surrounded by the group

88
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,640
of nymphs and nun, under grove, enjoying himself, provided in endowed with the five chords

89
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,760
of divine sensual pleasure, envied the householder for the five chords of human sensual pleasure.

90
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:56,160
Or would he be enticed by human sensual pleasures? No master go to them. Why not? Because divine

91
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,680
sensual pleasures are more accidents and sublime than human sensual pleasures.

92
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:19,040
Suppose Magandia, he was a leper, with swords and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by

93
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,280
worms, scratching off the scouts, with his nails caught rising his body over a burning

94
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,720
charcoal pit, then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physician

95
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,360
to treat him. The physician would take, would make medicine for him, and by means of

96
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,880
that medicine, the man would be cured of his leprosy, and would become well and happy,

97
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:50,280
independent, master himself, able to go where he wants, then he might see another leper

98
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:58,400
with swords and blisters, and scraping off the scouts with his nails, caught rising his

99
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,880
body over a burning charcoal pit. What do you think, Magandia, would that man envy that

100
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,520
leper for his burning charcoal pit, or his use of medicine? No master go to them. Why

101
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,160
is that? Because when there is sickness, there is need for medicine, and when there is

102
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:32,440
no sickness, there is no need for medicine. Suppose Magandia, there was a leper with swords

103
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,200
and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching off the scouts, or the openings

104
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,840
of his wounds for his nails, caught rising his body over a burning charcoal pit, then

105
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,840
his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, brought a physician to treat him.

106
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,080
The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine, that man would

107
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:59,280
be cured of his leprosy, and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself,

108
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,040
able to go where he likes. Then two strong men would seize him, both by art, with both

109
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,120
by art, seize him by both arms, and drag him towards a burning charcoal pit. What do

110
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,200
you think Magandia? Would that man twist his body this way and let? Yes, master go to

111
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:25,160
them. Why is that? Because that fire is indeed painful to touch, huts and scorching. What

112
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,440
do you think Magandia? Is it only now that the fire is painful to touch, huts and scorching,

113
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,480
or previously too, was that fire painful to touch, huts and scorching? Master go to them,

114
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,840
that fire is now painful to touch, huts and scorching, and previously too, that fire

115
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,800
was painful to touch, huts and scorching. For when that man was a leprosy, with swords

116
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,560
and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms scratching the scab of the openings

117
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,200
of his wounds, wounds with his nails, his faculties were impaired, thus though the fire

118
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:08,440
was actually painful to touch, he would acquire a mistaken perception of it as pleasant.

119
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,320
So too, Magandia, in the past, central pleasures were painful to touch, huts and scorching.

120
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,760
In the future, central pleasures will be painful to touch, huts and scorching, and now

121
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:29,000
at present, central pleasures are painful to touch, huts and scorching. But these beings

122
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,600
who are not free from lust for central pleasures, who are devoured by craving for central pleasures,

123
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,720
who burn with the fever for central pleasures, faculties that are impaired, thus those central

124
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,960
pleasures are actually painful to touch, they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasant.

125
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:55,560
Well, on that note, that's what I was saying yesterday in this program, when I was explaining

126
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:02,640
that when people initially start practicing the restraint, they might feel like pain,

127
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,040
pain in regard to sensuality, they see something with their eye, something pleasant, something

128
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:17,440
with their ear or with their tongue, and it could be assumed that that pain was because

129
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,840
of the restraint placed upon the senses. But actually, if one sticks to the restraint

130
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,280
and doesn't give in to the senses, it becomes apparent that that pain is the very nature

131
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:37,080
of the senses, of the central core, of the central desire. Which means that pain was always

132
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,600
there, it just was never felt because it was never existed, because one just went with

133
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:50,520
it, so in order to not feel the pain of that dark, you just quickly succumb, quickly say

134
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,840
yes, so it doesn't hurt you. And the similarly I gave yesterday, I think, we didn't

135
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:04,320
record it, but was like imagine you have a very, very strong dog on the leaf and something

136
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:12,560
comes in its eyesight and you see it's beginning to run for it. And you know the dog is powerful

137
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,680
and if you stay in the place where you were, it's just going to rip your arm and it's going

138
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,320
to be very unpleasant and very painful. So, you just start running with it. And then

139
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,480
obviously you develop also to use on a kind of enjoying the run or whatever else, when

140
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,320
in reality you really have no choice. But going with the senses, why? Because saying

141
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,320
no to it is just dreadful. You can terrify people and make them freak out. And that's

142
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,240
why sometimes when the circumstances place a restraint on you, so to speak, when you

143
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:52,600
can't get what you want, it drives people mad, that pain. So basically, even from the

144
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,880
day one, when somebody starts practicing the restraint, the pain of restraint, it's

145
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,440
not caused by the restraint, it's revealed by the restraint and that is the pain of

146
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,600
the senses and sensual pain. And that's exactly what I would have said. All of us even

147
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,040
when you were enjoying the senses in the past and all those people who will enjoy them

148
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:18,440
in the future, those sensual pleasures are actually painful, like that fire that was

149
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:26,120
always painful. So only the mind that is impaired in regard to that nature would blame the pain

150
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,600
to lack of satisfaction of your senses, not the lack of actually understanding of the

151
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,240
senses. So then when people feel pain on a ton of senses, they think it's because they

152
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,960
haven't indulged them enough, they blame the restraint. But it's completely the other

153
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,720
way around. It's the actual delight and lust, it's the dark that affects you, that it's

154
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,120
so unpleasant that you kind of automatically just go for it, go for the pleasure. And then

155
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,880
not just that you mask, cover up the dark, but then you also get the pleasure that kind

156
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,200
of contain in the senses. So then you feel like you win both ways. You feel like you avoid

157
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,080
the pain and you feel like you enjoy the pleasure on top of it. But the fact is that that

158
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,160
is not optional. I mean, fundamentally it is optional, but for most people, it isn't,

159
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,600
they're just too weak to say no to it. The fact that they're always driven by it means

160
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,120
basically they're always slaves to it and that is no pleasure at all.

161
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,000
But they don't see the actual fever, the burning. No, no. They blame the fever, the burning

162
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,520
to the lack of satisfaction. So then they just think I just have to go harder for it until

163
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,680
the fever, the burning disappears. But it doesn't disappear. You just cover it up. So

164
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,360
you pursue the desire more, it does not make the fever and burning disappear, it makes

165
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,680
it increase, it makes it burn even harder next time, which is going to make you run for

166
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,600
it even harder as a result. But the whole kind of, the only thing you're going to accomplish

167
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,800
is cover up, cover up of the same burning embers. You're about burning, yeah. Like the left

168
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:19,120
is, it just has to take the charcoal to the closer burning. So the pain of the sense

169
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,240
desire that's revealed by the restraint and just repeating that is belongs to the sense

170
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,440
desire, not the restraint. The restraint merely reveals it. Hence the restraint is the

171
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,560
necessary precondition for the rising of wisdom, for the rising of the understanding of

172
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,760
the nature of things.

173
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:49,280
But if you, if you're a stranger, you still have the, at all, the pain of the sense is

174
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,240
still there. But you're not going further and getting more feverish.

175
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,200
And the pain, the pain will be there for as long as it doesn't sink deep enough that

176
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,400
the pain does not belong to the restraint, it belongs to the senses. And for that very

177
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,320
reason, the restraint is actually quite pleasant. Fire will always be hot, even a hundred

178
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,320
miles away from you. But now that you're not pulled towards it and you know there is

179
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,480
no danger of you falling into that burning pit, you know it is. Why? Because of your

180
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:27,080
restraint, because you don't go anywhere near it. Hence the pleasure of renunciation always

181
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,440
shrunk the pleasure of, of sensuality.

182
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,160
Yeah, the pain, the pleasure of sensuality is always there, it's always there.

183
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:43,960
Exactly. But your mind will be, it will go everywhere else away from that sensual pleasure.

184
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Like that man was being dragged by the two stronger men to a pit, he would want to be

185
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,880
everywhere else but that pit. Because you recognize that the whole pain, the whole kind

186
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:02,760
of drama and proliferation and everything else and mess that comes with it, it's all on

187
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,040
account of the sensual pleasures. So all you have to do is say, note it and you're literally

188
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,920
free from that entire domain of misfortune. And there was another sort of it, but I did

189
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:24,920
say all the fathers fight with sons, sons fight with mothers, brothers with sisters, brothers

190
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,920
with brothers, kings with kings, nations, all on account of sensual pleasures, all on

191
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,520
account of sensuality. All of the wars that are being waged, that will be waged, it's all

192
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:42,520
on account of sensuality, nothing else. But it's all of that, it might not mean anything

193
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:51,320
if a person on that individual, private personal level still don't recognize the pain of sensuality

194
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:57,000
belonging to the actual sensuality. So the pain of saying no to sensuality belonging

195
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,520
to the actual sensuality, not to you saying no. Saying no merely reveals it.

196
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:13,040
So Sutta continues, suppose Magandha there was a leopard with swords and blisters on his

197
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,800
wings, being devoured by worms, stretching the scarves off the openings of his wounds for

198
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,440
his nails, quarterising his body over a burning charcoal pit. The more he stretches the scarves

199
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,440
and quarterises his body, the fowler, more evil smelling and more infected the wounds,

200
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,240
the openings of his wounds would become. Yet he would find a certain measure of satisfaction

201
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,360
and enjoyment in stretching the openings of his wounds. That's just what I said. Basically

202
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,440
the more you cover it up, the more you'll need to cover it up. And the more you'll assume

203
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,680
that covering up is sorting it out. So you will get some satisfaction in pursuing desire

204
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,640
because basically makes you forget about the pain caused by the very desire. Yes, it's

205
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,760
become a more evil smell. Because that's all you can do. Make you forget about the pain.

206
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,800
And that's why you can never satisfy a desire. And its nature is insatiable.

207
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,720
For the very reason, that all you can do is forget about the pain, the pain, the dark,

208
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,480
that it causes too. That's what people like to elaborate on their desires, not just going

209
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:30,720
to satisfy them. Because if it provides a more elaborate, forgetful cover up of the actual pain.

210
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,920
But only so for that dark to arise again, to hit you again.

211
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,360
And then when your senses do break apart, when you can't use any of those domains for this

212
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,360
game of cover up, then you just left with the pain. Which is why all age can be very high.

213
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,240
For those who depend on their senses more than others.

214
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,440
And continues, so too, Magandia beings who are not given last

215
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,880
percentual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for central pleasures,

216
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,600
who burn with the fever for central pleasures still indulge in central pleasures.

217
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,480
The more such beings indulge in central pleasures, the more they're craving for central pleasures

218
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,320
increases. And then more, they are burned with their fever for central pleasures. Yet they find

219
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,680
a certain measure, a satisfaction, an enjoyment, independence, and a five-cold central pleasure.

220
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,800
What do you think, Magandia? Have you ever seen or heard of a king or a king's minister enjoying

221
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:43,040
himself, provided an endowed with a five-cold central pleasure, who without abandoning

222
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,120
craving for central pleasures, without removing fever for central pleasures,

223
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,880
was able to abide, free from thirst, with a mind ingridly at peace,

224
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,400
or who is able, or who will be able to abide, help to so abide. No, master God to me.

225
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,560
Good, Magandia, I too have never seen or heard of a king or a king's minister enjoying himself.

226
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,640
Without abandoning craving for central pleasures, without removing fever for central pleasures,

227
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,320
who was able to abide, free from thirst, with a mind ingridly at peace, or who is,

228
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:24,160
who is able, or who will be able to so abide. On the contrary, Magandia, those recluses of

229
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:31,120
Romans who abide, or abide, or will abide, free from thirst, with a mind ingridly at peace,

230
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,520
all do so after having understood, as they actually are, the origin, the disappearance,

231
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,640
the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of central pleasures,

232
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,960
and it is after abandoning craving for central pleasures and removing fever from central pleasures,

233
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,640
that they abide, or abide, or will abide, free from thirst, with a mind ingridly at peace.

234
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,840
Then, at that point, the best one uttered this exclamation.

235
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:10,320
The greatest of all games is health. Nibbana is the greatest bliss. The eightfold path is the best

236
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,600
of paths, for it leads safely to the deathless. When this was said, the wonderer Magandia said,

237
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,920
to the best one, it is wonderful Master Gautama, it is marvelous how well that has been expressed

238
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:31,840
by Master Gautama. The greatest of all games is health. Nibbana is the greatest bliss. We too

239
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,880
have heard earlier wanderers who were teachers and teachers of teachers saying this, and it agrees

240
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:44,320
with Master Gautama. But Magandia, when you heard earlier wanderers who were teachers and teachers

241
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:52,320
of teachers saying this, what is it? What is that health? What is that Nibbana? When this was said,

242
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,800
the wonderer Magandia rubbed his own limb with his hands and said, this is that health, Master Gautama,

243
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,280
this is that Nibbana, who I am now healthy and happy, and nothing afflicts me.

244
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:15,280
Bless you. Magandia, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms,

245
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,960
who could not see blue, yellow, red or pink forms, who could not see what was even and uneven,

246
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,080
who could not see the stars of the sun and the moon. He might hear a man, hear a man with good

247
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,720
eyesight saying, good indeed serves as a white cloth, beautiful, sparkless and clean, and he would go

248
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:41,440
in search of a white cloth. Then a man were cheating with the dirty soil garments of us. Good man,

249
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,200
here as a white cloth for you, beautiful, sparkless and clean, and he would accept it and put it on,

250
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,880
and being satisfied with it, he would utter words of satisfaction thus. Good indeed serves as a

251
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,440
white cloth, beautiful, sparkless and clean. What do you think, Magandia, when that man born blind

252
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,760
accepted that dirty soil garment, put it on when being satisfied with it, uttered words of

253
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,440
satisfaction thus. Good indeed serves as a white cloth, beautiful, sparkless and clean.

254
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:18,560
Did he do so knowing and seeing or utter faith in the man with good eyesight? When also he would

255
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:26,240
have done so unknowing and unseen, utter faith in the man with good eyesight. So too, Magandia,

256
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,640
the wonderers of other sects, are blind and visionless. They do not know how, they do not see

257
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:42,000
Nibbana yet they utter this stanza thus. The greatest of all gains is health. Nibbana is the greatest bliss.

258
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,960
This stanza was uttered by the earlier accomplished ones, fully enlightened ones thus. The greatest of all

259
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,640
gains is health. Nibbana is the greatest bliss. The eightfold path is the best of paths,

260
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:02,160
but leads to safety to forgetfulness. Now it has gradually become current among ordinary people.

261
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:09,680
And although this body, Magandia, is a disease, a tumor, a dart, a calamity, and an affliction,

262
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,720
referring to this body, you say, this is that health, Master Gautama, this is that Nibbana.

263
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:24,080
You do not have that noble vision, Magandia, by means of which you might know how, and see Nibbana.

264
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,520
I have confidence in Master Gautama thus. Master Gautama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma

265
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:42,240
in such a way that I can come to know how and to see Nibbana. Magandia, suppose there was a man

266
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,160
born blind who cannot see dark and light forms, then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and

267
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,760
relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The physician would make a medicine for him,

268
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,280
yet by means of that medicine, the man's vision would not arise or be purified.

269
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,080
What do you think, Magandia? Would the doctor reap weariness and disappointment?

270
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,400
Yes, Master Gautama. So too, Magandia, if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus,

271
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,760
this is that health, this is that Nibbana. You might not know that health or see Nibbana,

272
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,640
and there would be weariness and troublesome for me.

273
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,960
I have confidence in Master Gautama thus. Master Gautama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma

274
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,480
in such a way that I can come to know how and see Nibbana.

275
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:40,720
Magandia, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms,

276
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,920
he might hear a man with good eyes saying, good indeed serves as a white cuff,

277
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,480
beautiful, spotless and clean. Anywhere you go in search of a white cuff,

278
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,720
then a man were cheating with a dirty soil garment. Thus, good man hears a white cuff,

279
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,960
and he would accept it and put it off. Then his friends and companions would bring a physician

280
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,440
to treat him, a physician would make medicine, appointments, encountering some nasal treatments,

281
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,280
and by means of that medicine the man's vision would arise and be purified.

282
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,800
Together with the rising of his vision, his desire and liking for that dirty soil garment would

283
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:28,560
be abandoned. Then he might burn with dignity, ill will towards that man and might think that

284
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:34,080
he ought to be killed thus. Indeed, I have long been tricked and cheated,

285
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,440
and he frauded by this man's dirty soil garment when he told me, good man,

286
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,400
here's a white cuff for you, beautiful, spotless and clean.

287
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,560
So to Magandia, if I were to teach you the Dhamma,

288
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,920
thus, this is that health, this is that nibbana. You might know health and see nibbana.

289
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,680
Together with the rising of your vision, your desire and lust for the five aggregates

290
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,960
affected by assumption might be abandoned. Then perhaps you might think,

291
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,680
indeed, I have been long tricked and cheated and defrauded by this mind.

292
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,160
For when assumption, when assuming I have been assuming just to material form,

293
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,960
I have been assuming just to feeling, I have been assuming just to perception,

294
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,400
I have been assuming just to determinations, I have been assuming just to consciousness.

295
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,600
With my assumption as condition being comes to be, with being as condition birth,

296
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:40,320
with birth as condition aging in death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come to be.

297
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:48,400
Such is the origin of this wholeness of suffering. I have confidence in Master Gautama,

298
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,600
thus, Master Gautama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up from

299
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:04,160
the seat cured of my blindness. Then Magandia, associate with true men. When you associate with true men,

300
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,040
you will hear the true Dhamma. When you hear the true Dhamma, you will practice in accordance with

301
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,720
the true Dhamma. When you practice in accordance with the true Dhamma, you will know and see for yourself

302
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:22,320
thus. These are diseases, tumors and darts, but here these diseases, tumors and darts cease without

303
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:30,080
remain there. With a cessation of my assumption comes cessation of being. With a cessation of being,

304
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,200
cessation of birth, cessation of birth, aging in death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair

305
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,400
cease. Such is the cessation of the whole, this whole mass of suffering.

306
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,920
When this was said, the wonder of Magandia said, magnificent Master Gautama, magnificent.

307
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:57,040
Master Gautama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were returning upright

308
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,600
or had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost,

309
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,000
or holding up a lamp in the dark, for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gautama

310
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,920
for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sunday of Brookers. I would receive the going forth

311
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:24,560
under the Master Gautama, I would receive the full admission. Magandia, one who formerly belonged to

312
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,840
the other sect and desires the going forth and full admission in this Dhamma and discipline,

313
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,080
lives on probation for four months. At the end of the four months, if the Bikus are satisfied with

314
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,280
him, they give him the going forth and full admission to the Bikus state, but I recognise individual

315
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:50,080
differences in this matter. Renable Sir, if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire

316
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,880
the going forth and full admission in this Dhamma and discipline, live on probation for four months,

317
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:02,000
and if at the end of the four months the Bikus being satisfied with them, give them the going forth

318
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,080
and full admission to the Bikus state, then I will live on probation for four years. At the end of

319
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,600
four years, the Bikus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and full admission

320
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,320
to the Bikus state. Then the wanderer Magandia receives the going forth under the blessed one,

321
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,960
and he receives the full admission and soon not long after his full admission, dwelling alone,

322
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:34,640
withdrawn and diligent, ardent and resolute, the venerable Magandia by realizing for himself

323
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,800
with direct knowledge here and now, entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life,

324
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,600
for the sake of which Clansman rightly goes forth from the home life into homelessness.

325
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:52,960
He directly knew, the birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, but had to be done,

326
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,440
has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being, and the venerable Magandia became one

327
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:18,480
of the elements. I like the fact that he wasn't, you know, he was determined, he didn't really matter

328
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,360
if he went forth, but he was still going to do it, you know, listen to it, listen to take on the

329
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:31,120
Buddhist teaching, go forth, no matter how long it took. Because he doesn't know. Going forth

330
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:39,840
he's just got an external means, a statement, a livelihood and shown that, yeah, for somebody

331
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:45,920
he came and destroyed the dam, right there and then, yeah, he doesn't matter, four months, four years,

332
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:54,320
two months, two months, because he'll be doing the same thing, he'll be practicing the droward, renunciation,

333
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,200
dwelling resolute. He'll be a resident, yeah. Yeah, basically dwelling resolute.

334
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,240
One thing is to understand, but another thing is to stick to it, for as long as it is necessary,

335
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,560
for all of the assumptions and habits of desires to claim, for some people it will take longer,

336
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,440
for some people it will take shorter time, but without being reserved. But exactly, yeah,

337
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,480
the resolution needs to be there, obviously resolution is possible only once understanding

338
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:34,080
as a resident, if you know what you're supposed to be a resident, but, you know, the resolution

339
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:41,360
in the world will help you. But what about the strength, if you say never again? Yeah, sure.

340
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:55,040
But obviously, again, never again, might free, if they stick to it, might free people from

341
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,760
central desire, but it's still not necessarily, doesn't mean that they will have the right view

342
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,320
in terms of the dam and the ban, because the Buddha did say, even the Tuzuna can experience

343
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,440
dispassion in this caste in regard to sensuality. And in three, he himself from it,

344
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,320
but he can't free himself from other assumptions, assumptions of self, of conceit and so on.

345
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,720
But obviously, it would be much easier for somebody who is free from sensuality to then understand

346
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,040
the dam, then from somebody who isn't. Why? Because it's already kind of understood the principle

347
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:38,640
of assumption. It just needs to be pointed out that very fact, the Padana of sensual pressures

348
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,280
of craving has been obviously abandoned. So he needs to dwell on the nature of that abandonment

349
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,920
and then apply the same to the sense of self and his conceit and then he'll be in the barn.

350
00:37:49,920 --> 00:38:03,120
And obviously, he can do that unless he's, somebody points that out to somebody who knows.

351
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,480
Yeah, Timi was a resolute means of it. You don't take,

352
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:19,360
you see the goal, you take nothing less than that, and that's what you're striving for.

353
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,680
Yeah, the solution can be basically, can take many forms. You can be a resolute for the rest of your life.

354
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:34,880
Any central pleasure that comes within the range of your senses, you will basically override

355
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:42,240
the vision of pain, and dark, and burning embers. Why? Because that's how they actually are.

356
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,240
You might not necessarily see that, but you took it off faith because the Buddha said it.

357
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,040
And if you keep applying it, because it is so, it will take its roots. And then you will see it,

358
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,000
so obviously you can take on faith wrong instruction and then no matter applying it,

359
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,320
it will result in seeing it clearly as such, because it's not as such. But sensuality is as such,

360
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,320
so you're kind of emulating seeing it as such, like overriding with your resolution,

361
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,040
will result to you eventually seeing it for what it is, as such.

362
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,160
So that's basically those people who practice some faith, they take on faith and they just stick to it.

363
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,480
Yes, it's been made pretty clear.

364
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,040
And I don't think, you know, if there is a resolution, if there is a restraint, if there is a

365
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,080
virtue established, I don't think it will take too long for one to start seeing that actually

366
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:46,000
they are painful. It won't be before too long before it becomes apparent that the pain

367
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
of restraint is not of restraint, but it's revealed by restraint and it's of the senses,

368
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,040
of the desire. That is the first point of contact, with sense, something like with the central

369
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:07,760
pleasure, the first point of contact is pain. Always, everything else, all the pleasure you

370
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:14,560
then get from giving into those desires is built on top of those burning embers, which means

371
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:26,000
they themselves are certainly not pleasant. Well, the rising essential pleasure, basically,

372
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,400
you can pin down on your assumption of, in regard to central pleasure, the assumption that

373
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:40,720
they are worthy and pleasant, which means you will pray for them. And craving for them will then

374
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,040
make them, make you regard them as even more pleasant and so on, for it will feed itself.

375
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,360
You stop craving for them, sensuality cannot arise. Agreeable beautiful objects in the world

376
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,920
will still arise, but they will not induce central desire.

377
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,280
So you recognize the sensuality, like beautiful sights, for example, are confined

378
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:17,600
to the domain of sight, to the eyes. And then there is essential desire to see something beautiful.

379
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,160
If you say no to it, you will experience pain, because that's what the desire is, pain.

380
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,480
And people don't experience pain, because their minds are already far out in the anticipation

381
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,480
of satisfaction of the desire. So they are already running, even before the dog started the

382
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:48,160
aching level. But all you have to do is just stop and the pain will arise. And then, as I said,

383
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,040
with some instruction and diligence and resolve it, but if you become apparent that

384
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,880
that pain, like bigger small sometimes, doesn't matter, it's the pain of the actual sensual touch.

385
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,680
It's the pain of craving, present, simultaneously, with the agreeable beautiful object in the world.

386
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,840
So then you remove the craving. And what you have is just beautiful objects in the world.

387
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,000
But no desire for them.

388
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:31,760
So seeing craving is pain, simultaneously. Exactly. And that brings you to the well-other approach,

389
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,400
the approach of four noble truths with Tanha, with craving, suffering is. So whenever there is pain,

390
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,920
there is craving. So if you suffer on account of sensuality, it's because you crave. And then

391
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:56,480
that's what sensuality is. Sensuality is craving for sensuality. As a whole, as a unit, that's what

392
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,640
sensuality is. Craving for sensuality, for pleasures derived through the sensuality.

393
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,920
That is sensuality. Thus you can rightly say sensuality is painful and unpleasant,

394
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,680
because you can't have sensuality, then, without the main component of craving for the sensuality.

395
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:28,720
So it's a semi-danger of craving. You see the pain, there is pain, there is suffering.

396
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:36,320
The danger of craving, basically, craving for pleasure derived from sensuality,

397
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:44,000
well, sensuality cannot be discerned if there are no operating functional, living healthy senses.

398
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,520
But that's something that's completely obscured, because as I said, the mind is already out there

399
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,680
with the actual pleasures, with the derived from it, which means you took everything that preceded

400
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:01,280
those pleasures, you took that to granted. You made it big. Bava is there, sensual being is there.

401
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:13,600
Your mind is far away from it, but dependent on it. So then, as I said, if your mind is fully dependent

402
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:20,720
on the pleasures derived by the sense-base and sense-objects, if something happens to sense-base

403
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,360
and sense-objects and something will happen, because they're not in your control, then the mind

404
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,840
will be cut away with it. That is what death is. Being swept with the floods,

405
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,280
let's sweep away your body, your five senses. So unless you climb down that tree,

406
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,040
those sensed trees on the safe ground, when they're taking down, you will crash with them.

407
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,760
So that is the danger, that's a real death, that's what death is. Death cannot touch you.

408
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,080
If your mind is withdrawn from the dependence on the pleasure of the senses.

409
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:10,000
So somebody, just all you have to do is just contemplate losing your ears,

410
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,240
you're losing your life. And then, like, say there is an imminent danger of death,

411
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,120
no amount of sense desire will override that. No matter how strong it was before, the fact that

412
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,960
the very next second, you might be dead, you will drop everything you will do, everything you want

413
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,360
to do, everything you will engage with. And most likely, a normal person will freak out.

414
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,200
Become religious. Because they only will become religious. Start praying to the divine providence

415
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,800
and develop a faith that everything will end up well for you. It's basically the whole purpose

416
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,360
of that. Again, it's the same. It emulates the principle of centrality. You will hit by the pain,

417
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:01,440
you cover it up with a pleasant desire. You will hit by the pain of non-central nature.

418
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,320
You cover it up with the assumptions of everything will be fine. Again, pleasure, peaceful, it's okay.

419
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,920
So, the whole purpose of human religiousness and superstition is a cover-up,

420
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:22,480
is just extension of centrality. Hence, it's another type of upadana, as the Buddha said.

421
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:36,080
See about the Parmas. Basically, belief, assuming, holding onto virtue, duties,

422
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:54,080
extension into religion and so on, holding onto views, assuming the views. That's also comes under it.

423
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:06,080
It was a good to know because the greatest of happiness, the most people, is a fully functional,

424
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:14,080
healthy, strong body that can take you around and get all those pages. That's like the peak.

425
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,840
Happiness, you can imagine. Which is simultaneously the peak of the danger.

426
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:29,040
It means that when you are dependent, you are blind. Like you are not aware of it,

427
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,400
because you are too far out with the expectations of pleasure. That's with the dependence in

428
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:44,400
its full highest swing. The person might start withdrawing from the central pleasures when

429
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,400
senses start failing. However, if you wait for your senses to start failing and then withdraw,

430
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,240
well, you are not withdrawing. You are being withdrawn. And then what you're going to have,

431
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:00,400
then you're going to have views and also assumptions based on that. Now, you cannot undo.

432
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,360
Because it's kind of too late, basically. Your dependence only has been 45.

433
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:16,240
That's the danger of all age, basically. I mean, theoretically, it's still possible to

434
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,840
approve it all and become an out of hand, but highly unlikely. Why? Because I mean,

435
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:27,920
the habit of dependence on the senses has been calculated manyfold. Much longer than for somebody

436
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,960
who has spent your 30 years old. Which means also to views and assumptions on top of that

437
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:44,800
have risen. And now the senses have declined and show your ability to kind of experience the

438
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,360
central pleasure has declined, but not the assumption of the pleasures of the senses.

439
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,360
That has stayed. And now you have no kind of reference point for that to undo it.

440
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:03,040
When your senses were still there, you could see a direct link, direct dependence.

441
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:09,120
On your assumptions upon the central pleasures and everything else and the actual operating senses.

442
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,040
But now the senses are gone and you're so oblivious in regard to them ignorant, deluded,

443
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:23,680
indolent. It's virtually impossible. Here, I think it's possible, but highly unlikely.

444
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,280
So, the longer you wait, as the Buddha said, actually, that's okay. You just read it.

445
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,800
The longer you engage with sensuality, the stronger it gets.

446
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,280
The more dependent upon it, you become. It means more painful, it will be saying no to it.

447
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,640
Or rather, the greater pain will be revealed by saying no to it. And mine cannot take the pain.

448
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,920
Untrained mind cannot take the pain. And what will untrained mind, which cannot take the pain,

449
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,400
do? Try to avoid the pain, but it only means that it knows. Means of sensuality.

450
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:07,600
So, you end up revolving around that, which causes you pain. You're using that to avoid that pain.

451
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,720
Think about it, you can win yourself off of sensual pain.

452
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,800
No, you can't do that either.

453
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,440
But just a little bit. I used to have a lot of it.

454
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,160
As the Buddha said, in regard to the being, and there is a being of sensual pleasures as well,

455
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,360
he said, basically, that as much as a large lump of extremance instincts,

456
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,800
even the small bits of extremance share the same stink, same foul smell,

457
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,600
same goes for the being of any kind, same goes for sensuality. So,

458
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:47,600
winning yourself off extremance with little extremance is no meaning of self of extremance smell at all.

459
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,000
The extremance smell is the present. It doesn't matter the amount of it.

460
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:04,400
How big the lump is.

461
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:15,920
So, for example, about some of these, doing something innocence, you know, well,

462
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,520
not so bad. That's still a distraction. Watching movies, watching movies, distracting yourself.

463
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,920
So, it's not a horrible thing. You're watching action movies or whatever.

464
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,200
And then, the person says, okay, well, that's distracting. That's got nothing to do with

465
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,120
Dumma. That's got nothing to do with her life. Therefore, I will watch something with,

466
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,800
we've got a, you know, connected to Dumma. Dumma movie.

467
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,880
Well, there is no such thing. But then I will connect it to old age and death,

468
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,600
never I'm winning myself off.

469
00:51:53,600 --> 00:52:00,560
Yeah, but see the point is, you turn a blind eye to the fact that the purpose of a movie is,

470
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:08,000
sorry, the purpose of the movies in general is entertainment. It's distraction. It's taking

471
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,760
your mind away. And that taking your mind away, it's nothing other than moha, the delusion,

472
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:23,280
the indolence of the mind. As I was saying yesterday, delusion is, it's not a kind of a hidden secret

473
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,040
truth that you're not aware of. You're deluded, you know, delusion is an attitude of mind

474
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,800
in the same sense, anger is and lust is. That's why it's lust, aversion and delusion.

475
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,440
So, sure, you might watch a Dumma movie that does not have the explicit sensuality,

476
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,000
provocativeness and so on. But the fact is that you're engaging in the indolence of mind,

477
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,400
why you let your mind go over the movies, let the story unfold, take your mind on a ride,

478
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,760
which is not necessarily sensual ride, but it's the ride of the vision, the ride of indolence,

479
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,800
which is basically that which is kind of underlying both, lust and anger.

480
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,840
Your mind is never indolent, it cannot give in to lust nor anger.

481
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,400
But if you're practicing delusion, basically, if you're practicing indolence,

482
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,640
means you remain liable to lust, you remain accessible to lust, lust remains possible.

483
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:27,600
So, sure, you can watch all sorts of documentaries and informative movies and whatever else,

484
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,800
the fact is your mind goes in the state of indolence, which means when the lust comes,

485
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,880
you will not be fortified in regard to it.

486
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,680
So, there is no excuse for it.

487
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:47,040
It's a non-indolence. If you remain non-indolent, you will not give in to any distraction,

488
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:55,360
no matter how informative, inverted, comma, this, because Dharma is to be known individually,

489
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,040
internally, by the wise, not on a big screen.

490
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,120
And even if this is the movie about the Buddha's life, again, it could be watched as distraction.

491
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,640
Because the only way to remain mindful of the movie is to basically not give in all of it,

492
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,640
and that means why watch it in the first place.

493
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,320
Same like reading novels or books of any kind,

494
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,200
to the man to take the mind away.

495
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,840
It's not as bad as, you know, full-on pursuit of sensuality in a binging manner,

496
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,760
but it's certainly maintaining the indolence of the mind,

497
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,280
maintaining the delusion, maintaining the ignoring of the nature of Venus.

498
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:45,440
And that's an important point, because many people still have notions and assumptions

499
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:51,520
that delusion, and even Avija, it's kind of, you know, this metaphysical ignorance

500
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,520
that is then revealed by some extraordinary transcendental experience.

501
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,760
It's not. It's the, it's something you engage most often.

502
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,520
More often than sensuality, more often than anger.

503
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,000
That's what Avija is. That's what delusion is.

504
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,760
It's indolence of the mind.

505
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,160
It's, it's, it's a muddleness, black clarity.

506
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,800
And that you maintain that. People maintain that.

507
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,920
You maintain it through sensuality, you maintain it through anger,

508
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,280
you maintain it through ignorance choices, you maintain it through distraction and dependence on distraction.

509
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,640
That's why you remove a distraction from, well,

510
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,800
remove all of the distractions from a normal person out there in the world,

511
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,880
and they'll, they'll freak out.

512
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,960
The border will start creeping in, and then the border will reveal a peril behind it.

513
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,280
A real genuine fear of, and threat, a real genuine threat of sinking into your own mind,

514
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,080
and drowning there, going man basically.

515
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,840
So, quickly, provide with some distractions, give me something to do.

516
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,200
You know, it's devoted to weightiness, it's saying.

517
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,440
Yeah.

518
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,360
Which is, it sounds nice, like, you know, but it's quite a heavy thing to do.

519
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,720
It's a heavy thing to do initially, but until you, until you still have the,

520
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,960
the pull of the senses and so on, it feels like a heavy word, but it is, it is a heavy word initially.

521
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,440
As we spoke in, was a couple of days ago, like a, like a, like a herdsman looking after the cow.

522
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,600
While the cows are still wild and unrestrained, it's going to be a lot of work to keep

523
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,280
them away from the heavy fields, from eating other people's crops.

524
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,920
But once they are tamed and come down, then it's just pure pleasure.

525
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,840
You just sit, you don't even have to move.

526
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,560
They'll listen to you.

527
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,040
They don't go.

528
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:47,600
So, yeah, initially for a person who never practiced weightfulness,

529
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
it's going to be the hardest task in the world.

530
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,280
Because it's devoted to weightfulness means less sleep.

531
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,800
Means less sleep even when you're awake.

532
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,320
Yeah, that means less distractions means, means not resting mentally.

533
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,960
It doesn't mean you're full engaging constant effort,

534
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:14,960
but means you're engaged in non-resting, like the similar of a, of a cow.

535
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,480
But if it sits down, it's being eaten by the animals, devoured by the animals that live on the ground.

536
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,320
If it leans, something stands up and leans, if something's devoured by the animals that,

537
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,200
that live on the trees that it leans and so on.

538
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,720
So basically, no position of the mind you give in to that kind of,

539
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,840
just the rest of five minutes.

540
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,440
You can rest your body only once.

541
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,160
Let me shut it. But mind is exactly, no shut enough.

542
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,640
Why? Because actually, shutting off, it's not necessary.

543
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,320
That's why delusion, it's a habit.

544
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,520
A Vigia is a habit that's being maintained through a Vigia.

545
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,960
Ignorance is determined by ignorance.

546
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,240
And the Buddha said that, and the Vira mentions as well.

547
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:05,040
So the point is, once the mind is straining weightfulness,

548
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,320
weightfulness is effortless.

549
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,680
And then it ceases to be a chore.

550
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,680
It becomes a very pleasant place for a body. It becomes nibana.

551
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:36,240
Well, as long as a Vigia is not entirely approved, exactly, a Vigia will try to maintain itself.

552
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,840
So in the same sense, basically, that a person sees danger in centrality,

553
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,640
sees it as burning embers, so should the indolence of the mind be seen as well,

554
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,920
non-weightfulness. And that is, the Buddha said, the ones who are not mindful

555
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:15,440
are already as dead.

556
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,240
So living is quite difficult, we are living in it.

557
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,560
Real living is a full-time task.

558
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,240
I had, again, what Nabila said.

559
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,920
It's not some life, it's not something you just float and fly over and go through,

560
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,200
it becomes actually a full-time task.

561
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,720
Even for the one who is not necessarily crazy for a lunch, it just wants to live authentically,

562
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,360
wants to live responsibly, wants to live mindfully.

563
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:56,720
Because it is that, anyway, like if a Patujana, a Sutta, a Patujana,

564
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:02,160
are instructed without any regard, it's also a task, it's even worse, because he's making

565
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:07,360
it worse through ignoring it. He's making his itch worse through constantly scratching it.

566
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,840
He's making more powerful each time, which means each time you'll need to work even harder.

567
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:41,600
You can never have too much of mindfulness, and if you have too much of anything else,

568
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,880
mindfulness will even eat out, if mindfulness is established.

569
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:59,920
Clarity of the mind, non-modernness, so to speak, clear thinking,

570
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,200
and restraint of the senses.

571
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:14,240
Then even a very little of the instruction from the Sutta's and the Buddha will be required,

572
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:22,240
because the ground is very fertile, set up. Everything is there, ready, in the right order.

573
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,400
Purify, then you need very little instruction to fix it up,

574
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:36,400
once and for all.
