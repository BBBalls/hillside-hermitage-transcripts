00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How to calm the mind of the freshness of thoughts, the right thoughts, or the right thoughts

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
or the right mind?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, the overactive thoughts are basically already a symptom of you being overly committed

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or overly engaged or overly invested emotionally in things.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So you can't necessarily directly just go ahead and stop your thoughts, because that will be

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
also a form of thinking, which means you'll be contradicting internally.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But what you can do is basically see how they came to be.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How did you end up in a place of your mind spinning out of control?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And I think always you will find out that it's because you were not restrained beforehand.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You were not restraining things you said, things you done, things you wanted to do.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And now obviously the mind is still sort of running on that momentum.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So the most you can do in those cases is just not add more to it.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't do any things by body speech or further by mind on account of a restless spinning out of control mind.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But endure it because it will tie it out and calm down.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But you try to learn from it in a sense of this is an indication of a problem.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's not a problem in itself.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The problem in itself is basically the fact that you were acting under strain.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As in, you know, you got into an argument, you said things out of heat.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Or some like, I don't know, over engaged in centrality.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And then you're already committed and you couldn't stop when you wanted to.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now you're paying the consequences and things didn't end up the way you wanted to and so on.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And then yes, then the mind is just going to be revolving like crazy.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But because of your behavior, you wouldn't have had the ground

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
normal momentum for such a for such a wild spinning if you didn't provide it for it.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But if you just try to, I must stop thinking and give me meditation.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And he's, I'll stop thinking yet, not change my behavior.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's just, it won't work.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Because most of these things, when they pretend to mind more of like symptoms of the underlying issue,

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
of greed, aversion, delusion, ill will, last and so on,

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
they were not the problem in themselves.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because people usually think our meditation or something will help me like control my mind.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But underneath that, I'll still do whatever I want to do, whenever I want to do it, however I want to do it.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And it doesn't work like that.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You want to quit things.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, well, basically you want, you want to believe that removal of the symptoms

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
removes the underlying illness.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It doesn't work.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What about, like, undecisive indecisiveness?

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Shoulder chooses, shoulder chooses.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, that's, that's fine.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's fine.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
In a way of, well, fine to a degree, but obviously it can become an issue when you just can't commit to a choice.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
When you, when you expect choice to be made for you, so you don't feel responsible.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And even that, again, that is again a symptom of you not accepting responsibility in the first place.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Because whatever you choose, even if, even if it feels like that the choice was placed upon you by circumstances,

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you choose to accept it, because you can say no to anything.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So if you start thinking along those lines in terms of that you kind of only responsibility no matter what you do,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
then it becomes different.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then you will obviously think twice, even in regard to small decisions.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But then at the same time, you won't feel like it's the end of the world in regard to big decisions.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because responsibility has been brought back on you, so you can't.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're not ignoring it anymore.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And that's why people get into that, and the size of state.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's because really what they're indecisive about is whether they should take responsibility or not.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But that's what I mean.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you start reflecting upon it, you'll see that that's not an optional matter.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You are already responsible.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So the first line, you will make a good decision.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, a better decision, yeah.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You might not end up the way you will hope to, but you won't be affected by that as much as you would if you try to pretend that you are not responsible in the first place.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's what people think.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Like if they're refrained from choice, they think they're not choosing.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But refrained from choice is your choice in regard to some other particular choices, which means it's equally a choice.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But if I don't commit to this or that, I avoid being sort of burdened by those things.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But actually, you were just burdened by non-committal, which can be even worse burdened because it's much harder to see.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And it doesn't be stuck in it for a very long time.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, yeah, forever.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Forever, I mean, rather than speaking, but yeah.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It sort of, it establishes itself on the level of a view.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So unless you dig it up yourself and sort of develop transparency through it and see what it is,

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
then you will maintain that view for the rest of your life.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And thank you for awarding your responsibility.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Just in reality, all you're doing really is making less...

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, making choices from a more inferior perspective.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Because once you accept responsibility, your perspective is much bigger.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's more unpleasant initially, but overall, actually, you have a greater perspective on those.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And wait and what they entail.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You know the responsibility, you're more like reactionary sort of reacting to this or that.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And then just hope things will end up well.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But they don't.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I mean, what you regard well, maybe.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But overall, they don't.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because the worst thing you can do is ignore responsibility for your own existence.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So it's better off to accept responsibility.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then even if all of your choices end up in failure or whatever,

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and you haven't achieved anything you hope for, you still took responsibility for it.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And that's a greater achievement, actually, than any of those particular achievements of your choice.
