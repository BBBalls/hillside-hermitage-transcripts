1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,880
I had a couple of thoughts.

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,240
One thing I thought about was a heedfulness or diligence. They're translated in different

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:41,520
ways. So the quality that the Buddha says is where all skillful qualities converge and

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:56,880
is the way to not decline in the Dhamma. So what is it? And who does it apply to? Where

5
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:13,480
does it start? Anybody else want to say something? So the heedfulness, so can somebody without

6
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:26,320
the right view, be heedful? No. In a common sense, yes. Whatever you want to achieve,

7
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,880
you have to be heedful. So it actually applies even before. In a sense that if you recognize

8
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,840
that it is your task to develop the right view and then you are heedful in regard to

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,800
that task, it is the heedfulness that will make you seek the right view. And then obviously

10
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,000
once you have the right view, that heedfulness will make you develop it further. So that's

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,720
why the Buddha singled it out as the soul factor, because he would actually pertain to

12
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,720
somebody from the moment of hearing about the possibility of freedom from suffering to

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,160
the moment of understanding the freedom from suffering and then fully developing it. If

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:12,640
he is heedful, he would find a way. Will that alone make him find a way? No, of course not.

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,560
That's why you can be heedful, but if you don't come across the right instruction, if

16
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,560
you don't attend to it rightly, you won't. You won't get the right view. It seems to

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,080
me there is a difference, something of a difference in what would constitute heedfulness, like

18
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,400
you'd be heedful in regard to what for somebody without the right view, as opposed to being

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,520
heedful in regard to what should be. So what should a person without a right view be heedful

20
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:54,120
about? What I was thinking was mainly, well, heedful of the peril of not having the right

21
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:02,560
view or knowing that you're heedful of the fact that you're not sot upon it, and take

22
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:12,520
that seriously in that sense. So if a person is heedful about it, they won't slack the

23
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,520
effort. They won't sort of fall into the assumption that they know that which they don't, and

24
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,480
so on, because they would constantly be heedful about the fact that, well, am I free from

25
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,360
the first three fetters? Do I see the Four Noble Truths? Am I my own guide? Do I need

26
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,320
to defend my views? Am I beyond doubt all of that? It's like, no, no, no, no, no. Well,

27
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,600
then I'm not there yet, so I should remain heedful. So in other words, heedful would

28
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,520
pretty much stand for being, at that stage, would stand, actually at any stage, would

29
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:53,360
stand for being honest and authentic. So a sot upon a sakkadagam yanagami should also

30
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,760
be heedful of the fact that they still have work to do. So it would be the same principle.

31
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,520
And it's a bit like mindfulness. You can't have too much.

32
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,680
Exactly. Exactly. Which I think it's hard sometimes translated as well, kind of synonymously.

33
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,680
But yeah, you can't be too heedful of the fact that you don't have the right view or

34
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,800
of the fact that you're not on the other hand yet and so on. That will keep you practicing

35
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:37,240
and directed towards the practice. So it seems to me that heedfulness also refers somewhat

36
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:46,280
not only to specific things you do, but like the extent to which you do them, not only

37
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,560
in the sense of how intensely, let's say, you practice, if you, I don't know, you could

38
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,600
do extremely intense, trying to think about things and contemplate things and be as always,

39
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,160
you didn't do everything right for half a day, but if the rest of the day you're not,

40
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,000
yeah, yeah, sure. That constitutes just acting out of overly determined mind, which sure,

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,320
if you know what you're determining, it can be beneficial, but in and of itself, yeah.

42
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,080
It's not where heedfulness is on the level of mindfulness, context, recollecting your

43
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,440
situation, what are you still subjected to, what are the, can the non-reason lust arise,

44
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,920
can the non-reason anger arise, can the non-reason hindrances hinder you, all of that is reflected

45
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,800
through on a kind of heedfulness. Well, let me actually be careful and check these things.

46
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,560
I might be fine now, but do I know for sure I will remain fine in the future if circumstances

47
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:57,720
change, if things change, and so on. And then keeping that in mind, not slackening

48
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:06,600
in regard to it, in the sense that, you know, you can't think, oh, I'll just do this for

49
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,280
a certain amount of time and then I'll take a break. It has to be basically done up to

50
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,520
the point, up to the extent necessary. Yeah, you can, you can take a break from the individual

51
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,360
determinations of, I'll do this or I'll do that, if it's too much, if it's too tight,

52
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,560
but there is never a reason to take a break from heedfulness, inasmuch there's never

53
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,720
a reason to take a break from mindfulness. It's exactly the same, the same thing.

54
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,880
Can I take a break now? Yeah. Is there a danger of me taking a break now?

55
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,040
So I can take a relative break in a sense of I mustn't forget that, yeah, there's still

56
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,800
work to be done. So sure, I need to catch my breath. You can't just keep going in the

57
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,840
same pace. But that, that needs to be understood that heedfulness and mindfulness, there is

58
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,600
never a reason or a justification to take a break from. So to that extent, you should

59
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:08,120
never rest, because if your rest requires you to, to ignore heedfulness and mindfulness,

60
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,800
means it's a rest of essential distracting kind, for sure.

61
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:22,880
It's like, um, craving always leads to suffering. So there's never a situation where like relaxing

62
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,840
and, unless you're completely free from it, yeah, then relaxing it would mean inducing

63
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,280
it. So relaxing from heedfulness and mindfulness so that, like a general sort of enduring memory

64
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,400
of your situation, of your liabilities, of all of that, that gives rise to identification,

65
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,000
personality view, craving, everything else. That is already there, underlying tendencies,

66
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,000
thinking for things to become suitable for them to appear. So mindfulness, that's what

67
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,800
mindfulness is, the path to that deftlessness, to freedom from all of it. And it's, it's,

68
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,680
it's kind of learning how to be heedful and mindful without needing to do it on account

69
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,800
of your determination and inspiration, because then when those things are gone, your heedfulness

70
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
and mindfulness is gone, and then you're back pretty much in the perilous state of sensuality

71
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,680
and liabilities, because they are, if they're fully understood, or at least initially understood

72
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
correctly, you would get a hint that they are truly effortless. So you don't need to

73
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,720
rest from something that doesn't require effort.

74
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,040
Then does that mindfulness, that heedfulness become effortless?

75
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,120
By understanding it, understanding the nature of it.

76
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:56,240
And what factor is the, allows it to be effortless? So you cannot understand it. Mindfulness is

77
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,040
this, heedfulness is that, but there's another factor which, if you see, you are automatically

78
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,640
careful, if you develop it automatically.

79
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
Well, like you also, you only want to see God.

80
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah, we'll see the danger. See the danger, yeah. Attending to it rightly.

81
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,320
There are snakes in this forest.

82
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
Knowledge of that makes you heedful.

83
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,520
Yeah, so you're always remembering, oh yeah, snakes, oh yeah, if I get bitten by a snake.

84
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,120
Yeah, so that's why, like again, mindfulness established correctly, invested effort in,

85
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,560
in that sense, like you do need to initially make the effort to recollect the context and

86
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,320
protect the context, but yeah, it gives rise to knowledge, to the recognition of certain

87
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,800
universal principles, and exactly the dangers, how to attend to these things without losing

88
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,520
the sight of the danger and so on.

89
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,200
And that is the, you know, like the, the, the famous practice of Anapanasati, it's really

90
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,640
not a meditation practice, it's a practice of mindfulness, which of course, is a meditation

91
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,880
itself, but not the way people usually think.

92
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,080
So the whole, the whole idea of, of these types of cultivation, the Satipatanas, the

93
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:19,120
Anapanasati, is just to permeate all the aspects of your experience with the same recollectiveness

94
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,160
and same heedfulness.

95
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:28,920
So in regards to body, feeling, states of mind, and thoughts.

96
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,760
So in other words, when I'm trying to say, even when people sometimes have this determination

97
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,940
to practice meditation, they don't realize that Anapanasati does not lead you to the

98
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,880
absorptions and experience of pleasantly blissive Jan or whatever you perceive it to be.

99
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:51,560
It actually leads you to being incapable of becoming unmindful and unheedful, so to speak.

100
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,520
So yes, if you have a determination to practice meditation, practice the same heedfulness

101
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,720
and mindfulness, sure, want a kind of knowledge of your breath, knowledge of your own sense

102
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,680
of self-breeding like this, breathing like that, doesn't matter, knowledge of how you

103
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,280
feel while you breathe, or while you are kind of walking, extending your limbs, eating,

104
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:17,080
dwelling in solitude, basically, all of these things are there as your situation, as the

105
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:25,400
basis, the form, the feeling, all of that, and all you need to do is learn how to see

106
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:35,240
them, discern them, be mindful and heedful in regard to them without needing to do them,

107
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,960
and without forgetting about them either, so that's the tuning of the strings.

108
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:51,000
So in regard to that, there is this, let's say, subtle but kind of important distinction

109
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,240
that you need to learn how to see them and discern them, then you need to be heedful

110
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,920
in regard to them.

111
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,880
So there is a point where you need to kind of balance or stop trying to see and discern

112
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
them.

113
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,320
And that balance would be the beginning of correct heedfulness and mindfulness.

114
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,160
That balance would be the beginning of correct Samadhi, where you're not overly concentrating

115
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,280
and trying to do it, do it, but at the same time, you're incapable of forgetting it.

116
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,560
So it's effortless.

117
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:33,440
And that point where you say, okay, this is where I just need to be heedful, like, okay,

118
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,600
these are the snakes in this forest, like you said.

119
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,920
Now that is dangerous, I recognize that, so now let me just keep being heedful in regard

120
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:53,120
to that, but the mind tends to keep wanting, no, no, no, I need to keep, you know, how

121
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,320
can I be sure that this is enough, basically, how can I, so...

122
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Mind tends to overdo it.

123
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Yeah.

124
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Wanting to keep doing it, overtighten it, overdo it.

125
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,080
Or dismiss the whole thing, I'll run away from this forest, but that's impossible either.

126
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,800
So you realize, well, you can try to run away, which always resulted in you returning back

127
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,640
in the forest and getting bitten by snakes, because you didn't discern them sufficiently

128
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,920
enough where the dangers are, or exactly becoming overly invested in discerning even stuff that

129
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,960
you don't really need to discern in that sense.

130
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:36,000
So knowing where to stop, knowing to recognize where that kind of middle ground is, that

131
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,800
then if you dwell on, invest in, protect, it can grow, but not if you over-tighten,

132
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,840
or if it's too loose either.

133
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:59,760
Because is it a snake example, you know, walking people who would know they're snakes and then

134
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,640
be hitting the ground constantly with a stick as you're walking through the forest and you

135
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,000
just, but, and then when something happens, like there's danger, there's danger somewhere,

136
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,720
you know, there's insects, there's snakes, there's this, there's this disease everywhere.

137
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,200
And then when something, was that the bat, was that the rabies, was that the disease

138
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,280
of that I'm waiting for?

139
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,520
So you just completely, as if you were already bitten, you don't, you've gone too far, too

140
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,400
tight in your, you're careful, but you've lost it, you've lost the context, you've lost

141
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,000
the plot completely, and then if something does really bite you, you're done.

142
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,920
So yeah, you need to have that balance and see, okay, there is no, there's nothing here,

143
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,600
you have a context, there's nothing biting you, so you can, then you can walk through

144
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,320
the forest barefoot.

145
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,800
To be able to basically kind of draw a line for yourself as to how far you will allow

146
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
to act out.

147
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,120
Okay, so there are pile of leaves here, you know, huntiners might be hiding in it, so

148
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,200
let me sweep it, but that doesn't mean now, for the rest of my time in the forest, I will

149
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,000
walk with a broom everywhere.

150
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,120
No, if it looks too, I avoid it, if it doesn't, it's all right.

151
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,480
But if you start giving in, to know I'll sweep this and I'll sweep it, means you started

152
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,160
acting out of fear and concern, and then you are losing perspective, which means now you

153
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
are even more exposed.

154
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,440
So basically, the more you act out towards defending what you obviously implicitly took

155
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,440
as valuable and yours, well, the wider the basis of the danger that you're applicable

156
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,080
to becomes.

157
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:47,720
That's that, that, that monk that was in the arhant in the suttas, well, people didn't

158
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,840
know he was an arhant, going around the forest saying, oh, what a pleasure, what a joy, what

159
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
a bliss.

160
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,920
And they thought, oh, he must be remembering his former wives or something.

161
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,000
So they went and told the Buddha, they would have called him, says, what do you refer to

162
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,720
when you talk about his pleasure and the bliss?

163
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Is it previous sensuality?

164
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
It's like, no, no, no, no, no, quite the opposite.

165
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,640
He was a prince having five causes of sensual bliss, but constantly fearing for his life,

166
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,600
whether his wives were killing or his relatives or his parents, because he was basically in

167
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,560
line for the throne or whatever.

168
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,480
So he was, he had all the guards and all the palaces, but he could never have a moment

169
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,160
to peace, because he was just, the more he was defending himself and all the possible

170
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,160
permutations of the danger and the attacks, the more vulnerable he was becoming internally.

171
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,080
He was being attacked by, that's already a form of fear, you're already being attacked.

172
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,880
And then when he abandoned the entire ownership, identity, craving, became an arhant, he said,

173
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,800
now I live in this forest with his factual dangers, tiger's, elephant's, snakes, yet

174
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,240
I have no slightest concern for my life.

175
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,600
And whenever he remembers how he used to live his home, I go, what a pleasure, this is now.

176
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,640
Like immeasurable safety amidst the danger.

177
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:03,680
And it starts by not acting out, it starts by not really going out of your way to defend

178
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,280
and address all the possible, suffering will land on you.

179
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,400
So use common sense, as those other suitors say, like, okay, well, there's a clearly raging

180
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,440
elephant or a group of bandits or something, okay, avoid it until you're an arhant, then

181
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,320
you'll know what to do or what not to do.

182
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,760
But that doesn't mean you're not justified to be like, well, maybe this, maybe this,

183
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,400
or this, but theater here, this is, yeah, it might be.

184
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:39,760
So like the highest safety is not needing any protection.

185
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:47,320
But until you reach that point, it is that heedfulness that is kind of your refuge, if

186
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:56,320
you discern it correctly, like seeing how far the, seeing the danger in, well, in things

187
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,720
that are impermanent and things that are suffering in the nature of things that you would usually

188
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,800
like to depend on, then the only thing that you can depend on is your heedfulness, basically.

189
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,640
Well, the thing that you, that you can't ultimately depend on that will lead you to

190
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
not needing to depend on anything.

191
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
You're becoming negligent, that's it.

192
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,440
And the more that you dwell on, see that's, yeah, the one with the right view, if you

193
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:36,160
dwell on the nature of impermanence, nature of suffering, that naturally the mind turns

194
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,960
towards seeing danger in acting negligently in regard to that, or becoming, or heedless

195
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
in regard to that, forgetting that.

196
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,320
So it's like you don't need to do anything more, or extra, or, yeah, just within that,

197
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,560
you need to start finding subtler ways that you're still not heedful enough.

198
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Yeah, exactly.

199
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,080
Because obviously, if heedfulness is seen thoroughly, developed thoroughly, you'll be

200
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
an unhunt.

201
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,760
The fact that you're not means, okay, so I'm heedful overall.

202
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,680
But within this heedfulness, there are obviously things that still resort to heedlessly.

203
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Yes.

204
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,480
There are not of, you know, core central kind and so on, but are still obstacles.

205
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:27,280
That's why it's hard to do is, the thing is not to, like, to have one particular moment

206
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,800
of insight or something, but to develop this completely, to thoroughly do it.

207
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
It's not only...

208
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Yeah, to keep at it, basically.

209
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
It doesn't matter.

210
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Until it's done.

211
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Until it's done, just, yeah.

212
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:57,480
And one way of staying heedful could be to see where do I seek gratification and see

213
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,360
the danger in those places.

214
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,600
Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.

215
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,760
Because that's why a mind would still be seeking gratification in those places, because you

216
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,360
haven't actually stopped and thought about, wait a minute, but that is dangerous.

217
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,160
That pertains to the same principle that I'm trying to abandon.

218
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,400
That is not for my good.

219
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
That's for my harm.

220
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
That's for the harm of others.

221
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,200
So I should better avoid it.

222
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:37,160
And consider this, it will be easier to recognize it, and then restrain it.
