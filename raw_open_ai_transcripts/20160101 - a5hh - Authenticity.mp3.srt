1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If I was thinking about ordination and certificates of institutions, you never got an ordination based in the human.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not something you need. It's not something to practice. You don't need to find the right to practice.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's an authority to give you the right to mind. It's a certificate.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You could literally, if you were determined in that thinking, well, you could just put on verbs and go and do your thing.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And we'd know whenever I asked you, where you teach. You'd never be reading it in a second.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, it wasn't that in the beginning. I mean, mind you, the ordination and the whole thing we go through that did come from the Buddha. It evolved in that way.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So it's a very thing, but I know which means all of the other kind of politics involved with the Sangha in the Western Thailand Nation.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
All of the politics that now exist and so on, that all came later.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And that's nothing to do with it. But yes, in the early days, remember when the Buddha was just walking around and saying,

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
oh, wow, that Dharma seems really true. Can I follow you? And he said, yes, come here. He would address him, and that would mean he is now part of the order.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's all it took. Because back then, well, it was all about the Dharma, so there was the bond, so to speak. He was clear what the Dharma was.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He was clear what the practice was, so people knew it straight, and there would be enough for them to join and make the effort and become others.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And obviously, in the course of time, over the years, things were getting a bit more complicated. The rules were being made because the monks were breaking, doing all sorts of stuff and so on.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So it evolved to the point, okay, now you need a senior monk, you need a priest, a priest, a priest, a priest, a priest, a priest.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But that's all, again, that's all still relatively simple. But it's also, that's an issue as well, if you think right now, now I'm sort of safe, I am glad to see now.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, that's the thing. I was going to say that the reason why it actually evolved, or rather proliferate, that it's not a form of revolving, proliferate more than that, is exactly that, because now, people don't have the Dharma.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They might find it on the individual level, through their individual efforts. But now, when you come to any order, big, telemedicine, whatever, on an average level, what you hear being told, it's nothing to do, it's very little, well, it's not Dharma, basically.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You might be talking about the Dharma, but listening to it, you won't become an around. Even if you make the effort upon it, it's basically wrong.

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, because of that, there is no that kind of clasing of the Dharma, and that's what the Buddha meant when he said, the Dharma will die 500 years after he's passing away.

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It doesn't mean it would be impossible to become an around later. It means that, when it's being spoken, when it's being referred to, when it's being quoted, it's most likely going to be wrong.

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now, it's going to refer to the wrong thing as the Dharma, but it won't be the Dharma. Obviously, as I said, a person can dig through that and find it on the individual level, but not on the level of community, society, religion, teachers, whatever else.

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So, for that very reason, people, exactly, they need this form of belonging, so they need something more significant to make them feel, well, to feel certain bond with whatever they want to do with his life, so with the whole life, with the older they join it.

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because if somebody just comes off the street and you say, okay, come here, because here is the role. He most likely won't take it seriously, no matter how much he wants to. Why? Because, well, his personal attitude, his personal reasons for practice are not clear to himself.

24
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If, on the other hand, a fully self-transparent authentic person, putugina, comes off the street, there will be enough for him, because he knows the place of it. He knows what he is supposed to do. He knows why he is here for.

25
00:04:39,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, he won't ever need that external, superficial sense of how belong to something bigger or these robes or whatever else. Sometimes can help to people in the beginning, but it's not really essential, because if they don't start clearing up the bad faith internally, they will never really make the proper effort, which means they will never really discover it down, which means they will never ever be the valid,

26
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the right type of connection with it. It will all be maintained by the external circumstances, such as the robes, the rules, the community, you live in, they will keep you together, not the practice of the wisdom that you develop.

27
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Because, on the other hand, he doesn't have to even be a monk anymore, he doesn't have to wear anything, but he will, because that's the lifestyle that corresponds the best to other hardship, which is why he wouldn't create it in such ways.

28
00:05:43,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's a, if you were to actually only pick up, for example, monks who are doing clear reasons without bad faith, relatively authentic, you won't find many.

29
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You won't find many, which means that most of the people rely on the external form to keep you together. And that is a form of silabata paramasa, like you don't see the place of the rules.

30
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You think the virtue is the practice, you think keeping your rules together is the dharma, that's what the practice is, but it isn't.

31
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a prerequisite, it's something that needs to be in place, but it's not the practice.

32
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So, as I said, I said to you, the problem is the past as well, so you have to find out, how can you not keep the rules without breaking them?

33
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Because breaking the rules, again, that's against the practice, for sure, but then holding the rules is also against the practice. So, how can you not break the rules, but then not keep them either?

34
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's how you let your silabata paramasa, let's go, rather put it in the right place.

35
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Because you've got big precepts, the basic fundamentals, basic precepts, but everything else, set up a scene, but everything else is unnecessary.

36
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Eight precepts are the kind of core of it, but what I would always refer to, when you would be talking about the olden times, the wise man of the past, you would always be around the eight precepts, there would be the symbol of virtue and morality established that can lead to wisdom if a person makes the right effort.

37
00:07:47,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The rest of it, as he said himself, on his deathbed, it was after the circumstantial, and he said, you can do away with most of the rules, smaller rules that they have made, they are not. They were after the response to a reason problem.

38
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But, obviously, then I'm not going to forget to ask what those rules were, so then the other hand said, well, let's just keep them, because people will, and they would have criticism right away saying, look, the teacher died, and now they're abolished half of the rules, that's it, the order is done.

39
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But maybe the way you said it now, maybe you said it in a similar way, you could actually abolish most of the rules, maybe there was the kind of rules that you could actually, but it wasn't like, which one should be.

40
00:08:42,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, you're saying, you could, making a point, that's it. Yeah, he could have, actually, yes, I see what you mean, but it's not because the rules were kind of indifferent, they make no difference to the practice of the Dharma, whether you practice it or not, it just makes no difference to it.

41
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Just having them or not, most of those smaller rules we're talking about, having them or not, doesn't make a difference. So, making a big point out of a polishing and really finding out, it's, well, it's a waste of time, and most likely, it might be coming out of something on horse, if somebody's so keen, to get rid of them.

42
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Like in a revolution, I'm going to make a new order or something, it's silly, and it's a waste of time, but yes, in the beginning there were no rules.

43
00:09:36,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then there was one rule, then there were two rules, then there were three rules, and that's how it evolved. And there is, you know, the famous story of that monk who came and said, oh, I just, I wanted to show, I'm not, see, said, I'm not, I'm not unhappy with the Dharma, not anything on that, but there were way too many rules, and I cannot possibly keep, he said, I can't keep all 147 rules, which was funny because now we have 227.

44
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And this monk was complaining, not all of them were yet created, but he said, it's just too much, like, I can't possibly keep that in my mind, I don't want to do it, and he said, okay, well, can you keep three rules then?

45
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't do anything on wholesome by body, by speech or mind, but I think there might be another sort, in this case, he just said, you said, can you just, no, I think I can't imagine, just watch your mind or something like that.

46
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Now this was like, don't do anything on wholesome by body, by speech or by mind, can you do that? Yeah, of course, that's easy, because he knew what unwholesome was, but he couldn't be bothered about the specific, this is how you wear your robe, this is how you put your sitting cloth, you break in the rule, it is ridiculous, in a way.

47
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So that monk had a point, and the Buddha knew that, so he said, well, okay, free enough, some people can see it like that, so can you keep the three rules, and do that?

48
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And that's exactly what refers to, like in the Sutta's Abhidharma, and Abhivina, it refers to that, it's just more, well, more detailed, higher, in a sense, you've surmounted, you've come to the core, the point of every rule is not to do anything on wholesome.

49
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Thus, if you're focused on not doing anything on wholesome, automatically you cannot break the rule, even if actually externally you're putting your sitting cloth wrong, it's not breaking the rule in that way.

50
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So it's breaking the circumstantial irrelevant rule, for which you might be told off, and for which you won't feel anything, because you know it doesn't pertain to anything of significance, which is why you won't have a problem keeping it either.

51
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Making it doesn't make a difference. If some of these people get too wound up, you might want to make a point to them, that is their mistake, but that's more relating to ridiculous co-author stuff that comes with the communities.

52
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But when it comes to rules, it works on that, so you know what's important, and you know there is no compromise there, but then the other rules are just kind of involved in a form of a response to a reason situation for the duration of the Buddha's lifetime.

53
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But technically, and theoretically, you just have to keep the eight reasons, strictly. The stricter you keep then, the sharper you are, the more precise you can get.

54
00:12:40,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And that's it. And like, you know, if sometimes even more or two months, there's this little rule and that little rule. I must not do this, and I can't move the soil, but I can move the soil if it's been disturbed, or it's been at least four weeks before or three months or two months, well the rain is just, it is too complicated, and it's utterly known essential.

55
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So, if on the other hand, you focus on the eight reasons, and you really keep an eye on them, so not even by mind that you're engaging in breaking them, in terms of the unwholesome thought, then even if you go and you take the ground, yeah, externally, it's an offense, and you should confess it, and somebody will tell you off.

56
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But if you know you're breaking that rule, so to speak, you won't do it. You know it's irrelevant, but if you don't do it, there is even no zero ground to be harassed, to be hassled by somebody telling you off, because you shouldn't be doing that.

57
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not really relevant, but you do it or not. It makes no difference.

58
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But there is that element of, well other people don't know that, so they would most likely hassle me, and I don't want to be hassled, why would I be hassled? It's just a distraction, having to deal with other people's issues. So then you just don't do it.

59
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So it seems likely that we don't have any hassles, yeah, but I think that's what people choose to be some areas. It doesn't actually, yeah, it doesn't really...

60
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, it often actually is, yeah, a few people have met, there have been monks, and there were some areas and the monks and some areas, it was usually revolving around that. It was just, they felt it was too restrictive for no significant reasons.

61
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And you can see the point, because it's not just that it's too restrictive from the knife point of view, but it's too restrictive from the cultural point of view. Call what point of view? Like in Sri Lanka, they might not have so much emphasis on call what as they do in the West or Thailand, but certainly it's there. There are things, oh no, that's not proper.

62
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's all, it's often relatively random, depending on what Mantel, what Mantel tells you, it's improper or not, but it's still there. How you should be only groomed like that, or what? But it's there.

63
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So, all of that can actually wind people up, and if somebody's serious with a practice, then yeah, it doesn't make a difference when you summon error or pickle. Well, it doesn't make a difference even if you're a layman, but it's much harder in a layman because wearing the robe is also a form of statement for others.

64
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Basically, it implies a lot, it tells others what you are, so you don't have to explain. If you just turn up as a layman in a group of laypeople, they think you're a layman.

65
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You might be, I don't know, I mean your mind, but they think you're a layman, so they'll treat you like that, they'll expose you to lay things, they'll hassle you with lay things and so on.

66
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
As a monk, they won't, or if they do, they'll at least know that you're not a layman, but then they might choose to know that, but that's a different thing.

67
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So, it is a form of statement, like by wearing the robe, which was also a time in India, they could have, and they didn't, some would have just worn off, but yeah, they would put on any robes and they would immediately stand up.

68
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There's a sad, he's a religious person, he's the seeker of the spiritual life, they often wouldn't know what kind of seeker, what gun, and then they were, who is your teacher, what what teaching do you follow, they wouldn't have a clue, because you couldn't tell.

69
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
They're all racking rags and robes and stuff like that, so it can be anything.

70
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes, the thing is like this, as you say now, you subject to other peoples.

71
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Expectations, yeah, yeah, hassle, whatever else.

72
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, because people stop short when there's a road, and you walk on the corner, you can take the ass off.

73
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And yeah, if you live in an environment where you, it still includes your friends or your family or stuff like that, if you're a layperson, you have to go and hide and talk to the mountain, because otherwise, you know, people would demand things from you, would need things from you.

74
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah, so it's still possible, as it was possible, but as you can be technically an anagami as a layperson, but it's impossible, like it's unbelievably hard.

75
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I mean, it's hard to become an anagami as a monk, let alone as a person, layperson, now they're in the world today.

76
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sure it was hard back in India as well, but I guess their lives were a bit less proliferated than ours, so they were less destruction, less pressure, and so on.

77
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And the mind was also a bit less proliferated, but the point is, where did it go on?

78
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh, I would see what's important is authenticity. Oh, that's the...

79
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:29,000
As it's in, I would say, you know, that's very painful, if you just, it is quite painful, but how do you know it's more painful?

80
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Well, there is no, like a checkpoint that lights up as you pass the level, the sufficient degree of authenticity.

81
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Exactly, like a little beep, letting you know, okay, you're in the clear now, I can take your mom's call.

82
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No, it's not like that.

83
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You know it by various things, and I think it varies from, like, different people would recognize it in a car of different things, but first of all, it's very unpleasant.

84
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So authenticity in itself will not lead you to peace, or becoming authentic, what it does removes all of the unwholesome ways that you have built up in a course of your life to manage or to obscure the fact that your suffering, that existence is unpleasant, that existence is not yours, that it's dreadful, that it's terrifying.

85
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So you use acts of bad faith to cover that up, and then, you know, you can feel it is, you can feel confident, whatever else, whatever habits you have built.

86
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Well, authenticity undoes all of that, so it really exposes you back to just pure, well, often dread, like anxiety, because your entire being is a whole, everything, your sense of self.

87
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You start to feel it is just completely exposed to anything, and you have no control over it yet, you don't know how to stop holding it.

88
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So it's quite a dreadful situation, and that's what authenticity does.

89
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So it's like all of the, the extension philosophy that did talk about it, preach it, practice it himself, could not quite sustain it.

90
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Kierke get up and, you know, he was pellet on his deathbed, he said, he never had a moment piece, moment of peace in his life.

91
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:53,000
From the moment he decided he'd become a philosopher, but he mended in the right, and not kind of theoretical, pondering hegaly and type, but more like genuinely living what he is thinking, what he is preaching.

92
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So he was considered one of the first existentialists for those reasons, so he really made an attitude out of it.

93
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He broke off his engagement, left the woman that he was really in love with, didn't want to accept the position in some, because they were just made him like, well, it would kind of settle him, and it would provide him an illusion of existential safety, which he knew was not right.

94
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Although, every answer he's being wanted to accept it, because everybody gives in to the office of safety, that's how it works.

95
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But he refused, but obviously he was protrusion, so he didn't know the way out.

96
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So he would refuse to give in, which means basically that for the rest of his life he was on the well, on a verge of a breakdown constantly, with facing the existential anxiety and anything else, yet not giving in.

97
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If he would be writing like two or three 500 pages book, 500 pages books per year publishing, you just look at publishing 14, 15, six every year, massive volumes of work, because he was just so intense, and Nietzsche as well, I mean, Nietzsche lost it in the end, he kind of pushed it so far, refused to give in, and went mad as a result of it.

98
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And actually the Buddha did say that, if a person correctly, genuinely authentically starts experiencing suffering, recognizes the nature of suffering, the two outcomes.

99
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Noble search, or mental derangement.

100
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So Nietzsche, by refusing the Christian God, my mad, because he really left no footing for him. Kierkegaard refused to let go of the idea of the eternal God and savior, which made him really funny.

101
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You read this really cute existential description, and then just switches into this God preaching with completely discrepanced stuff, contradictory. So he refused, and that's what actually I think kept him sane, because without having that little bad faith, he would have fully exposed himself to the nature of suffering.

102
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And without the Buddha's help, you cannot, you, you go mad, or you immediately, you know, coming to the Dharma if you've known the research thing.

103
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So that's what authenticity does for you.

104
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But it's just inconceivable to succeed in any way in the Dharma without that as a starting point, because for as long as you're entertaining and holding on to the views and beliefs,

105
00:23:44,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that you have built up as a result of covering up the nature of resistance in a course of your lifetime, you cannot possibly then start applying right view and right things onto it, because you're holding on to the wrong things and wrong views as a form of safety.

106
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And that's why, like, you know, people can, many, people, many monks can know for a fact, openly, they're not even a sort of one, they don't know escape from suffering. Yet, which means they refuse to let go of things that are keeping them put together, but at the same time offering them sense of safety, yet at the same time, they can believe that they are practicing the Dharma, and they're able to teach and preach about it.

107
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So it's after contradiction. If you don't know the way yourself, you can't teach the way yourself. And you don't know the way yourself, because you're refusing to let go of the wrong ways that you have accumulated as a form of, as a form like a buffer zone, as a protection.

108
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So the first thing you will notice by practicing, by becoming authentic, is complete disovenment, so to speak, of your confidence.

109
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The confidence that you've built as a lay person is just completely disobeyed in regard to everything. You feel after exposed in every way.

110
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But then, gradually, if you again don't go mad, don't do anything stupid, don't give up, then the right view can emerge from that, because you're not obstructing it by any holding that is there to delude you to cover things up.

111
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You're not doing that, you're refusing to engage in an act of ignoring, thus a VJ is not being maintained.

112
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So you still don't know that, but that's how your experience is being set up.

113
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So then, by thinking about down a practicing, then you actually start to recognize things that you were talking about, because that is what a VJ is. It's not a metaphysical veil of delusion, Maya, or whatever else, depending on the religion.

114
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's not something that is, to be found, to be discovered in an instant, you turn astonished right there, finally you found it, you was hidden. No, it's the very act.

115
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's the very act of your mind, day in day out, bad faith, ignoring, actively not looking at certain things, actively not acknowledging those things.

116
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Technically speaking, anybody is even vaguely familiar with the sutras, has a vague idea of the Dhamma. If he was to start practicing with intensity, he would naturally go in that direction.

117
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And then even that vague instruction that he came across might be quite sufficient. The more authentic you are, less instruction you need.

118
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The more authentic you are, you understand more. Whatever comes up doesn't, if it's inauthentic, it doesn't stand up for too long.

119
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Well, it doesn't maintain itself. Exactly. As the sutras say, the aggregates, the fire aggregates are being taken up by your assumption, by Upadana, in the same way the fire takes up the fuel.

120
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So the fire burns the fuel, takes this up to be the fuel, and the fuel maintains the fire in return. So the fire, through burning the fuel, spreads over that fuel and keeps burning.

121
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So in the same sense, Upadana and assumption, through maintaining, through engaging in it, it's maintaining itself in regard to your experience as a whole, which is what the fire aggregates are.

122
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So authentic person might be a pitugina, he doesn't know the dhamma, but if he recognizes the validity, the wholesomeness of being authentic, and he starts doing it, he doesn't know yet.

123
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But what he's doing, he's not actually engaging anymore in ignoring, so he's not maintaining hisavidja, he's not maintaining his Upadana, he's not maintaining his craving.

124
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He's exposing it all, and not engaging in it, he can't compress it, like admitting or think, knowing that they are doing something which is based on lust, based on anger.

125
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah, I know it, I'm saying, yeah, that's creating, that's creating. Well, no, you can't. Well, I mean, they can, but that's not authentic, that's the thing.

126
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They're authentic initially on the level of recognition, but they're not authentic on the level of engaging physically in those unwholesome acts, or mentally.

127
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Because, like, as I said, the fact you recognize this is unwholesome, but then you choose to give in, thus you abandon your authenticity right there, and then thinking your authentic while you're engaging in inauthentic acts is a contradiction in terms which means you're inauthentic, which means when you think of yourself as authentic, you're not, because you just gave in.

128
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But, yes, as I said, person can undo a lot of unwholesome things, which are things that maintain, of Asia, maintain craving, perpetuate craving, and so on, even without knowing their nature.

129
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And then, when they do come across the sutras and the dhamma, they need very little instruction, because they've already set everything up correctly, and that's like the famous story of Bahia.

130
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
He was just doing things on his own, wearing the tree bark as he drove him, he thought he was another hunter, and stuff.

131
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And when he met the Buddha, he just gave him a line of instruction, in scene there will be only scene in her, and he was another hunter right there, and then, and be, wow, wow, that was a powerful instruction.

132
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Well, the only reason why that instruction worked is because, although he was wearing a tree bark and doing his own thing, he was actually doing it pretty much rightly.

133
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:31,000
He was authentic to the point of he just needed the one sentence from the Buddha to just slightly tweak whatever understanding he had, and that's it.

134
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And that's what the Buddha meant when he said, some people have little dust in their eyes.

135
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You know, his previous teachers, upon his arrangement, he wanted to go, okay, who should I teach first, then? I said, well, I'll teach my previous teacher with very little, he reached the base of neither perception or perception. So he has very little dust in his eyes, just giving him a sentence or two, and there will be enough for his full enlightenment.

136
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Why? Because actually, reaching the state of neither perception or perception in your contemplation, your understanding, your establishment of mind is quite tall older, and if you can do that, as I said, even a sentence from the Sutras will be more than sufficient for our hunter.

137
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So, if you keep that in your mind in regard to any experience, you go through it and be physical.

138
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So, if you keep that in your mind in regard to any experience, you go through it, be physical or mental, you will, your mind will eventually, well, start experiencing this enchantment with those things, because you just always see them permanence.

139
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Obviously, without the external instruction, without the external pointer of the Sutras, you can't direct that to your self-view, but you can undo pretty much everything else, so when it comes down to undoing your self-view, it won't be that hard.

140
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Self-view is maintained through all of the other wrong views, and it's maintained through the wrong view of itself.

141
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So, you can't abandon self-view, and still hold other views. So, abandoning self-view means you technically undermine all of the other wrong views.

142
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You might still be engaging in sensuality and so on unless you're an Anugami, but the nature of it has been seen, so you just need to develop your mind to the extent necessary that that nature of sensuality doesn't pull you anywhere.

143
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It will show that you can be even an Anugami. It's not that authentic, it's not completely authentic.

144
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Not completely. The 100% authentic person is are out.

145
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It means there is no trace of a visual act in any shape or form or degree, but exactly. So, upon Anugami and Anugami, they all have corresponding degrees of perfect.

146
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So, they're still not quite looking at certain things. They lack certain things.

147
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:42,000
In an authentic book, you want to think of the ultimate authentic view of what it's seen through this.

148
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:57,000
You know, around here, but the way it's seen will be seen in a situation as a whole. It's seen when doing a self-image.

149
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Well, yeah, basically it's seen. Knowing your motive, well, first of all, keeping the precess.

150
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So, not doing anything unwholesome by body, by speech or by mind, in that sense. And then especially, you start by not doing anything unwholesome by body because, no matter how hard you think,

151
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
oh, yeah, I'm being authentic, you're not. Because the domain of a physical action is undermining you. You're not restraining it.

152
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It just simply needs to be restrained, full-stop. Yes, but no, but no, it needs to be restrained. And then afterwards, it becomes apparent why.

153
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That's why Cila comes first. It's not negotiable. So there will be the first step. But once the Cila is in place, then you would start becoming more aware, more mindful of your intentions, of your motivation, why to do this, why to do that.

154
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And that's exactly how you distinguish whether it's wholesome or it's unwholesome. If you were about to do something, why am I about to do it? Why do I want to do it? What's my motivation behind it?

155
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:26,000
As I spoke before, sometimes what's externally, what externally appears as wholesome and great and approved by everybody else, actually can be done for unwholesome reasons.

156
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So that doesn't mean, for example, that the relatively common story of making merit, what people do, because they want something in return, they want the better life for the future.

157
00:35:41,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah, ideally, you don't want to want anything, you just want to give. But if you still do want, that doesn't mean you should stop making merit, because it still counts. But the point is, and also, if you catch yourself wanting a better rebirth, and that's why you give merit, and then you stop giving merit altogether.

158
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Well, that's like overshooting the monk as well, that's wrong too. So what you want to do is be aware of your motivation, and then changing.

159
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You can't stop thinking, so you just have to fully acknowledge the fact that there is a desire for a better rebirth in the future. And by fully acknowledging it, but being fully mindful of it, you'll end up, well, you'll stop acting out of it, because only when you're not mindful of things, do that in the background, as a more general intention that's motivating you, then you'll be in control of it.

160
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You know, when people sometimes, they kind of know why they're doing something, but they refuse to acknowledge to themselves, and then somebody points it out, and it kind of stops them in the shoes.

161
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, it's obvious.

162
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And you know, that's an actor by faith, and that's what you don't want to entertain. So you always keep reviewing your mind as to why am I doing this, why am I doing that, why am I saying this, why don't you want to do this, why am I about to say that?

163
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And if you see something on wholesome, it doesn't mean, okay, I'll stop doing everything now, because that's another act.

164
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Now you're doing out of fear of unwholesome, but acting out of fear is also unwholesome.

165
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So you end up revolving around, you know, panic or whatever else, confusion, doubt, which is all unwholesome.

166
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So you actually, no, you stop and review it. Okay, I want to make merit because I want to be reborn in heaven. Make merit counts.

167
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You just reflect upon the entire situation. Make merit counts, no matter what I want or not.

168
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Obviously, that merit will be greater if I don't act out of two selfish reasons.

169
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So then you still value basically, you still recognize that the act of making merit is valid, whether yourself you should not.

170
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So you don't deny it entirely. But then what you try to do is while making merit or whatever else, just focus on different aspects, because there are other intentions present.

171
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Like here, you want the primary intention is you want to be reborn in heaven, but also you want to help.

172
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Or whatever you give it. Or simply you know that, well, okay, I can't stop wishing to be reborn in heaven.

173
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But what I can do is reflect on the nature of the heaven, and also see that that's something in permanent that will not last forever.

174
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Thus you experience this enchantment in regard to that which you cannot stop wishing for.

175
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And automatically, exactly the pool of your desire towards it stops. It's still a fact that if you give, you will be reborn in heaven eventually as a result of the greatness of your gifts.

176
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So it was nothing to do with you from the beginning. It was just aspects you were focusing on and you're craving taking over.

177
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But if you reflect that even that is in permanent, you stop craving it. You might still want it in a sense. It's factual. It will happen as one of the outcomes.

178
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And that's absolutely fine.

179
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So that's the problem with people when they kind of experience, well, it feels like action paralysis.

180
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:44,000
When you get caught up, like, oh, you see you're about to do something on wholesome or something that comes from the unawesome reason, but it's not necessarily an awesome, but then you just stop doing everything.

181
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You just shut it down, shut it down, nothing, nothing, I'm saying no to everything.

182
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You can't possibly sustain it because as I said, that's an act that comes out of death and also.

183
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So you actually have to be able to allow it to rise and then recognize where it comes from and then affect that, not just throw the baby with the water and everything else.

184
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And that's how you uproot the desire as well, any desire for that matter. When you desire something, well, then you reflect on what you desire on the final goal, the final outcome of that desire.

185
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You reflect on that long enough as impermanent as something that inherently cannot provide satisfaction and automatically your desire fades. But if you directly start to try to tackle your desire, I'm not wishing it, you just end up winding yourself up.

186
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:52,000
More and more, like a dog running title, post running around it and just making the least shorter and shorter.

187
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's a suit of ones that are dear, ones that are dear, you know, king, percent of the other ones, okay.

188
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And what I just said in terms of the desire and what you're just saying in terms of impermanent, yeah, that's basically, that's the difference.

189
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Between thinking the world is the problem and recognizing that actually the problem is your attitude of craving.

190
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Because by default, you don't see your craving, you immediately project, you think the world is a problem. So, ah, the dear ones are caused for suffering. My family is caused for my pain. Friends are caused for suffering.

191
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Attachment is a cause of pain, deny, deny, deny. I will run away, I will abandon everybody, I will not talk to anybody ever again because attachment is a suffering.

192
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But you project it onto the world and you think that by running away, you will abandon the attachment, but you won't, because attachment is actually your attitude.

193
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So, if you stay in the world, or relatively stay in the world, not run away or whatever else, or project out there, then exactly.

194
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But reflecting upon the impermanence, upon the like inherent dissolution of it eventually, you will experience this enchantment and that's the abandoning of attachment, not running away.

195
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That's why, you know, you can have arahants living in the middle of a village. That's why the Buddha didn't. He said, well, let the monks who want to live in caves, let those who want to live in the cities, live in the cities.

196
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:04,000
For as long as it brings them arahansi, or the famous sutra, they are often actually called the bait, the simile of the bait, when people unwarily eat the food and mara lays out for them, the deer herd.

197
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And then the mara does whatever he wants, and then other people see that, other herd sees that, and then they shun the bait completely, run off in the mountain, say no to everything, but they can't sustain that.

198
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So then they come back, and then they have no choice but to eat them early, and then again mara takes control of them.

199
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And then the third deer herd is the one that sees these bones, well, what if we stay in the domain of the bait, but eat it carefully, and then mara can see them.

200
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
They're right there, but they're not catching onto the bait, because you can see only those who grab the bait.

201
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So you're right in the mara's domain, but you can't see them, and that's often in the sutras, and what they said.

202
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The evil one, the unwarily one, can't see me. I'm invisible to them.

203
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Next, to see Ned, because I read that the verse this is, he's telling the woman to reflect, the woman is telling the queen to be fed, she lost her son.

204
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And he came without her permission. What is it to look for? He came from somewhere, you live in another way, without permission.

205
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Right, she will see. Yeah, yeah.

206
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Because having a family, when you see that, will you come to maintain a future family?

207
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well, it becomes actually pointless. You can keep the civil relationship normalised, but internally.

208
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And again, it's different than just saying no, and refusing to have contact with them, and things like that.

209
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Well, that means you're still attached to it, now you're just denying the whole thing, because you can't feel yourself from it. So like that unaware group of that they heard, that saw people being controlled on account of the bait, then they shunned the bait, and they ran away from it.

210
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But then they came back, because they had no choice.

211
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So that's the thing, if you internally experience this enchantment in regard to it externally, you can be very much in the middle of it.

212
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Obviously, there are things that externally you cannot do, like you cannot break the eight reasons.

213
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So just like intentionally, and are out, you cannot intentionally kill, intentionally engage in sexual intercourse, intentionally steal, or lie, or things like that, you can't do that.

214
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So the certain are wholesome things, and external manifestations of them are entirely gone.

215
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But everything else, like, which is why, often, Iran's are not being recognised externally by others, including other Iran's sometimes.

216
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah, see that, this is the dumbest one, who is the first person coming from Iran.

217
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Because I want to be known, because I want this person, she's to be known, basically.

218
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Well, that's fundamentally speaking, but where he wants it or not, makes no difference.

219
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:58,000
But once you experience this enchantment, you won't have a problem talking about it, because it's not, it's easy to be talking about myself.

220
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So externally, again, people can think, oh, he's following himself. Like the first thing the Buddha said upon his enlightenment, when he was walking on the road, when that man met him and says, oh, your senses are clear and bright, you look peaceful.

221
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Who's teaching, did you follow, to reach that peace and clarity? And the Buddha said, I don't follow any of these things, I'm my only, I'm my own teacher, I've enlightened myself, I'm the greatest in the world. And this man says, bright, so be it, friend, and walks off.

222
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
He thought, like, good, go, he's just following himself. And I'm not going to talk to him and left him.

223
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And the Buddha was not wrong in saying, anyway, because he is the greatest in the world. But again, if you say that to Pathujana, to somebody who's not free from the self-view, they cannot possibly not take it in a conceited sense.

224
00:47:48,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Which is why the universe, when sister was gearing the letters, only later realized the true meaning of Anatimani, non-conceit, because she thought Nyanavira was following himself and she really had a go at him, trying to really challenging. But when she failed and then come to see the reason, together with you, then she realized, no, actually it was truly humble.

225
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But again, you read that externally, you couldn't tell if you wouldn't know, if you wouldn't yourself have a reference point for what the real humility means.

226
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You know, the other sort of when the Buddha, when the woman was, we spoke about the other day, when she was saying to Nanda, how come my uncle and my father were older, they were the same, they were even in different heavens and so on. And the Buddha said, because the different faculties, and then he goes on saying, sometimes a person can externally be pleasing to everybody, to monks, to lay people, just the greatest person.

227
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
They're humblers, the meekers and everything, but he holds onto the wrong views.

228
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Which means basically externally, whatever he is, it's utterly relevant, because the wrong views will take him down, not bringing to the better rebirth in the future.

229
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And then constantly, like opposite of that, your person who is prone to anger, prone to being irritated, prone to last protoversion, externally, you know, people think he's a bit of a prick.

230
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But he has right views, he did develop right views, and because of that he will go out afterwards.

231
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:42,000
He is far from ideal, but he's still, so the external is not the measure, he can be an indicator, but it's far from being a measure.

232
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So that's why, the fewness of the wishes and so on, that's an internal attitude.

233
00:49:48,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But depending on the person's faculties, how bringing, and you know, depending on previous lives and habits, they've been called, like neutral habits that have been cultivated for so long, they might be speaking like a really, really arrogant, whatever.

234
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I know it all, I'm fooling myself, although they might be an aren't, or in a way to become one.

235
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And that's where putujana's authenticity comes in. Like, you shouldn't.

236
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But you know, it's how you should not criticize anything, you should accept everything.

237
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Like, every view you should accept, every view is the right view, that's nonsense, it doesn't work right there.

238
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So you do need to distinguish between right and wrong. But if you're authentic, you'll know, okay, this makes more sense, or this doesn't make so much sense.

239
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So you don't fully dismiss, nor do you fully commit in a sense, you don't forget that you're still a putujana.

240
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So you follow the one that makes more sense, and you keep reflecting upon it and re-evaluating it.

241
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But because you clearly keep in your mind that you're still a putujana, you never fully sharp the door to things being different.

242
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So if sometimes down the line, you now find out that this view was utterly wrong.

243
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You won't have a problem dropping it in an instant and finding a better one, the one that makes more sense.

244
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:30,000
If you re-authentic though, you will have a big problem out of it, which is why you get 40-50 vast agents.

245
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And if their view gets challenged, it's just the entire existence is being kind of trembling.

246
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Why? Because they shut the doors very early and went down the wrong lane too far to be able to come back.

247
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So it's not optional anymore. And that's what you don't want to happen to you, or to anybody else.

248
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So you have to keep being authentic and then exactly that.

249
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And then when you think you're right, well, test it.

250
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:11,000
As I told you before, when I started reading philosophy and downwind the suitors,

251
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:20,000
being in nothingness made quite a big impact on me, it's option.

252
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It was quite insightful and, well, a revelation. I read it, I think, six or seven times.

253
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Then I found in the video, starting in the video that made it even more sense,

254
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
because it was like an existential philosophy attitude about the suitors.

255
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It was exactly like, oh, the missing link and so on. So I was really going into that.

256
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And then, finally on the video, a lot of the influence by Sartre and his writing,

257
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and even his way of writing was similar, which was great for me, because I was already very familiar with it.

258
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But then he kept saying, well, it's like, in reference to this or that, how Sartre is wrong.

259
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
He or Sartre is wrong there. And I couldn't see it.

260
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I couldn't see how Sartre is wrong. So for me, I could have deluded myself and said,

261
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
well, in the video there's no one. Because I saw what Sartre meant, and I thought that was right.

262
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But now in the video says what Sartre meant here is wrong.

263
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And I could have deluded myself and said, well, in the video there's no one.

264
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
He's talking about his following self. If I was too afraid to abandon my views, but I wasn't.

265
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So then I kept reading in the video, but then I was becoming afraid to read being in nothingness

266
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
or to find any reference or Sartre, because in my mind, I felt like I'm gaining understanding

267
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
of what Nyanavira is saying. But then if I were to go back and read Sartre's work,

268
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
and if I would still feel him right, that would be a contradiction in terms.

269
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Because I can't have both Nyanavira right and Sartre right, because Nyanavira said Sartre is wrong.

270
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So if I fully understand both, I'll see how Nyanavira is right and I'll see how Sartre was wrong.

271
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And lots of people are actually afraid to do that.

272
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
They're afraid to undermine their own views, which means they're afraid to upgrade them.

273
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Because upgrade is a formula change, and they're afraid to do that.

274
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So for a while, I was afraid, but I kept going with Nyanavira.

275
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But I couldn't, you know, I wouldn't open anything with Sartre.

276
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I had to hold 12 stack collection, my mother brought me from Serbia, that I bought ages ago, all of his works.

277
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And then I remember once I was like, well, you know, there's no postponing.

278
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I really have to see where I'm at, and I opened the Transcendence of Ego.

279
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
He's kind of short of work, which I remember.

280
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
He was so, like, quite a revelation for me to read the whole thing.

281
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So like, wow, I curated it out.

282
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And I was afraid I won't see his wrong views there.

283
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Fortunately enough, like, first second paragraph, it became, oh, of course, yeah.

284
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Which means, yeah, I did actually understand Nyanavira at that point sufficiently enough to see how Sartre was wrong.

285
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Which was clearly a measure of progress for me.

286
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So then I just kept going.

287
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And that also means that you cease to be afraid from any challenge of any other view.

288
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So then I would go to a library and pick up.

289
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Well, I would pick up knowingly stuff that are wrong views.

290
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Like all the nonsense they have in the West, in the libraries.

291
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,000
All the new age books and then, you know, the asset had gurus from India or whatever else.

292
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I wouldn't bother with that because there's two plainly wrong.

293
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But then the stuff that was kind of borderline, I would get that and read it and try to see,

294
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
not just all this is wrong, because I don't like him and I know what he got up to or whatever else.

295
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
No. I had to read the views. I had to understand the views.

296
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And I had to see how and where they were wrong.

297
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And I had the similar thing when I was reading some in a polysuita,

298
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
the fruits of the ascetic life in Indian and Kaya.

299
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,000
When the Buddha lists the six main kind of basis or the wrong view.

300
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
When people think there's nobody killed and you can go and just chop everybody's head off

301
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
along the east side of Genji and this side of Genji's.

302
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Nobody ever dies for just elements.

303
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
First time I read that, to me felt every of those views felt right.

304
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Because yeah, there is no self, there is no good in reality.

305
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
There is, I was a layman back then, 18, 19 years old.

306
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Yeah, but then as I read it, I thought the Buddha is just listing these great views.

307
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But then he says, all these views are wrong.

308
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Oh my goodness, I just stole their all right.

309
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I don't see how they are wrong.

310
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But again, I could have just turned a blind eye to it or I could have made the effort

311
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and see exactly why they are wrong, which is what I've done.

312
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And that's exactly what he talks.

313
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
You should interrogate, investigate, re-evaluate.

314
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
That's what the practice is.

315
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Not like sitting and staring at the floor or nodding your head down

316
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and watching your breath until you fall asleep.

317
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
No, he's like full on active.

318
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And even if you are into samadhi, if you are a samadhi type,

319
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
when people often used to disregard not making, like,

320
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
to justify not making the effort to understand the sutra,

321
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
oh, I'm a samadhi type.

322
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Now, only if you're an arahant, you can say whether you're a samadhi type

323
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
or repassana type, not before that.

324
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So even if you go to sit and meditate,

325
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
you should be developing the right views,

326
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
not like not doing anything.

327
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And that's what the practice is.

328
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
That constant drilling, uprooting, abandoning, upgrading,

329
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
whatever else.

330
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Whatever it takes until you're very knowledge,

331
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
not a chance, not a circumstance,

332
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
nothing given externally to you that can be taken

333
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
until something that you fully developed

334
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and you fully understood by yourself is the result,

335
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
is the cause of you being free from suffering,

336
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
and free from possibility to suffer ever again in the future.

337
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That's what the practice is and that's where it should end.

338
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
That's where it should lead to.

339
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Yes, you need to read the sutras.

340
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
That's when you knew it was such an important book

341
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
because it was that necessary starting point

342
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
just telling you how to start.

343
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I often say to people, well, even if you don't get anything

344
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
more from cleaning the path,

345
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
at least if you get the attitude that you should have

346
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
towards the sutras, that's a good starting point.

347
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Because as I said, yeah, you can have people

348
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
completely disregarding certain parts of the sutras

349
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
they're controlling their views yet to the same time

350
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
they're practicing the sutras, they're practicing the done.

351
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It doesn't work like that.

352
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
If you were to understand something from the sutras,

353
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
you'd be at least a sort of partner.

354
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Thus, if you're not a sort of partner,

355
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
there is no understanding.

356
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
There's no gray area there.

357
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And it's just such an obvious thing,

358
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
but even I needed to hear it from your navela.

359
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
It just doesn't occur to you,

360
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
especially because all the contemporary stuff

361
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
that's out there, that it's telling you otherwise.

362
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But I'm not even, because they're able to keep saying that.

363
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Like when we saw the partner,

364
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and I think, and then you look at the sutras and you do this,

365
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
yeah, it says that,

366
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
but you just never pay attention to it.

367
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Are many occasions?

368
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
There's been a huge loss of attention to the sutras.

369
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah.

370
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Something stand out more than that.

371
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Well, that's become apparent to me in the early days.

372
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
There's not lots of walking meditation and contemplating things.

373
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And I realize, well, hold on.

374
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I am contemplating the navela.

375
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
But what makes me think that the tools that are used for contemplation,

376
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
the basic concepts that are used for contemplation,

377
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
what makes me think that that's right?

378
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
How do I know that?

379
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You just assume that the tools they were given to you were right,

380
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and then you just start working with them.

381
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But hold on.

382
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
What if they're not right?

383
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It means the outcome that you make with those tools will never be right either.

384
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And the tools I'm referring to are these basic concepts,

385
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
such as consciousness, perception, feeling, intentionality.

386
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
And it became apparent to me that, well, hold on.

387
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You'll get Phoenicians.

388
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Exactly.

389
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
What I, in 2017 years,

390
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
what I have developed,

391
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
what I've kind of gathered,

392
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
consciousness to mean,

393
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
well, how do I put to you now?

394
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Which means, my understanding of what consciousness is,

395
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
is put to you, which means there is no understanding.

396
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And there was in the early days,

397
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and I realized that, okay, so actually it's not about finding.

398
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It's just undoing stuff that you already have.

399
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Because what you have, you got it wrongly.

400
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So then I switched and started doing my walk-in meditation.

401
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I was in the heart, I'm in a little room.

402
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
There were four or five steps, one way or the other way, one way diagonally.

403
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
From wall to wall, but it was enough to keep me going.

404
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And I kept doing it there,

405
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
and then I just, I would literally just take up,

406
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I was still on the garlic.

407
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Take up consciousness.

408
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And just keep thinking what consciousness is.

409
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And I don't mean referring to, you know,

410
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
some literature, psychological descriptions,

411
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
nonsense, whatever else.

412
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But just generally, okay,

413
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I say consciousness out loud right now.

414
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
What does that stand for right now in my experience?

415
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It needs to stand for something.

416
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Otherwise, you couldn't be able to say it.

417
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So you can do that in regard to everything.

418
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But you want to bring it down to the most general,

419
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
most fundamental terms,

420
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
the five aggregates,

421
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
matter, feeling, perception,

422
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
tensionality, and consciousness.

423
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So then you start thinking like that,

424
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and you realize it's not about building things,

425
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
not even bothering with the tool,

426
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
just undoing that which I thought of tools,

427
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
because all of that was taken for granted.

428
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And that was already the problem.

429
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So you undo that, that's all you have to do.

430
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's not that you have to undo the wrong tools

431
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
and then build the right thing.

432
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:35,000
No, I'm doing that means building the right thing.
