WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
But in a sense, basically, his strength was in the eye of the entire domain of the senses,

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
not just in a risk of his strength in regard to the unholy, in regard to sensual.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
So it was like the similar debate that Sutta, where you completely shunned it.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
You shun everything. You see the danger, but you can't stay within it in a careful manner.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
So you run away, you can't be through the whole thing in a way.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
And sooner or later, you have to come back to it.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
That's like a people, like, it is strength, super-extraint.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
And then just puff, give in, and then the damn breaks, and then just create worse mess than before.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
So it's kind of oscillating, but there is no strength.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
And in that talk, when I said, you know, like, say, like your senses, say a visual sense,

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
like a wild dog, they want to pull you out.

00:58.000 --> 01:07.000
So sometimes, okay, by default, you resist the pull, but sometimes you can constantly be resisting the pull,

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
because it will weigh you down.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
So then you have to pick your back out, whereby you resist the pull that is clearly unholy.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
There is no negotiation there.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
However, if that wild dog is pulling you through something that is neutral,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
you have to be careful to let, like, not resist that.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Because it's easy to give in, and then no.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I said, no, to everything.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
It's like what monks usually do, when they, or then, or something, they come,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
and that's when they become neurotic.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
No, no, no, Vinaya, Vinaya actually says the opposite.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Yes, but still.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
No, no, no, but still, you have to allow for that space in between.

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
Like, the whole thing that we spoke before, like, putting the cloth down in women, which is actually not properly receiving the food.

01:54.000 --> 02:03.000
And you can exactly see how it originated, was from a woman who might accidentally brush against your fingers when you were receiving it.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
Nothing to do with you, and Vinaya says clearly, if that thing happens, it's not an offense.

02:09.000 --> 02:19.000
But obviously, you know, a doubtful mind, well, a mind that is not developed in regard to doubt, will be overwhelmed by that doubt eventually.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
So then you know, they really haven't done anything wrong.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
The Vinaya says they haven't done anything wrong.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
It was unintentional.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
But you can't sleep at night.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Because basically you're caught in this neurotic kind of doubting paranoid sort of, whatever.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Spiling out of control.

02:34.000 --> 02:43.000
So then what you do, then you make an exercise and you create your own rule, and to prevent even that from happening.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
So no, I'll put a cloth down.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I'll put a cloth.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
So then the woman can't touch me when she enters.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, but being touched, except it's not a problem.

02:50.000 --> 03:00.000
So if that is bothering you, you should deal with that on that phenomenological level, not like of a level of running away and imposing another rule on top of a rule.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And that rule is unnecessary.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
More certainly, like it can be irrelevant, sure.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah, you use a cloth or whatever.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
But like in this case, for example, it actually goes against the Vinaya rule.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
So because you're a neurosis, Vinaya became inadequate for you and you need more.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
And that is exactly what happens in most of the core work.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
In the sense of seeing a wild dog that's pulling me out, that's not a problem.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
The problem is when he ends up in an unwholesome state and then I have to suffer and I can't do it.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
It's still the same wild dog.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Never was mine, never can be mine.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
So then you just basically foresee the unwholesome scenarios where that dog will go and you prevent that and then let it go.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
And then the dog will eventually come down as well.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
But you mustn't go around just saying no to everything you see, everything you hear, everything you might doubt because you might doubt everything.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Because that's going to be a very tight and unpleasant state.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
And it is always.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
It's an exception.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
So people do suffer and can't do it. And then even you say you have to avoid unwholesome.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Don't necessarily worry about wholesome.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
It's quite hard for them to allow that because everyone means taking up responsibility for the distinction.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
Okay, so now I have to rely on my own criteria that this is unwholesome and this is wholesome.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
There is no external authority, there is an external community, external ministry, external Vinaya, external debt.

04:26.000 --> 04:36.000
That's kind of beforehand, but now I actually need to draw a line between good and between the bad and then stay behind that line.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
And that's basically very hard thing to do.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
But if a person does that, then they truly go beyond silver bath parmasks and silver bath parmasks as I'm sure I said before.

04:46.000 --> 04:56.000
It's somewhat people come and think, right, it's a ritual to ridicule it, bowing to a gold-gilded shrine or something. No, it's holding to a virtue and duty.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
And that isn't quite a serious thing.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
As things that will actually free you.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Exactly. As things that they find themselves.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Directly resulting in liberating material.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Basically, you believe that your virtue and duty are directly easy to demand.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
You want? It doesn't.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
You couldn't.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
It can enable you to draw a line. The line I was talking about.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
And when you draw that line, then virtue and duty, as you have adopted before and it had to be there where you have adopted before and.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
But once you draw a line, once you go to the criteria for that line, it falls away as virtue, as duty.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
That's why he is beyond silver, so to plan and then eventually around.

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
That's why it's hard for people to draw that line because it relies on their own judgment.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
There is no safety of tradition, safety of the history, the order of everything.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
It's just you, basically, sticking behind what you chose to do.

05:56.000 --> 06:11.000
Obviously, you won't be able to wholesome me or rather rightly draw that line. If you haven't been adopting even externally these rights and rituals or are the virtue and duty, the norms.

06:11.000 --> 06:24.000
But you must certainly not stay there because then, yeah, then you would be like, you know, a 50, 50 last month who is still as neurotic about his rule as on the first day and still not in the sort of manner.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
But there's clearly going beyond sealer means going deeper.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah, going beyond sealer means basically not depending on it, but not breaking it either.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
What being unable to break it, to an extent, obviously.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Because, you know, that sealer is also defined in regard to, where else is sealer?

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
I mean, like, all the necessary little, all the little circumstantial denial rules.

06:47.000 --> 06:58.000
I talk about the basic principle of, you know, solubacy, lying, stealing, things that are in themselves and wholesome.

06:58.000 --> 07:09.000
So that is the important bit because obviously, you know, virtue is important, but then people take it and then, even after, you know,

07:09.000 --> 07:18.000
the knowledge they might have gained to suit us or whatever, they're still unable to let go because they don't know the truth or are they feared if they let go,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I mean, they were the opposite of non-sealer.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
And that can happen if that sealer hasn't been established beforehand.

07:25.000 --> 07:38.000
So there is actually, you have to, basically, it's like building up a ship, developing sales, you know, gathering all the information about the design and engineering it and then doing the whole thing,

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
never putting it into water and trying it out, never, never like setting it to go to see if it's going to sink.

07:47.000 --> 07:56.000
So start singing quickly, pull it back, repair it, but you have to cross the other shore, not remain on this, clutching onto your little boat.

07:56.000 --> 08:05.000
Because what's the use of the boat, if you don't actually use it to sail away, into the same thing.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
So in terms of the food, that's like the, that's a quite good idea.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
You've seen that yourself, probably experienced it yourself in the monasteries, how people like, like, so, okay, I have to eat.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
So it's not like, you know, sexual intercourse or other unwholesome things that you don't have to do, you shouldn't.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
But the food I have to eat, and then, obviously, you always have preferences.

08:31.000 --> 08:39.000
Like, the mouth, your tongue, the sense of taste as an independent animal is an independent animal.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
It prefers things, it wants things, it doesn't want certain other things.

08:43.000 --> 08:51.000
And that is kind of evolved, completely circumstantially.

08:51.000 --> 09:01.000
Based on the stuff you, when you were eating, you developed taste for certain things, you got sick of some other taste, that's it.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
But obviously, for good to general, it's inseparable from the sense of self.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
So then when someone says, okay, you need to eat carefully.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
The other side you have to eat, but you have to eat carefully.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Like, it's your last, you know, kid your child, you need it just for survival.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
So, yeah, that is true.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
That's what you need to have. I eat food purely so this body will still be alive so that I can practice.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
But over there, as it said, you need to be obsessed with a bunch of preferences.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Or, certainly, try to avoid it.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
So you have people who get so mind-up, neurotic about eating food that they like.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Because I can't be mindful, basically, if the food I'm eating is the food I like.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
It's impossible. But actually, it isn't.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Mindfulness is nothing to do with whether what you're eating is what you prefer or what you don't prefer.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
Mindfulness is actually indifferent to your preference, which is why it's the mindfulness that needs to be practiced.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It's not just the opposite preference.

09:58.000 --> 10:07.000
Because I remember I met people who would just intentionally take opposite of what they really want to take.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
And it's like, well, the whole purpose of that is only to avoid responsibility for what you've taken.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
There's no mindfulness involved.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
So just you feel responsible if you take what you want to take.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
So you think you avoid that responsibility by then taking what you don't want to take.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
But you don't see that you're responsible for that now.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
Because you can't avoid your responsibility by choosing a particular choice.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
So you realize, why did I choose correctly for or what I don't?

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
I am affected by the at-choice of choosing food.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Even if I write down an impersonal algorithm that calculates for me what number of dishes to take on one day,

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
I have basically chosen the algorithm to be that which can give me the food to eat.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
That's absolutely responsible for it.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
Either way, when you rely on an external thing, an external, like an algorithm, or external written law,

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
or somebody who has said, externally said, you will not be aware internally of your responsibility for your choices,

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
which means you won't be mindful properly.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
So then you realize, you don't actually have to fear your preferences.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
You have to fear losing mindfulness in regard to that.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Or in regard to anything.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
That's when that issue is set in.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
That's when a video gets rekindled and so on.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Not when you eat your favorite fruit.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Because I want to get rid of my attachment towards fruit.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Exactly.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
But they identify their attachment with their preference.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But it's not preference is a preference of your taste.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
And your taste is not yours actually.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
That animal is independent of you.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Always dragging around for so long, then you just,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
but you're inseparable from it in your mind.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
But even then, your preference is not your attachment.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
It's ignorance.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
In regard to preferences, then you're attached right there.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
And that's the thing, because people in the course of their life

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
got so used to eating food that you prefer means eating it unmindfully,

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
are rarely lustfully.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Thus, now preference means that.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
So I must avoid preference.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
I must deny.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
I must stop eating altogether as I were up into two giants.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
You could see the revolt, the rebellion of the mind against the preference

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
or the choice.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
But the white completely opposite way within the same domain of choice.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
So then they just started choosing the opposite.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
And more and more bizarre.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
So, oh, I will eat every second day.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
No.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Then I will eat every third day.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
When that becomes not enough, I will eat every third day

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
from every fourth person,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
on every third junction of the second town.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
It's just completely randomly balanced.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
And only rice.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And only rice.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
And then when that basically sees to induce novelty of the restraint.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And you finally just told us before.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Exactly what you do.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Then you just go further.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
And then I will stop eating all together.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
And that's the highest demand.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
It's not.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
You never was.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
And that's what the Buddha said.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
He was slightly in a different relation.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
The different question.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
When he asked me, why do you think that my disciples respect me?

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
He said, well, because you eat little and you praise it in little.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
You live under a tree.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
He said, no, that's not true.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
I sometimes eat a bowl full of food up to the brim of the back.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
It's soft.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
It's nice.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And then I have another bowl full of food.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
So he had two arms, both.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
So he finishes with four arms, both of food.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And then they ask him, oh Lord, enjoy.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
He said, yeah, sure.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Fill it up again.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
And he eats it.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
And while at the same time he has disciples who get food every second day or something.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And it's a very coarse and horrible food.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And they live to cover you like a hemp throbes and under element of tree.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
So if they were to respect him on a kind of...

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
With nothing behavior, they wouldn't.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Yet they had the utmost respect for it.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Why?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Because the devil is...

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Well, it's it beyond that as well.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
And they know it.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
And they know it because of his teaching thus, the respect is unshakable.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
Even if the Buddha just spends the rest of his days living in King's Palace as an eating all the time.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Makes no difference.

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
Because if you're trying to adjust your food to adjust your mind.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
You're taking it from the wrong end.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Yeah, taking it from the wrong end.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You're trying to solve the problem from the wrong end.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Or just mix your food in the bowl.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I told you I was doing that because people were talking about it.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
And I didn't mind to begin with it.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
But I did find it quite amusing.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I did it on the second day of mixing everything.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Fish, fruit yogurt, grapes and stuff.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I started developing tastes for certain mixes.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
I started to like fish with grapes.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
Or with my mouth, it's full of all sorts of fruit, curry, rice and ice cream.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Whatever was melted over.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
My mind, again, if you eat it mindfully, if you relax.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
You might get focused on the pit of the mouth.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
That is in contact with the taste that you like.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
So there is no end to that separation of your preference.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Well, not preference of choice, basically.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Of what you want, what you like.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Because you can't do that mechanically.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Because the mind, in the sense, will always pick on that.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Even if you give it.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And then if you just eat what you don't want.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Within that, you'll start preferring things.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Like, what should this life less?

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
So there's completely from the wrong end.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
What you need to do is eat mindfully whatever comes your way.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
So then, if you do need a criteria for, okay, but still, what should I eat?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Because you know, I'm in a shop as a layman, perhaps,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
who keeps the free subs.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I mean, I'm in a supermarket.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I don't want to buy.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
So what criteria?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
You use criteria, okay, why do you eat?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Why would I say it should be?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
To be healthy.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
So you can practice.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
So then, choose the healthy food.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
So there is really horrible tasting healthy food.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And there is something I really crave about.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
Well, either way, choose what's cheaper.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Or choose something in between.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Or choose what you like for making a point

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
to not lose the mindfulness while you're eating that which you like.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Because if your mindfulness becomes unshakable

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
in regard to a harmless preference of foods,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
it's nothing unwholesome about preferring a watermelon

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
or a mango is a step preference.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
That does not induce lust.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
It's ignorance in regard to it.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
It's ignorance in regard to the preferred object

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
that provides you with pleasure.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
That's what induces lust.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
But beautiful objects, tasty objects,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
nice sounds.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
One of that is actual lust, and it was quite clear on that.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
So choose whatever you want to choose for whatever reasons

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
because that's beside the point.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
The point is eat it mindfully when you eat it

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and be mindful of the feeling of eating it.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And never compromise with that.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
So soon enough, you won't take long

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
if you really commit to that sort of practice.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
You will basically just not care what you eat.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Because you realize there was never a point.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Or like never, never that relates to the problem.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It was mindfulness in regard to it.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It was basically appropriating the domain of the taste

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
when you're following the food.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Like, entertaining the notion

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
that you are actually consuming that food.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
But when that food disappears down on your throat

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
when you swallow it, it's in you.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
But it's not that food.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
When it's in your stomach, it's as external as it was

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
when it was out on the shelf in the shop.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Which means your stomach, then,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
cannot be appropriated.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
It means the whole domain of your body, then, remains external to you.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
And that's what your mindfulness gets established upon.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
And that means you basically just stepped outside

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
of the whole domain of centrality.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
The centrality, the domain, whereby pleasure,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
that pertains to senses, can pull you.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
But being by stepping outside, they can't pull you anymore.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
So the whole of preference is remained.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
But none of them is used any last anymore.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Why? Because you're not there.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
You can't be affected by it.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
There is mindfulness of that situation.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Yeah, well, having your mindfulness established,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
having your mind composed, in regard to that,

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
well, in regard to the right extent of that phenomenon

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
of the body, this body here and now.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Because most people think, like, you know,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I mean, your skin is inside.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
And, you know, your lungs are inside,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
your stomach is your mouth is kind of inside.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
And then inside inevitably has that, like, personal connotations.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
It's, like, in a mind.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
And that's why, for an art hand, that kind of internal

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
disappears.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
So to speak, something that's used in suit

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
is different internal external.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
But when the Buddha says, what is left,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
it's this conscious body.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I out there, this conscious lamp of flesh

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
in the world, externally.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
And the naming matter, external.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
So whichever way he looks,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
internally externally, basically, he sees external

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
and slightly less external, but still external,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I, not mine.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
That's what I mean by internally,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
and it needs to be clarified.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Because internally is taken as my internal dear.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Suffering arises, like, you know, the true dukkha.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
The pure dukkha arises internally.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
In that, like, sense of mind,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
you're affected by it.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah, exactly.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
The mind, as it goes, is inside.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
And you're able, well, okay,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
it's inside in relation to what you see from your senses,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
but all of it, as a whole, it's outside.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
And here, yonder, yonder,

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
and here, as in inside, are all out there.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Here's also sort of strange practices

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
up here.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Well, the yeast, we've tried to get, you know,

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
the suffering of God's food,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
regard to your desires,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
and so you create a new food.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
You blame the food, or you,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
you basically, you're so caught up,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
in the desire around the food,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
you end up just thinking about food all the time.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah, trying to get beyond,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
denying food, trying to replace the food.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah, something else.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
And one thing that some people like to

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
replace with is breathing,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
breath aerials.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Well, I have a bone there.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Yes, that's another interesting.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Well, what's the difference then?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Because then, will you just take your breath?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
As personal mind, you can't.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And you depend on it.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You have, there is, the body is dependent on a nutrient.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And do you, to say that it's a game?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
It's an illusion.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Right.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Well, no, that doesn't make sense.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
It's an illusion.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And then, but breathing just air to nourish the body.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Maybe some people can get better at the game.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
But that's what, that's what I mean.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Why would you stop there then?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
If you deny food, why don't you start denying breath?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Which is what people did.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Which is what the Buddha tried to do.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Yes, stop breathing.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
And then you realize, no, this is a completely wrong way.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
You will never reach,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
well, freedom and liberation by doing that.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
So what do you think? You know, imagine.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
I mean, imagine the hardcore ascetic

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
on a brink of death all the time, basically.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Has already, you know,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
his close friends in the world were the same.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
And at the same rate.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And then he goes off and eats this milk rice

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
given to him by a woman.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Just, and he eats this bowl of

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
probably quite delicious, basically healthy, fatty milk rice

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
and they sing dirty.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And it's over.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
What's he took two oranges?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Where is your restraint?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
He ate the milk rice

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
as a form ascetic.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And he realized, actually, you know,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
it's going to be waste of time.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
You have to go the other way.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Yeah, because it's not waste of time.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
No, not waste of time.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
He's just like a reaction in regard to it.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
And that's what it's,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
a similar debate,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
imagine an entire debate.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And that's what it's done.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
That's what it says.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
The first, basically,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
traps and controls by Mara.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
He doesn't understand some.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Other, we'll actually see that.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And they were like, oh, look, Mara is actually there.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
And he traps people.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
And that is bad.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
So what they do,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
they debate completely,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
deny it, and they run away from it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Into the mind.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
When there is no debate,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
there is no Mara, there is nothing.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Because, basically, if you don't eat food,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
you will not be bothered by preferences,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
and you go to food.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
So just throw the whole thing.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
But you can't sustain that.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
And the Buddha himself said that so many times.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Which means, then,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
that hurt eventually,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
when there isn't anything left in those margins,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
where the debate is set, and they, again,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
eat in amwarely, and on account of that,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Mara does what he wants.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Then the third, the third,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
sees the first group, sees the second group,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
and then realizes, well,

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
what if we stay within the debate?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
But he didn't worry.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And then, always,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
we'll step ahead and say, well,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
then they start arguing or reviews.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
They might be living withdrawn from Centralite.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
They start arguing or reviews,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
and they find that, then the fourth era

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
doesn't even argue or reviews.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
But at the principle of Centralite,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
it's basically staying within the debate,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
because you have no choice really.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
And by shunning the debate, you give power to the debate.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
So stay within the debate,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
but never, ever eating it unwarely.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
So, literally, imagine,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
the further rest of your life,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
whatever food you put in your mouth,

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
will have potential to have a hook in it.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
But you have to eat it.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
So every, every most sort of food that comes to you,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
will have a debate hidden inside it

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
for the rest of your life.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Or, have a possibility of having a base.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
You don't quite know. You can only have foods.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
So how would you eat that food?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Very carefully.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
For the rest of your life.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
So you have to put it in your mouth,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
piece by piece,

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
bit by bit. Don't let it all around you.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Don't lose mindfulness.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
It's just bite in it,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
because it will rip your mouth.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And then, oh, there is a debate,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
but you haven't been eating like a maniac,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
carelessly.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
So you can feel it. You can pull it out

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
without actually arming yourself.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
You can eat the rest.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And the further rest of your life,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
in regard to everything you put in your mouth.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
And that's all it says, basically.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And that, that's similar,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
of course, in the desert.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
That's exactly what it says.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
So you really have to eat.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Okay, well, we have to kill this child,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
it's a lie by the way.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
But at least it will give us a chance to survive.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
And maybe have some more children.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
And they may commit this children.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
Whatever it is, it's always best of the horrible scenario.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
So you might quite like that child.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I mean, the taste of it.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
If you start eating.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Yeah, because you need a starving,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
fried meat.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
No, no, no, no.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
You still have to eat it.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
So how do you eat it?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
You need to care for it.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Don't forget it's your only child that you just killed,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
in order to survive.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Which means you won't forget the purpose why you eat it.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Which means you won't get careless.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
And certainly, you want results to food

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
for mere central pleasure.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
You need them.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Then you want a problem eating once a day.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
It's, it's also seen as a food you see.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
A something which will bring,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
will give you some sort of experience.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Oh, I know it's a good experience.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
That's a completely different thing.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I know what you mean.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
But they're just a whole new level of wrong.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
It's not being worth addressing it.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah, it's just that it's such a,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
it's a very common and normal thing

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
for most people.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It's just food is a nice thing.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Yeah.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
And they just enjoy it together.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Yeah.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
They just have this taste.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Yeah.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
But that's, that those are people that don't even have a concept of what the practice will,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
if any kind of this trend would be,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
they're just completely forgotten.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
You know, they're the first hurt.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
It doesn't even recognize that it's actually been trapped.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It's not even completely in control,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
but they don't even recognize it.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
So, nothing you say to them.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
We'll change that and I'll ask them themselves.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
That's it.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Right.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
I mean, for goodness sake, people go as far as to...

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
mystify the food, Christians,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Christians.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Good grief.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I go, you believe, oh yeah, this, this,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
this fried up

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
loaf of bread, whatever I'm eating,

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
I was given to it.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I go, directly, by God.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
This is the, the gods.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Paul, they are meeting.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Increation, through devotion,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
if I remember correctly, it's been ages ago.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
When I, when I had a friend,

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
in Krishna, with God for his lunches.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Yeah, we were going there for the food, really.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
This is a nice food.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
And he was a nice guy.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
But I was really interested in whatever he's saying.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
So, he just put up with it.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
So, you can eat.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
But, I don't remember.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
I remember basically the whole, the whole idea was

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
this, this, like, the more you eat,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
the more of a, like, a, a, a, a, a,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
a, a, a, a, a, a,

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
a, a, a, a, a, a,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

27:53.000 --> 27:53.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a

27:53.000 --> 28:02.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

28:02.000 --> 28:02.000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, aIf

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
da, a Aboriginalphot,

28:08.000 --> 28:01.000
a, a, l, a, a, a,

28:01.000 --> 28:10.620
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

28:10.620 --> 28:12.620
Supplements, that's not a issue.

28:12.620 --> 28:16.620
Only if you think this may be, you'll be, you know, you have last full thoughts.

28:16.620 --> 28:20.620
Well, you have last full thoughts, because you have last full body.

28:20.620 --> 28:23.620
I think this may be my reminder of that.

28:23.620 --> 28:27.620
And if you're not developed, you're regarded, then it may be me.

28:27.620 --> 28:30.620
You just need to have reproductive organs.

28:30.620 --> 28:33.620
That's it.

28:33.620 --> 28:37.620
So, yeah, blaming the specific food, you know, don't need those foods.

28:37.620 --> 28:40.620
I mean, I'm not talking from the health perspective.

28:40.620 --> 28:42.620
I'm talking from the spiritual perspective.

28:42.620 --> 28:45.620
And for those people, you know, that's why I often spit it out.

28:45.620 --> 28:47.620
It is linked with health.

28:47.620 --> 28:49.620
With yogis or whatever else.

28:49.620 --> 28:51.620
You know, I help the food, my spirit is helpful.

28:51.620 --> 28:52.620
Good luck with that.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.620
What you're going to do when your body gets sick, because it's all right.

28:55.620 --> 28:58.620
And you hold your whole life a spiritual development.

28:58.620 --> 29:00.620
And bodily pushes and stuff.

29:00.620 --> 29:01.620
Gone.

29:01.620 --> 29:05.620
All your attainment is dependent on your healthy body.

29:05.620 --> 29:10.620
Yeah, and that's not an attainment.

29:10.620 --> 29:12.620
And that's my favourite one.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.620
Not even that.

29:14.620 --> 29:18.620
Not even people who are right, young.

29:18.620 --> 29:19.620
Yeah.

29:19.620 --> 29:20.620
So...

29:20.620 --> 29:22.620
No, it's a completely misplacement.

29:22.620 --> 29:26.620
And it's easy, easy for people to do, because obviously...

29:26.620 --> 29:30.620
The pure number, the real number is that it's so hard, subtle to understand.

29:30.620 --> 29:32.620
I mean, do you see how many people could just travel,

29:32.620 --> 29:36.620
cross the idea of being mindful of an arisen thing?

29:36.620 --> 29:40.620
Like, without resorting to some sort of, you know, scientific explanation,

29:40.620 --> 29:43.620
or say, I was constantly, you know, just be mindful of an arisen thing.

29:43.620 --> 29:49.620
Be mindful of the enduring arisen thing, arisen thing that endures.

29:49.620 --> 29:52.620
And the confusion is already set.

29:52.620 --> 29:56.620
So if it's the same thing, like five seconds ago, and the thing now,

29:56.620 --> 29:59.620
well, that's not the same, but it is the same thing.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.620
But it isn't, because it was five seconds.

30:01.620 --> 30:02.620
So there is a change.

30:02.620 --> 30:03.620
We did that same thing.

30:03.620 --> 30:07.620
But it's still the same thing, because you're still talking about it as a same thing.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.620
That's changing in a different level.

30:09.620 --> 30:11.620
And that's already mind-blowing.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.620
For most of people.

30:13.620 --> 30:16.620
I think that's quite normal back in the day.

30:16.620 --> 30:19.620
That kind of authentic sort of recognition of...

30:19.620 --> 30:21.620
You know, they didn't think they were in time.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.620
They didn't think time was constantly changing.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.620
And everything is in the flux.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.620
They had no notion, such as those.

30:27.620 --> 30:31.620
So the human are done with something's first time, and they were before, even immediately,

30:31.620 --> 30:32.620
land.

30:32.620 --> 30:33.620
It didn't make sense.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.620
Because they didn't have so many wrong reviews coming together.

30:36.620 --> 30:39.620
Now there's other cases.

30:39.620 --> 30:47.620
With food, knowing that, or knowing that the body means nutrient,

30:47.620 --> 30:51.620
and contemplating that, that can be a huge point.

30:51.620 --> 30:53.620
Yeah, depending on the term.

30:53.620 --> 30:57.620
And that's our secondary.

30:57.620 --> 31:02.620
And for your concern should be mindful in regard to the need for the food.

31:02.620 --> 31:07.620
Basically, everything you put in your mouth, as it might have a sharp fish bonnet,

31:07.620 --> 31:12.620
or something that if you buy it will break your tooth.

31:12.620 --> 31:17.620
And you will be unable to eat it carefully.

31:17.620 --> 31:19.620
If you cultivate that actually.

31:19.620 --> 31:24.620
And you will become unable to descend down into your belly as yours.

31:24.620 --> 31:26.620
And regard it as internal need.

31:26.620 --> 31:30.620
Which means you will stop going down into the center of the maze.

31:30.620 --> 31:33.620
Where those pleasures can exercise power is over here.

31:33.620 --> 31:37.620
We say it's more powerful food.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.620
Or sex.

31:39.620 --> 31:45.620
Well, sex would be more powerful.

31:45.620 --> 31:50.620
But food would be more fundamental.

31:50.620 --> 31:53.620
If you're hungry, you won't have thought of sex.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.620
In that sense, food is more fundamental.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.620
But the pool of food, you know, you're hungry.

31:58.620 --> 32:03.620
It will never be as feverish and crazy as pool of sex.

32:03.620 --> 32:10.620
A pool of sex is just a combination of all the pools.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.620
Yeah, exactly.

32:12.620 --> 32:15.620
All of the animals are pulling in.

32:15.620 --> 32:19.620
So all of the senses are intoxicated by the sexual desire.

32:19.620 --> 32:22.620
As you know, in your opinion, you're good to know.

32:22.620 --> 32:26.620
In a single form, then a form of man, the sets of mind of a woman,

32:26.620 --> 32:29.620
and a form of all the sense of mind of a man.

32:29.620 --> 32:32.620
And then those little sights, sounds, mouth, face, touch,

32:32.620 --> 32:35.620
as that of a man for a woman and a woman for a man.

32:35.620 --> 32:40.620
So basically, yeah, you have all five pools going for it.

32:40.620 --> 32:43.620
Food is fundamental, which is why, obviously,

32:43.620 --> 32:46.620
it's completely unnecessary to be done at all,

32:46.620 --> 32:49.620
and it shouldn't be done at all.

32:49.620 --> 32:52.620
While the food you have, you know, you have to eat and engage with it,

32:52.620 --> 32:55.620
but then you have to sort of start separating.

32:55.620 --> 32:59.620
You know, eating the stuff around the bed, not with the bed.

32:59.620 --> 33:02.620
Give yourself to be mindful then of the...

33:02.620 --> 33:03.620
You can't.

33:03.620 --> 33:07.620
There's no mindfulness here to recognize mindfulness

33:07.620 --> 33:11.620
as an arisen, established thing.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.620
It's impossible to have that.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.620
And the sexual desire, what?

33:15.620 --> 33:21.620
Sexual pool that you get, it suggests that you engage at the same time.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.620
And that's what the Buddha meant when he said,

33:23.620 --> 33:25.620
it's impossible to engage in a sexual intercourse

33:25.620 --> 33:29.620
without being held by the central perceptions.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.620
Without your mind being held by that.

33:31.620 --> 33:34.620
It's impossible to not perceive sensuality

33:34.620 --> 33:38.620
and engage in the actual act of sensuality

33:38.620 --> 33:42.620
because that act is defined by the perceived sensuality.

33:42.620 --> 33:43.620
But non-mindfulness.

33:43.620 --> 33:44.620
Well, of course, yeah.

33:44.620 --> 33:45.620
Yeah.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.620
The non-developed mind.

33:47.620 --> 33:48.620
Yeah.

33:48.620 --> 33:51.620
So you can know, you could try,

33:51.620 --> 33:55.620
I mean, obviously, persons having sex,

33:55.620 --> 33:59.620
they can really be in a present moment.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.620
Well, you're always in a present moment.

34:01.620 --> 34:02.620
You're always in a present moment?

34:02.620 --> 34:05.620
With it, but it means nothing.

34:05.620 --> 34:07.620
They don't even know what a present moment is there.

34:07.620 --> 34:08.620
Yeah.

34:08.620 --> 34:10.620
Which is when people practice being in the present moment.

34:10.620 --> 34:12.620
Just going with it.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.620
There's nothing wrong with being in the past moment.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.620
The future moment.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.620
But what if you're mindful of it?

34:20.620 --> 34:23.620
The person who enables you strengthen your mind

34:23.620 --> 34:24.620
with mindfulness,

34:24.620 --> 34:27.620
or, let's say, strengthen your mind.

34:27.620 --> 34:30.620
You have a mindfulness.

34:30.620 --> 34:33.620
And you've got food.

34:33.620 --> 34:34.620
There will...

34:34.620 --> 34:35.620
Well, sexual...

34:35.620 --> 34:37.620
No, no, no, no.

34:37.620 --> 34:42.620
First, by not engaging in any form of sexual intercourse or activity.

34:42.620 --> 34:46.620
And then being mindful in regard to the food,

34:46.620 --> 34:50.620
then that can lead you out of the central,

34:50.620 --> 34:51.620
central domain,

34:51.620 --> 34:54.620
or rather have your mind established above central domain.

34:54.620 --> 34:57.620
But you can be mindful as much as you want around the food

34:57.620 --> 35:00.620
if you spend your day engaging in sexual thoughts

35:00.620 --> 35:04.620
and kind of cultivating and detaining those,

35:04.620 --> 35:05.620
you won't work.

35:05.620 --> 35:07.620
So that's why it doesn't need to be abandoned.

35:07.620 --> 35:10.620
You have to stop engaging in it beforehand

35:10.620 --> 35:13.620
and then you can start developing the practice within that.

35:13.620 --> 35:16.620
Hence, the awareness here comes first.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.620
Because both are single-game.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.620
You have a hungry stomach.

35:22.620 --> 35:26.620
And then basically demanding senses, demanding food pleasure.

35:26.620 --> 35:36.620
Well, in this case, obviously,

35:36.620 --> 35:39.620
senses demanding food because they're hungry.

35:39.620 --> 35:41.620
And basically,

35:41.620 --> 35:44.620
attending to their hunger by eating,

35:44.620 --> 35:47.620
provides you with pleasure.

35:47.620 --> 35:50.620
Even if it's not necessarily food that you prefer.

35:50.620 --> 35:52.620
So that's already...

35:52.620 --> 35:55.620
If you're not mindful, that's already a hook, that's already a belt.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.620
That's what I mean.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.620
Like you can try running away from your preferences for as much as you want.

35:59.620 --> 36:00.620
But that's beside the point.

36:00.620 --> 36:02.620
The point is that you may mindful through and through.

36:02.620 --> 36:04.620
But you eat whether you prefer it or not.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.620
Why? Because even the food that you don't prefer.

36:06.620 --> 36:08.620
When you are hungry,

36:08.620 --> 36:12.620
it will provide you with simple pleasure of being food for your hungry stomach.

36:12.620 --> 36:17.620
And that pleasure, it can be essential pleasure if you are hungry and you got it.

36:20.620 --> 36:26.620
Doesn't matter if the food you put in your mouth is agreeable or not.

36:26.620 --> 36:29.620
Because both have or might have a belt.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.620
It doesn't say that only food that you prefer has a belt.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.620
And you should avoid it.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.620
No, does it say food that you hate hasn't been known?

36:36.620 --> 36:37.620
It says food has a belt.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.620
Food might be a belt.

36:39.620 --> 36:48.620
So that's why actually preference or not is completely seconded thing.

36:48.620 --> 36:52.620
Once you've been rooted in practice,

36:52.620 --> 36:54.620
you've been rooted in the mindfulness.

36:54.620 --> 36:57.620
And then there would have been preferences.

36:57.620 --> 37:00.620
They were based on other preferences.

37:00.620 --> 37:03.620
They were completely based on just pure pleasure.

37:03.620 --> 37:04.620
These are the pleasure.

37:04.620 --> 37:06.620
And they will fall off.

37:06.620 --> 37:13.620
Because now all of them require that attitude of non-mindfulness at the very root.

37:13.620 --> 37:19.620
But once you start out with the other preferences won't necessarily fall off.

37:19.620 --> 37:22.620
You can still tell now this is a nice food.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.620
That was not so nice food.

37:24.620 --> 37:26.620
That was quite rough.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.620
Oh, the food smells really bad.

37:28.620 --> 37:31.620
I even have a gag reflex.

37:31.620 --> 37:35.620
But that's nothing to do with just the fact.

37:35.620 --> 37:39.620
This is about how those hardest animals respond to it.

37:39.620 --> 37:44.620
But if you eat it unmindful, even the most horrible food in the world,

37:44.620 --> 37:49.620
you still remain as a probably even more enslaved because you think you're not enslaved

37:49.620 --> 37:53.620
by avoiding preference, preferred food.

37:53.620 --> 37:58.620
Well, actually, you remain even like equally enslaved by thinking you're less enslaved

37:58.620 --> 38:00.620
while that adds another layer of slavery to it.

38:00.620 --> 38:02.620
That you yourself create it.

38:02.620 --> 38:08.620
And that's why you do have those extreme ascetics who eat feces or who knows what.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.620
Just horrible, horrible stuff.

38:10.620 --> 38:13.620
And there wouldn't be only one who has a brilliant new day of life.

38:13.620 --> 38:15.620
Probably even worse.

38:15.620 --> 38:33.620
So, yeah, I mean to be dispassionate towards food.

38:33.620 --> 38:39.620
It's not because food tastes bad, not because it's horrible food,

38:39.620 --> 38:42.620
but because it's there.

38:42.620 --> 38:46.620
Because Mara might have placed the bait in it.

38:46.620 --> 38:50.620
The bait has nothing to do with agreeable or disagreeable food.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.620
It has to do with Mara.

38:52.620 --> 38:54.620
It's in food.

38:54.620 --> 38:57.620
So, as I said, you don't actually have to have the food, you have to eat.

38:57.620 --> 39:00.620
So, then you do, okay, so I just have to eat this food.

39:00.620 --> 39:08.620
So, then I'll just take great care to avoid falling and biting and chewing into the bait.

39:08.620 --> 39:12.620
And that's it.

39:12.620 --> 39:15.620
And that's the body's business, food.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.620
Yeah, yeah, that's not your business, really.

39:18.620 --> 39:25.620
Which you have to, you know, tend to every day, every day.

39:25.620 --> 39:28.620
So, means every day you need to be mindful of the bait.

39:28.620 --> 39:31.620
Every day you need to be mindful of the trap and the snare.

39:31.620 --> 39:37.620
And then, yeah, oh yeah, so the practice is basically about every day mindfulness.

39:37.620 --> 39:41.620
And the repetitive drilling.

39:55.620 --> 39:59.620
Food is quite a burden, isn't it?

39:59.620 --> 40:01.620
It's burdensome.

40:01.620 --> 40:04.620
Well, no, Mara is a burden.

40:04.620 --> 40:11.620
Because he's relentless in having that big place in the food.

40:11.620 --> 40:15.620
So, but again, he has everything right to do so.

40:15.620 --> 40:18.620
Because the food belongs to him.

40:18.620 --> 40:22.620
The food, the taste, and the tongue belongs to him.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.620
The sights and eyes belong to him.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.620
The sound and ears belong to him.

40:27.620 --> 40:32.620
You remember this, because it's because people take that which belongs to Mara.

40:32.620 --> 40:36.620
Mara does what he wants, well, with them, but I can't have it.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.620
And what is that he takes?

40:38.620 --> 40:40.620
It's the eye and the sights.

40:40.620 --> 40:41.620
It's the ear and the sound.

40:41.620 --> 40:43.620
It's the nose and the smells.

40:43.620 --> 40:46.620
So, you know, it's the same your senses, actually, belong to him.

40:46.620 --> 40:50.620
So, it's every right to put whatever he wants in it.

40:50.620 --> 40:53.620
And it's you who keep biting carelessly.

40:53.620 --> 40:58.620
And then, hooking yourself like a mindless fish.

40:58.620 --> 41:03.620
And that's the deal.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.620
That's what some sorry is.

41:05.620 --> 41:07.620
That's what an existence is.

41:07.620 --> 41:15.620
A person can complain about it, feel sorry for himself, but that's just how it is.

41:15.620 --> 41:22.620
And you would complain about it, feel sorry, because you're still refusing to give up your ownership of those things.

41:22.620 --> 41:27.620
I still feel entitled to your eyes and to the sights.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.620
Like that was the first.

41:29.620 --> 41:58.620
I can't wait for you.
