1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But based on how I did yesterday, this session, I was thinking that the paper we were talking

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
about can it be understood as the field on which the particular manifest?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes and no.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes in a sense that, yeah, it is a particular arise on the basis of that more general or more

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
peripheral. That's really the sense basis for example I refer to as can be translated as

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,600
fields with the same, in the same sense actually because the sense objects that arise on

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
the particular level, they arise on the basis of the field of the eye.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But the problem is, that's why it's yes, but it can be answered no if you give that field

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
some sort of priority over the particular, because that field is a negative phenomenon.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's defined by the things that arise particularly.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So you can discern that there is a field because the eye objects are present,

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
because the particular things have a reason, the peripheral is generated because of that.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's defined because of that. So it's not independent of the particular.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So I mean the question you asked is valid, but sometimes it can be asked in a sense of which is first,

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
which is more important, which is greater and in that sense I have to be able to answer

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
because then people just think, okay so there is this field and then things arise upon the field

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
but if you think like that, you're taking that field to be the particular,

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
which means something else is then very thorough in regard to that thought of that very defined field.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So it's one thing to understand it, the level of your mind sort of thinking intellectually

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and it's important to clarify as much as you can.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But as I said, if you want to recognize it as the actual phenomena that fill these,

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
there is always generated on the basis of the current particular.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's how you start, like you just mindfulness or present situation of the body and so on

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and then based on that, this is already there, so you just need to discern it

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and then recognize that which you have intellectually grasped beforehand.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Because now you have sort of the information and the data to sort of identify things as they are in this certain manner.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So in that sense, in that sense, yes, things arise on the basis of the field

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
but in return that field is defined by the things that arise on the basis of it.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So what you have, number of the term is Vinyana,

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
it as much as Vinyana, the term is number of two sticks holding each other.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
One is not more than the other and one cannot even be conceived

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
with the other being simultaneously present.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And that's how, by full understanding that there is absolutely no room

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
for the sense of self or the appropriation to remain there

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
because it becomes completely redundant.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The whole picture, these two sticks, they don't need any master operator.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Basically, they support each other for as long as the five aggregates are present,

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
things will be arising and manifesting and defining itself, defining everything.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And everything else will continue operating, so to speak.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The intention and the volition, all that would stay,

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
but what wouldn't stay is the owner of it, because there's no room for the owner.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The owner is part of the stick, so what can you own?

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Can you own the left stick?

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If it's being supported by the right one, you can't.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You realize, well, I think I own it.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If the right stick goes, the left one cannot stay.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Can you own the right stick?

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If it's being held by the left one.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And you can't hold them both at the same time,

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
because that will imply you stepping outside of your experience

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and then taking up the hold of its foundations, which you can't do there.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So that's the practice, basically.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's the big personal in that sense. It's that repetition of that contemplation

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
of this mutual dependence on these things whereby,

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
by fully discerning that, you automatically squeeze out any sense of appropriation itself,

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
because it's just inconceivable to be there at the same time.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It becomes redundant, completely.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So, if you use the approach of Salayatina, the sense basis, yes,

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
they're the negative, they're the base, they're the field.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I think the old translations of Nyanimalitera,

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the first was, well, he was so then experimenting with it at some point,

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
it was the field, the field.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think the video is as well referring to it as such.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Because from yesterday, when I was meditating,

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I actually realized that it seems that all the Salayatanas are all the time operating

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and your attention just pick up one small piece,

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
so you have one moment from that whole inconceivable amount of possibilities

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and you actually have no idea what will come in the next moment.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Or you have a very limited idea.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And that limit is given to you by the thing beforehand.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So, in that sense, you're not in a control, even of that idea.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, you just come right after votes.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So, you think it's all going to be set up?

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah. And you just come on the scene.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it is the six sense basis,

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
these six fields of possibilities, the six negative, six peripherals,

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
if that's the approach you take,

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
yeah, they are simultaneously present there all the time.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And your attention, obviously, lies on the basis of one particular moment.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We die, thought, whatever takes your fancy or presses you the hardest.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And can you explain what keeps the narrative?

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, the narrative, yes, organising.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes, exactly. The narrative is kept by the mind,

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
because the five senses meet in the mind.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, the mind does, for its own object,

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
has the overview of the five senses.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's how they're intelligible.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now, you have a protugener has an extra layer of narrative,

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
which is his act of other.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And he senses self.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That adds a whole, another assumed dimension of another point of view

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that's external to all of this.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Like, the mind, that's just other hand as well.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Like, he has a narrative, he has a context.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He can still operate and talk, and discern, and choose, and prefer,

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
because the mind is where the senses meet.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Obviously, the mind cannot be overwhelmed by the senses anymore.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So, nothing that he chooses or prefers would be based on anything unwholesome.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But for protugener, he has assumed another completely gratuitous dimension of

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
his sense of self being independent of both that mind and all those senses.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's just completely outside.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's holding both of the sticks, because that's the idea of the self.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's the notion of self.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's the meaning of it, the mastery, you are in charge.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So, you can see how much more complex than the narrative becomes,

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and much more unpredictable as well.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And that's exactly why having the sense of self results in suffering.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Because you're trying your sort of acting as if you are the center of experience,

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
yet at every single experience you have, that is being undermined through the very experience.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So, that's why if a protugener would stop engaging in the world,

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
stop engaging in the desires, practicing the strength,

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
going to close himself in a little cell, in a little room,

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
first it would be the boredom they would come.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And then it would be a shared dread of fear.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And many people would lose their minds.

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If there is nothing, nothing, taking away that fear.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why? Because they remain holding.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They cannot not hold to their sense of self, to their assumed external entity, really.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That it's just being now crushed from every possible conceivable direction.

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And he recognizes the prospect of it, he feels it.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's why it's so terrifying.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's why when the protugener would talk to the Buddha sometimes,

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and he would tell what he teaches,

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
they would understand what he, they would understand the dispression,

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the point of view of Nibbana,

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
like abandoning it all before it's taken away.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But they wouldn't let go of the sense of self.

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So then that understanding would completely make them go mad.

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
They would fall on the ground over their hair, be their breast,

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
basically full on panic attack and dread.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Because they don't let go of the self.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yet they understood clearly that all these things,

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
they've come to an end that's our phones.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yet if the self owns means self will be owning its ending as well.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The ending of those things, but it can't.

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So you realize the self will be destroyed.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And then they would lament and say what that will destroy us.

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That will kill us.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There will be nothing left.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Because in their mind it's the self,

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
that sort of governs all these things.

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It seems that this approach can relate this thing, this thing.

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And this thing is that notion of self,

145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
because if you realize how broad,

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and you think that it's not just your particular experience,

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
but there is that whole thing is around,

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
which you can't control.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Probably it's a bad word.

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I know what you mean, but it probably is equal.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It will extinguish that dimension

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that is being gratuitously maintained and generated

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
as an external dimension to the whole experience,

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and the self abides and lives as the master, as the God.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Once you start noticing that that dimension,

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
it's already peripheral,

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that has peripheral to it,

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you realize there is no outside to you.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Because when you think outside,

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that's the experience inside.

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So even your thoughts of external

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
are experienced right here right now in turn of.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Which means you can't step outside of your experience.

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And that's not hard to grasp on the intellectual.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It kind of makes sense.

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But drilling it long enough until the mind stops

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
sort of wavering and going out of it,

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
even with those kind of careless lazy thinking assumptions,

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
that will take time.

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But the more you do it,

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the more sort of your kind of,

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
well, as I said, you're sort of fading away

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
that notion of external dimension.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because no matter what external dimension you're thinking,

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
presently right now, mindfully,

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you realize that's already surrounded by its own peripheral,

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
which means it cannot be the ultimate external,

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
which means it cannot be the ultimate owner,

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the ultimate self, the ultimate God, the ultimate anyway.

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's all a reason on the basis of the particular experience.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And then it was, yeah, that was the whole point.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was just that little kind of careless way

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
of attending to things assuming the external

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
to yourself, to your experience,

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
to others, doesn't matter.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There was enough, there was enough for his whole mess

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
of some sort, nothing else.

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's why ignorance and wrong views

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the most plain word you think, nothing else.

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And also, that's why careless attention

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
is in the beginning of the whole.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And that's why somebody just sort of stops gradually,

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
fades away, the assuming of that external dimension.

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He basically stops assuming the art of other.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That is actually what art of other is.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So, he becomes free from the factor of the self-review.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So, isn't so that,

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Ionisomanasitara is actually in regards

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to these things we are talking about.

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, Ionisomanasitara, Ionisom is womb.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So, basically, the root, the beginning.

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So, you could see, if the normal attention

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
is attention, it's usually completely focused upon the object.

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And even if it steps away from the object into more general picture,

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
it makes that an object.

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So, always, the measure for ordinary Ionisomanasitara

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
is the object, that's it.

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It doesn't see anything simultaneously present

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
that's peripheral to that attended object.

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But if it starts to train itself

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
to start noticing other things while

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
it is still attending the present object,

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
whatever object is, whatever the sense

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
there might have been, sort of, most dominant.

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If it starts noticing those particular

216
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
without making them into a new object,

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you keep your old attention, so to speak, on the object.

218
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And simultaneously, while that is present,

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you start noticing other things that they are simultaneously present

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but not the object.

221
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So, basically, you start trying to mind

222
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
to discern other things different from that

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
which you are used to discerning, which is only an object.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So, it's the same, through the same attention,

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
you start looking at the origins of that object.

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What's behind it?

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What's around it?

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What's higher than it?

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The nature or the structure?

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, so you start looking at the structure of it.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You start looking at the womb from which it all originated.

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So, that's why it's young.

233
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's a monasticity.

234
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's a proper attention.

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's not like people often

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
to state proper attention improperly

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
or rather lazily and carelessly,

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
whereby it just means like,

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
oh, it's a wholesome attention.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's just when you attend good.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And you think, no, it's much more precise than that.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's why it's such a fundamental aspect.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's like one of the factors for the right view.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Equal important as the word of the Buddha.

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So, you can have all the words of the Buddha

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and all the Buddhas.

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If you have no proper attention,

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
none of that will make sense or take root.

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah.

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So, basically, discerning the structure

251
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
through their reason thing,

252
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
without sort of making it into a new thing,

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
because then the structure is somewhere else.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So, basically, that's how you train your attention

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
to become proper attention.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So, it attends to whatever attend,

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
but it sees beyond it.

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes.

260
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So, it doesn't get locked on to just the face value

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
of the reason thing.

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

263
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes.

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I still feel that there is actually a danger

265
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that instead of, like, seeing the structure,

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
you just set back and you want the broader...

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, it has to start like that.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah.

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It has to start like that.

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But as long as you know that you will be supposed

271
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to be seeing the peripheral in regard to whatever,

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
it's currently present.

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So, yes.

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You set back, you broaden the experience,

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
but then that becomes particular.

276
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Isn't it?

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But then through that,

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
you keep this turning further.

279
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But if there is no entry,

280
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
it's infinite, in that sense.

281
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You can keep doing that as much as you like.

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And the whole point of doing it is to start

283
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
discerning that principle,

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
field, and the thing that isn't upon the field,

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
that defines field in its return.

286
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

287
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So, that's why, in some sense,

288
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
you don't necessarily have to have,

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
kind of, greatly developed,

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
mind to discerne the principle of,

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
but it's some other of that interdependence.

292
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You don't need to,

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
because you can discerne the principle

294
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
upon very basic things,

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
but you discerne the same principle.

296
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes.

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There is this.

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There is this.

299
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes.

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
With this, this is.

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes.

302
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is present, this is present, that's it.

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So, when there is a field,

304
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
for things to be sort of arisen upon,

305
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
things arise upon it,

306
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
which in return define that field

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
as that which they are not at the time,

308
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
they are arisen upon it.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So, it's fully mutually determining each other,

310
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and you realize that's how everything works, in that sense.

311
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So, yes, in a way,

312
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
but it isn't quite explaining how everything works.

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
In a very direct,

314
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
insightful manner,

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
where if you understand it,

316
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
you automatically stop

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
regarding things as you are.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're automatically free from yourself.

319
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So, you're basically,

320
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
if you fully develop it,

321
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you become an arunt.

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But it doesn't explain it in a sense

323
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
of telling you what's happening,

324
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and it provides us an explanation.

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It kind of requires time,

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and it's sort of linear

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and successful things,

328
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and when this changes,

329
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and this goes ahead,

330
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
as I say, oh, yeah,

331
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
they really, that's right there,

332
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
they really make sense of something like that.

333
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's much more precise than that.

334
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So, it's not necessarily wrong.

335
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I mean, it is actually.

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It is wrong in a sense that,

337
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
but this one,

338
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
but it should be taken as a precise thing,

339
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
because then people will take it seriously,

340
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and then try to discern this very thing.

341
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But it's very, very hard to discern,

342
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
as you can see for yourself.

343
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Now, you're starting to get the idea,

344
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
what it refers to,

345
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
but actually, discerning it,

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and then discerning this relationship,

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
is just the same principle,

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
because every participant starts

349
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
with this, this is,

350
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and then we watch what is,

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and then it carries on

352
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
into 12 factors,

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
or 16 factors,

354
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
or 8 factors,

355
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
depending on how the book describes it,

356
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
on different occasions.

357
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But it's the same principle

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that's being described.

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So, you could see,

360
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
what kind of understanding

361
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
would be required to see that principle

362
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
in all those intricate ways

363
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
of relating to each other,

364
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
as the book that would have described,

365
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
but it's not part of the birth

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and everything else,

367
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
as phenomena.

368
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But the good news is,

369
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
you don't have to.

370
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
All you have to do is see the principle,

371
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
which is basically nothing else,

372
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and saying,

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
oh, yes, whatever has a reason,

374
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
for that reason,

375
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
it's impermanent.

376
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I understand, basically,

377
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
if you really see the principle,

378
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
then do the village

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
or extinguish that notion of art?

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes.

381
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's why it was said,

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
in the suitors,

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Sariputra said,

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I think,

385
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
one who sees the,

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Sariputra said,

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
one who sees Dhamma,

388
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
sees Patit Sampada.

389
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
One who sees Patit Sampada,

390
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
sees the Dhamma here.

391
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes.

392
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And you realize,

393
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
also,

394
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
it must be

395
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
as important,

396
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
as any other,

397
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
kind of directly relevant aspect of the Dhamma.

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But the problem is,

399
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
there's so much,

400
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
obviously, wrong notions,

401
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
explanations, views,

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
based upon Patit Sampada today.

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So,

404
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
it's probably embedded

405
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
if people don't bother with it,

406
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
in that sense,

407
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
try to figure it out,

408
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
because it's,

409
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
because there's so much out,

410
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
it's quite likely

411
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
they'll be pulled to one wrong side

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
or the other,

413
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and end up doing it wrongly.

414
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's not,

415
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
it's not necessarily

416
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
crucial,

417
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
or the deal breaker,

418
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
if person still remains authentic,

419
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and knows why they're practicing

420
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and what,

421
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
what's supposed to sort of

422
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
be uprooted

423
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
with the understanding,

424
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
they'll figure it out eventually.

425
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But,

426
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
it's really not not necessary.

427
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Just understand the principle.

428
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Don't worry about it.

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
12 or 8 or 16,

430
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
whichever way they will describe it,

431
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you don't worry about it.

432
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Just understand the two sticks supporting each other.

433
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Just understand,

434
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
peripheral and actual,

435
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
actual peripheral.

436
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

437
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Because fully understanding it

438
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
will leave no room

439
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
for the sense of self to be assumed at.

440
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And that's all.

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The self was never there,

442
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
as you can see,

443
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
yet,

444
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
by not knowing that he's there,

445
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
so the presence

446
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
of not knowledge,

447
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
of non-knowledge,

448
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
that self cannot be there,

449
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
the presence of that phenomena,

450
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
places the self there

451
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
to the extent of that phenomena.

452
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So if you had not knowledge,

453
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that self cannot be there,

454
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
was great,

455
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
quite sort of spread around your experience,

456
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
yourself,

457
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
is to the same extent spread about.

458
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So you're fully responsible for it.

459
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Then consequently,

460
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
fully understood,

461
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
fully removing the non-knowledge,

462
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
replacing with knowledge,

463
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
that self cannot be anywhere there,

464
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
the self is not anywhere there.

465
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And that's why there is the element of nibbana

466
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
in Putujana's experience.

467
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's nothing other than say

468
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
there's a possibility of him

469
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
to achieve nibbana,

470
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
to free himself from himself.

471
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then it's possible

472
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
because the structure

473
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
can never be actually penetrated

474
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
or affected by the self.

475
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If it were,

476
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
then means the self

477
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
would have some input.

478
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And it would be.

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It would be a sort of a master.

480
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But it's not.

481
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But until you know that,

482
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
then it is.

483
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes.

484
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's why you said,

485
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Upadana is not a five aggregates.

486
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Not all of them,

487
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
not even one of them,

488
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
not even bits of them,

489
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
nothing.

490
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But there is no Upadana without them.

491
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So it's in regard to them.

492
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
In the same self,

493
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
in the same sense,

494
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
the self is in regard to the experience as a whole.

495
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But it's not actually there,

496
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
which is why for Putujana,

497
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
who doesn't question itself,

498
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
he assumes it elsewhere.

499
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I external to the whole thing.

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Once you take that away,

501
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
then you realize,

502
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
as well,

503
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
it cannot be elsewhere.

504
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So you can't hide there.

505
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Certainly you can't fit in here.

506
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Then it fades.

507
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You left it no choice.

508
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So that's why you kind of indirectly,

509
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
you keep shutting down

510
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the escape routes

511
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
for the assumption of the self.

512
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You can't directly stop assuming.

513
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's when an environment

514
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
sees it,

515
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the origin needs to be unscrewed.

516
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You can't just knock it out as a peg.

517
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Knock it out as a peg.
