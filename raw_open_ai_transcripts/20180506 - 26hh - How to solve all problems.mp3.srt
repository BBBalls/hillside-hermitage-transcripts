1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Well, all the problems can be solved if you see that all problems are caused by craving

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,600
people with sheer responsibility. There's no problem if there's no suffering. Or

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,400
rather, when there is a problem, means it's something is a problem because it's

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:44,840
making you suffer. Well, headache in itself, it's not a problem nor is it a

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,440
suffering. You're not wanting it to be that way and I wanted to have a headache

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,120
while having or not having a headache is not in your control. That's why you

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,920
suffer. So you crave to get rid of the circumstances that you find this

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,040
pleasing, which means you create a problem. That's what I mean. At the root of

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,680
every suffering is craving. It's impossible to experience suffering without

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,760
having the present craving present in your experience as your attitude. It's

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,520
impossible. That's what it would have said that the root of suffering is craving.

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:28,680
Not the external circumstances, however bad they might be.

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,760
Poverty is not suffering. Poverty is hardship, but hardship does not need to be

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:41,300
suffering. If you don't, basically, again, in a fundamental level, if you want to

15
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:49,480
describe the nature of craving, there's these three types. When circumstances are

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:56,360
pleasing, you're craving for more of that pleasure. The circumstances at this

17
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:03,440
pleasing, you are craving for that this pleasure to disappear, to not be there.

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,120
You want to get rid of it instantly. And the third type is the subtlest to see, but

19
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,680
basically, the circumstances are neither good nor bad. You kind of crave towards

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:22,280
indolence and searching excitement or whatever. People fear boredom. They fear

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,560
the neutral environment, which is neither good nor bad. They can't recognize it as

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:36,480
peaceful. So in that very manner, a person is fully responsible for all of the

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,600
suffering they've experienced in this life. Because there were even cases in

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,400
the suitors that the Buddha was giving the example of, was even if a highway

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,560
robbers attack you and sever you, limb my limb and torture you. That basically

26
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,480
won't be the suffering for you. It will be your craving in regard to it, your

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,200
hatred towards them, trying to get rid of it, thinking why they're doing this,

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,280
they shouldn't be doing this. Basically, trying to control the circumstances that

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,480
are disagreeable, without recognizing that actually, fundamentally, they're not in

30
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,280
your control. And you're responsible for lack of that knowledge, which then

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,280
generates more craving. So you just keep revolving around it.

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,280
So it's also instead of trying to solve every little issue that you have?

33
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,680
Exactly, yeah. That's when people don't see the, well, they don't see the

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,080
root of suffering. So they think the suffering is the, the circumstances around

35
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,280
them. So then they try to address every single instance, every example, every

36
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,680
issue, every person to talk to, everything disagreeable put away. I mean, that's

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,680
usually what people live revolver on.

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
That ends.

39
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Yeah, it ends because it's misapplied. It's not applied with the problem is.

40
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:03,080
Which is, which is craving, yeah. So you're basically trying to solve your

41
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:31,080
suffering by at a completely wrong place where the suffering isn't.
