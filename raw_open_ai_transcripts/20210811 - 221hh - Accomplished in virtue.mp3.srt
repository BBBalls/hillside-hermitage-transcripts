1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,440
So this is a sutta maybe for monks really, a discussion for monks, maybe they would understand

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:35,240
it a bit more. But in any case it's called one in training. So the Buddha says, monks

3
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:45,120
of this recitation of more than 150 training wars, he means patimoka, comes up every fortnight

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,600
in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train themselves. They are

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,800
these three trainings under which all that is gathered, which the training in heightened

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,200
virtue, the training in heightened mind and the training in heightened discernment. These

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,920
are the three trainings under which all that is gathered. So there is a case where a monk

8
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:23,200
is fully accomplished in virtue, moderately accomplished in samadhi and moderately accomplished

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,760
in discernment. With reference to the lesser and minor training wars, he falls into offences

10
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:41,880
and rehabilitates himself, he confesses them and says, why is that? Because I, so why is

11
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,880
that? Because I have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances,

12
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,840
meaning being holy accomplished in virtue, doesn't disqualise that yet. But as for

13
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,520
the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life, he is one

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,600
of permanent virtue, one of steadfast virtue. Having undertaken him, he trains in reference

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,760
to the training rules. And with the ending of the first three fetters, he is a stream

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,200
winner, a sotopanna, never again destined for the states of woe, certain, headed for

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,560
self-awaking. And it goes on through that through the different levels of attainment

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,720
all the way up to Arahantsha. On the basis of that, fully accomplished in virtue, fully

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:39,400
accomplished in the same sense that the mountain stream would fill out the bottom pools, they

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,160
would overfill and fill up the bottom pools. And eventually even the sea would be filled

21
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,400
up. And at the end of that sutta, he says, those who are partially accomplished attain

22
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:57,160
the path, those who are fully accomplished attain the full thing. The training rules

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:05,800
I tell you are not in vain. And that's the important part. The rules that are essence

24
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,360
of the training are basically the eight precepts. Whenever the guru will talk about the wise

25
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,760
man of the past, the virtuous people of the past, it's the eight precepts of these principles

26
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,760
that you can have many other rules in the monastic manner, many other rules, but they're

27
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,080
all kind of within that. The one, the rules, the matter. Then you have the circumstantial

28
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,160
social rules and so on minor rules. But the ones that matter for the training are basically

29
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,760
the ones that are around lust, aversion, distraction, and delusion. That's it. So yes, that's meant

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,040
for monks, but actually even the late person, if they become accomplished in eight precepts,

31
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,920
they can expect the same. Heightened mind and heightened discernment. Many lay people

32
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,040
in the sutta were Anagamis, they were teaching monks, the new monks, because they were so

33
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,960
developed. So what is that development? Is it the technical

34
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:10,160
letter of the rule, prescribed by the contemporary tradition? Where is it? So what is that accomplishment?

35
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,440
What does it make accomplished? Is it knowing the letter of every rule and looking for

36
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,960
every technicality or knowing the state of mind and intention behind directions, which

37
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:26,200
is closer? So whenever people are latching onto technicalities and the letter of the

38
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,280
rules, it's when the intention for the state of mind is either obscured, not taking responsibility

39
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,400
for or blatantly just to be avoided. So you don't feel responsible, because this is the

40
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,440
tradition that I follow, this is the rules that I follow, this is the letter that I follow,

41
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,080
and I don't think, I don't need to think for myself. And because of that, you can follow

42
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,080
such rules in such manner for hundreds of years, have like the full ordination, the

43
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,920
highest approval, and still not be accomplished in virtue. And that's exactly what Cilabhar

44
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:10,480
Paramah says, taking on virtue as a sense of external duty, for which you're not allowing

45
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,280
yourself to feel responsible for internally. And why would a person not allow themselves

46
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,960
to feel responsible for that? Because the moment you become responsible, you become liable

47
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,320
to doubt. So that's exactly why Cilabhar Paramahasa is bundled with a factor of doubt. If you actually

48
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,560
manage to break yourself away from the dependence on the external letter and take responsibility

49
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,160
for the virtue, you will creating a basis for overcoming the factor of doubt. But if you

50
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,160
don't allow yourself to step away from it in that correct sense, in that correct direction,

51
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,480
you will never overcome doubt. Because the reason why the duty is imposed by yourself

52
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,960
to yourself is so the doubt cannot arise. And you often see that when a mind that's dependent

53
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,080
on the letter, somebody points out that their letter might be wrong, they're overwhelmed.

54
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,000
I mean, we witness it many times. Overwhelmed with the existential doubt, because they realize

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,800
everything leading up to that was based on that letter saying what it says, so I didn't

56
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,800
feel responsible for it. Yet now somebody just questions that. They don't even prove

57
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,560
that the letter of your rule is wrong. They just start questioning and you are shaking.

58
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,040
And if that doesn't concern you means you lack even basic authenticity, basic self-awareness.

59
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,400
And that's why there is no right view for you. So you need to understand that that yes,

60
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,600
you learn the letter of the rules, but depending how far you're going to go into the letter

61
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,280
of the rules and why. Is it because I'm not really still understanding the rule? Sure,

62
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,920
go further. Is it? No, I understand the rule, but I want more technicalities to prevent

63
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,600
me from myself and from my own mind. Oh, you want to avoid the practice? Because that's

64
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,000
where Samad is as we said before. Things that want to overwhelm the mind, the monk doesn't

65
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,840
let the mind being overwhelmed. That's his practice of Samadhi. So you understood the

66
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,600
rule, you understand the eight precepts, you understand the ten precepts, you understand

67
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:22,080
150 training rules. If you're not clear about some rule, you clarify it. That's it. Now,

68
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,600
you practice. You practice in a way by keep making sure when you're about to act, you

69
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,240
act according with those rules or you have the calling with an ingredient on a version

70
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,880
on delusion. If you break it, you see where you broke it, you see why you broke it, and

71
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,120
you don't need to depend on technicality because you're always aware of your intention

72
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,960
behind the actions. And then if somebody points out technicality allows you this, but it's

73
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,500
like it doesn't. The state of mind doesn't allow you to do that. So if you actually

74
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,800
stop looking, if you start looking at the context of the rules, eight precepts, 150

75
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,560
precepts, and maintain the context of the rules in your mind, there will be no loopholes

76
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,160
for you, and there will be no need for the loopholes. If you start looking at the letter

77
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,000
that gets proliferated more and more and more into this definition of a sub definition

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,280
of a sub definition, then all of it, it will be about loopholes. It will be about things

79
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,360
that are left not addressed, and you know they come under the same context, but you

80
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,280
have drifted away from that context so much now into these particulars that you lost

81
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,080
the sight of the forest pretty much. And that's exactly when people and monks become

82
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,720
technical. Well technically I'm not breaking the rule and stuff. It's like, what is the

83
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,180
state of mind behind that action? You are breaking the virtue and the story. There is

84
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:50,440
no accomplishment in virtue unless you take the virtue on that level of the mind. But

85
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,840
people confuse learning about the rules, learning about technicalities for keeping the rules

86
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,000
and keeping the technicalities. In other words, they feel justified in not taking it personally,

87
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,600
in not taking responsibility for it, but projecting and keeping responsibility on the level of

88
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,240
well that's the tradition, that's the authority, that's how it's been for hundreds of years,

89
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,040
doesn't matter. You can choose to accept the tradition, the traditional rules, the traditions,

90
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,080
the standards, that's all fine. But even if you do so, you still have to recognize that

91
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,000
you're responsible for that. You're responsible for either choosing to interpret things for

92
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,120
yourself, for either choosing to follow this commentary, for either choosing to follow

93
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,200
someone else's interpretation or someone else's tradition, it's on you. Nothing justifies

94
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:39,040
you in choosing that. So in other words, you need to recognize that whether you understand

95
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,320
it for yourself directly or whether you follow someone else's interpretation, you need to

96
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,880
know why you are doing it. That needs to be clear to you. So if I ask you, oh, do you

97
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,240
give you a pre-set, yes. Well, the fifth pre-set, what's your standard on it? How do you understand

98
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,160
such and such circumstance? And you tell me, well, I follow the tradition of such and

99
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,800
such teacher. I, as a dog, that's fine. Why? You should be able to tell me, why do you

100
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,840
follow that? In other words, how is that way of like following that particular interpretation

101
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,600
or the rule or take on the rule? How is that feeding your accomplishment in virtue directly?

102
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,400
How is that connected to it? You can't just say, I follow because he's a great teacher.

103
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,040
Well, yeah, but what is the benefit of following that? Do you see that for yourself? Or you're

104
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,720
just going by mere reputation and mere tradition and hearsay, which is, you know, the Buddha

105
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,480
said many times something you shouldn't really do, unless you're very unwise. So be a follow,

106
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,360
you know, clarify whatever else, but never feel justified on just, oh, well, I belong

107
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,800
to this great tradition now. And these are our standards. And that's the end of the game

108
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,840
there. No. Why? Why do I keep these standards? Do I keep them authentically, individually,

109
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,120
personally, internally? In which case, I don't need the tradition in the standards because

110
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,640
it's kept on this level, not on the level of traditional behavior. And that's how exactly

111
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,520
what we're saying. If you actually accomplish yourself on that level in that virtue, where

112
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,720
you're not shying away from doubt by willing to endure it, clarifying the context, maintaining

113
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,840
the context, not proliferating the rule to prevent you from having doubt arise in your

114
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,000
mind again. Well, I will never do that again. Well, but it wasn't an offense. It was not

115
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,400
an issue. It wasn't even rooted in greed aversion delusion. But why am I doubting it?

116
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Because that's what doubt is it's an irrational mind, a hindrance that tries to throw your

117
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,560
way, tries to make you act out of it. And here you are acting out of it. Because now

118
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,960
you're redefining and making new rules. So you will never do stuff that you know was

119
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,360
nothing wrong with just because you doubted and account of it. And you never you don't

120
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,960
know how to deal with the doubt. So by taking the taking the virtue wrongly, you will not

121
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,160
be able to deal with the doubt because of which you keep taking the virtue wrongly because

122
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,640
of which you can't deal with the doubt. And no samadhi, exactly, absolutely no samadhi

123
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,280
because there is no accomplishment. If you take the virtue rightly and do it without

124
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,600
don't act out of the doubt. Sustain the context of the virtue. No, because you know, you know

125
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,920
what it is, but the mind pressures you to find out more, look into technique, create

126
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,560
this, create that act, left, left, right, avoid, prevent. If you sustain that and not

127
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,040
act out of it, you will become accomplished in the virtue. And basically, how did you

128
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,080
do that? Oh, that's already the practice of samadhi. Not moving in regard to the mind

129
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,840
they want to move you. And that's what the Buddha said is just if somebody's accomplished,

130
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,720
at least in that basis, three factors will have to be destroyed. You cannot not be a

131
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,720
sautapana if you have taken virtue in that level and endured it. But you will certainly

132
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,640
not be a sautapana if you've taken virtue in the level of the external letter of the

133
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,440
law, the rule, the tradition, the authority, the agenda, the senior monk, whatever else.

134
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,000
Even if they were right, by the way, in the standards that they laid upon you, if you

135
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,600
took it externally, there is no basis for your virtue to actually take place.

136
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,720
So the first preset of not harming, not killing, a living being, why do you keep that? Why

137
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,640
is that wrong? And if you don't know why, you cannot be accomplished. It's just kind

138
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:15,400
of circumstantially taking that external rule. You learn them circumstantially. You investigate

139
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,600
them in circumstantially. But once you start keeping them, no, you need to know for yourself.

140
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,240
Like this needs to be seen personally. Like why this is not done? Why it's not good to

141
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,440
do this? So that's the thing. So you see what is unwholesome, what is wholesome. That is

142
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,040
your discernment. Well, we clear that is that's what you're going to start seeing. You're

143
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,880
going to start seeing wholesome is wholesome and wholesome is unwholesome because you're

144
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,000
seeing the root of that, which makes it unwholesome, what makes it wholesome. But you will not

145
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,800
see that if you just block it and say, Well, this is our tradition. This is my culture.

146
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,200
This is what a Buddhist person does. Well, okay. And that's that's literally applicable

147
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,120
to every other religion. That level of I am such and such identify with every religion

148
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,720
without observance without rule. I keep it. No questions asked. Because it makes you

149
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,680
safe. Well, exactly. Yeah, because we're all questioning means you don't want to keep

150
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,720
it. No question. It means I want to know what I keep. There's no there's no justification

151
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,160
for you assuming cynical reasons for my questioning. Unless it's your own cynical mind putting

152
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,760
that over there. No, I want to understand what I keep. But for many people, even questioning

153
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,200
to understand what will make you like, do I need to keep this? Do I want to keep this?

154
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Do I want to be a monk? Do I want to practice? And that's something also that it makes you

155
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,760
unpleasant, makes you doubtful. So you refuse to think about it, you refuse to question,

156
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,920
you just double down. This is my duty. This is the tradition and you double down on your

157
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,120
own syllabata paramas. The very first fetter because of which, as I said, you can keep

158
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,520
the eight precepts for hundreds years and absolutely have no samadhi and wisdom arising

159
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:59,240
from it. If you look at the beginning of the monastic order, there were no rules. No,

160
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,480
of course. And why? Don't it was clear? Yeah. It was not obscured. People knew exactly

161
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,080
what behaviors were in line with it and what behaviors weren't. Yeah. So and that basic

162
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,120
you can boil it down to don't do anything. Unholesome. No way. Unholesome. Don't do

163
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,840
it. And that's why also as the things sort of progressed back in the Buddhist time, that

164
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,640
whole need for like, you know, a new monk would have to spend like five years training

165
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,080
with senior monk, somebody that they'd accepted him. Because yes, an untrained mind will start

166
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,120
like, you know, will not be able to necessarily even sustain the right context. So you want

167
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,000
to spend the first few years learning that context, but you don't want to spend the first

168
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,680
few years just learning the letter of the some tradition that you go into without actually

169
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,360
understanding why you're doing it or developing that authentic recognition that it's still

170
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,040
up to you, whether you keep it or not, and to what extent and you want to see the intentions

171
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,080
behind your actions there. Because that's often like, okay, so basically even that process

172
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,880
of learning for five years from a senior monk has become like a mechanical letter of stuff

173
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,040
you go through without actually learning. And without monk teaching you either. So just

174
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:21,160
for five years, you're under someone's like tutorship. But in reality is just basically

175
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:30,600
learning of that external form, external letter, not being taught responsibility behind, not

176
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,920
being taught how to see the responsibility behind and how to take it on, in which case

177
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,480
you would, you wouldn't even need them the further definitions of these rules, because

178
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,240
you would be unable to ignore the unwholesome intentions before you act. So you wouldn't

179
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:52,600
act. That's the training. But even training has become like a traditional form. In the

180
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:00,360
same sense, external on a level of syllabata paramasa on the level of virtue. Dead. Well,

181
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,840
yeah, it's just, it's like a dead matter in that sense. Yeah. But individually, anybody

182
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,840
can rekindle it for themselves if they actually exactly started in the suttas, reading the

183
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,880
origin stories and so on. And you start seeing food, you get you get in that livable context

184
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,200
and it's about the state of mind. It's about the lab, the perception how I perceive it.

185
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,200
What I choose to do, it's not about, you know, commentary of a sub commentary of a sub commentary

186
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,120
defining this is allowable. And then another commentary defining that is not allowable.

187
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,360
And me now spending nights and figure out who might be more right than these. No, where

188
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,080
is my attention rooted? You got your answer. And on top of that, not just that you got

189
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,840
the answer as to what is the right thing to do. You also started accomplishing yourself

190
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,800
in virtue, which is a basis for suttapat. So if you don't have the right view, if you

191
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,640
have not reached the few fruits of stream entry is because you haven't been accomplishing

192
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,000
virtue. And it's a good news, because now you know what to do. Comptuous haven virtue.

193
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,800
How do you do that? By taking it personally. Learning the rules, sure, learning interpretation

194
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,240
sure, but not relying on the word of the rule, the authority of interpretation of tradition

195
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,800
as this is why it's kept. No, it's kept because I choose to keep it. And I choose to keep

196
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,680
it because I see direct relationship between that and wholesome mind or not that and unwholesome

197
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:27,720
mind. And that will inevitably initially certainly bring the doubt, bring that sense

198
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,920
of Oh, so I could just decide to not keep exactly. And you're going to feel the weight

199
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:39,800
of keeping that. And that's how you become accomplished. But also doing that, you will

200
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,960
eventually begin to see which rules are actually obsolete. Yes, but you wouldn't really worry

201
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,320
about that. But you would become self evident. Exactly. The minor rules will not affect him.

202
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,920
And he will know that he'd stay confess, he wouldn't have an issue. But the sometimes

203
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,080
the problem is if a person is not accomplishing the virtue, and then get a sense of righteousness

204
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,360
of discovering of this, what we are saying. And then they just try to form a new tradition

205
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,960
of dismissing all the traditions and interpreting things for yourself in a same external manner

206
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,440
of seal about a paramasa. You don't need to change anything. You need to take things

207
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,440
personally. And then what needs to be changed will happen by itself. Because you have the

208
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,960
authentic mind, you have the accomplishment in virtue. Samad is there. What change occurs

209
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,680
will be the right change. You wouldn't have to do it. You wouldn't have to act out of

210
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,840
it. In other words, you would naturally drift away from things that are unsuitable, traditions

211
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,760
that are unsuitable, practices that are unsuitable into the directions that are suitable for the

212
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,720
right view, for dispassion and for everything else, without needing to make a big deal out

213
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:54,720
of it. But you wouldn't become this self righteous, impossible, impossible. You would not either

214
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,720
become scared. You wouldn't be self righteous trying to change everybody. But if everybody

215
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,440
comes after an account of it, you wouldn't show because you know what's right. So you

216
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,160
wouldn't need to change the established external norms. But you wouldn't be afraid to challenge

217
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,720
your mind because it's not rooted in your conceit. It's rooted in recognition of what

218
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,080
the accomplishment of virtue is and the right view. So if you were to question those things,

219
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,600
you wouldn't just, you know, be on a crusade to change though, as I said. But if it comes

220
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:30,800
up to it, you wouldn't be afraid of it. If circumstances bring it up, you will have no

221
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:42,000
issues dealing with it and addressing it. There's another sutta, Samanapala sutta. The Buddha

222
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,480
says, a manlicant, a monk, thus accomplished in virtue, sees no danger in any quarter in

223
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:57,840
regards to their virtuous restraint. It is like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees

224
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,400
no danger from his enemies in any direction. In that same way, a monk, thus accomplished

225
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,920
in virtue, sees no danger in any direction in regards to their virtuous restraint. When

226
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:19,720
they have this aggregate, this domain of noble virtue, this kinder of noble virtue, they

227
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:27,040
experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. That is how a monk is accomplished in virtue.

228
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:34,320
So, yeah, you, the monk who has ceased to depend on the external circumstances, external

229
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:41,680
authority, external definitions, external rules, external requirements, has become accomplished

230
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,200
in virtue because internal criteria, as in not, I choose to interval, no, knowing right

231
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,160
is right, wrong is wrong, wholesome is wholesome, I hope, means knowing last aversion delusion,

232
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,360
sufficiently enough to always see it and not act out of it. You practice that, you will

233
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,000
become accomplished in that and then doesn't matter the circumstance, doesn't matter what

234
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,200
quarter the circumstances arrive at you from what direction. There is no danger because

235
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,180
you're not depending on that. So, if somebody comes and starts questioning the certain

236
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,160
interpretation of a letter or a rule, it doesn't matter because that's not what your virtue

237
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,960
is based on. It was based on you not doing anything out of intention of greed or version

238
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,600
delusion. So, even if somebody says, look, this, all these rules were actually wrong,

239
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,280
they were written by somebody later in Jai, in search of their, they're not right, makes

240
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,800
no difference. And you will actually know that they were right, even if somebody did

241
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,080
add them, they added them rightly because they're according to the standard of dhamma, standard

242
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,320
of dispassion, disenchantment, non-grid, non-version, non-delusion. But for as long as you put the

243
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,760
letter first, the external authority of syllabata baramasa first, you will not see this because

244
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,360
you're refusing to take responsibility for it and allow it to become internal because

245
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,160
it's unpleasant. The weight of it is unpleasant, the weight of responsibility is unpleasant,

246
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,760
the pressure is unpleasant, the liability to doubt it's unpleasant and you have to

247
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:21,240
do it. Developing of samadhi is unpleasant. And same, eight precepts for a lay person same.

248
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,880
That's why often the Buddha would not even overly define things because if the mind hasn't

249
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,120
strayed from the right context of non-grid, non-version, non-delusion, recognizes that

250
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,920
state of mind doesn't act harder with regardless of what the action might be, you don't need

251
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,960
extra and extra layers of definitions and words and interpretations and meanings because

252
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,840
the meaning is there, the context is there, it's clear. So that's practically eight precepts

253
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:55,560
are modern enough, certainly for anagami. In a lay setting, for a monkey, you'll be

254
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:02,320
concerned, accomplished to the same virtue, the same threat. I like the way it's said

255
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:12,720
like that he is accomplished or attained in possessors, the aggregate of virtue. He is

256
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,840
created in aggregate, that now he can recognize. He can recognize and he's encouraged to recollect

257
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,720
and dwell because it will re-inspire confidence and sense of safety and gladness that will

258
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,400
then bring Samadhi and so on to fulfilment and clear understanding of what, what, what,

259
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:38,200
but not without it. And that is, again, that is the entire practice. Your Samadhi comes

260
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,920
out of it, your Panya comes out of it. The more you do it, the more you perfect it,

261
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:49,560
greed aversion, delusion, removed from physical, verbal and mental. That's what Dhamma is.

262
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,640
So start on the physical level and that is your Samadhi, that is your Panya, that is

263
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:04,040
your practice towards Sotabhati and Haya. It's not found elsewhere, it's not found after,

264
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,360
it's right there and then. It's not done for just a short period of time and then. That's

265
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,840
one thing, it's better to even like, if you, if you, or eight pieces too much as a layperson,

266
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,240
take the five precepts for the rest of your life, but not for the weekend. Because means

267
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,360
you never really allow, you never really consider changing the order of what's important to

268
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,200
you. Sensuality is important to you. So now you realise that, yeah, precepts are good

269
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,560
and maybe I should do something about it, but then you only do it like for two or three

270
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:39,560
days or five days. Means, oh, you're just sort of toying with it while at the same time

271
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:45,960
refusing to allow the actual, no centrality to be put second and my precepts will now be

272
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:53,240
first for the rest of my life. And that's important. That's where the jianda takes the

273
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,080
training of virtue. You need to take it in that ultimate sense. Not to this conditional,

274
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,360
I'll do it a bit until I get a meditation experience or something. So it's in that sense,

275
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,760
it's better to have five precepts, but for the rest of your life, then to like, no precepts

276
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,840
and then super or steer level of celibacy for 10 days and then, boom, no precepts at

277
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,360
all. Because that is not accomplishing keeping. It's not accomplishing anything really. Like,

278
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,680
I mean, you're obviously trying. So that's a good thing, I suppose. But you want to recognize

279
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,720
the gradual training starts gradually and starts in that responsible sense, but an absolutely

280
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,400
non-negotiable sense. So you're like, okay, so what can I sustain? And what am I able

281
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,640
to? Can I make this determination for the rest of my life? To not kill, cheat, lie,

282
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,160
steal, misconduct, take in dog skirts. And if just that thought scares you, I can't do

283
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:55,320
this, that you need to do that first before you can even consider the direction of any

284
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,720
practice whatsoever. Because that is the practice. You considering that is the practice. You making

285
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,600
yourself being able to determine to keep the five pieces for the rest of your life or eight

286
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,600
pieces for the rest of your life is the beginning of your accomplishment in virtue. You won't

287
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,800
come up, come, come, like a, you won't result on its own somehow, because you got a very,

288
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,640
very, very potent meditation method that will now, if you adhere to it, just create this

289
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
virtue for you.

290
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:34,920
Now the sutra called the restraint of the patimaka. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the blessed

291
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:25,640
one and asked him,

292
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:42,360
Pranable sir, it would be good if the blessed one would teach me the dhamma in brief so that

293
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,000
having heard the dhamma from the blessed one, I might dwell alone with drawn, diligent,

294
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,600
ardent and residue. And the Buddha replies, in that case bhikkhu purify the very beginning

295
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:04,200
of wholesome states. And what is the beginning of wholesome states? Here bhikkhu dwell restrained

296
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,440
by the restraint of the patimaka, accomplished in good conduct and proper resort seeing danger

297
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,240
in the slightest faults, having undertaken a training rule, straining them. When bhikkhu

298
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,720
dwell restrained in such a way, seeing the danger in the slightest faults, then based

299
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,840
upon that virtue, established upon virtue, you should develop the four establishments

300
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,240
of mindfulness, the satipatana, not before that.

301
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,120
So you're doing your mindfulness before you even accomplish yourself in precepts, it's

302
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,560
just putting the cart in front of a horse and expecting it to move.

303
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,280
There's no way to have that type of discernment.

304
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,120
No, no, but it's the same, that's why it's mindfulness samadhi, it's the same development,

305
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:03,160
same thing that comes on the basis of established, uncompromised, unbroken virtue.

306
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:16,920
So, how do you uncompromise your virtue by overly defining your rules and sort of proliferating

307
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,760
aspects or by simply not accepting any action that your mind offers you out of greed, aversion,

308
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
delusion.

309
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,760
And you know that.

310
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,920
Am I acting out of hindrances? Am I acting out of doubt? Am I acting out of restlessness?

311
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Am I acting out of sensuality, anger, sloth and laziness? It's unwholesome. If I don't

312
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,560
do it, I am accomplished in virtue. So you will be abandoning hindrances as well, which

313
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
is what samadhi is.

314
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,560
And not acting out of unwholesome states, I mean we speak about it so often. And all

315
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,440
of that is contained between you and your relationship with your own virtue or lack of

316
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
it.

317
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,160
When I say lack of virtue, it doesn't mean you don't keep the precepts, it means you

318
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,180
keep them, but in that external celibar parama sense and you are not internally becoming

319
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,200
accomplished in those rules. In other words, you are not internalizing criteria for unwholesome

320
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,800
that you are avoiding, you are just adhering to the definition through your intellect,

321
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,000
tradition, authority and so on.

322
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,920
That if you don't have the clarity that comes from accomplishment or in virtue, you cannot

323
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:34,280
be mindful of the body. No, no, your mindfulness will be external in the same sense your responsibility

324
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,920
for your virtues is external. So when you do mindfulness, you will be doing it on the

325
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,400
level of objects of your senses, which is not mindfulness, will be like a duty. That's

326
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,960
exactly what meditation technique is for people. It's often taken in a sense of another external

327
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,640
duty that I must do and it's certainly always taken on the level of sense objects, observations,

328
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,680
nematiles and whatever else, movements, motions, it's never taken as the internal recitations,

329
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:07,440
recitations, mantras, visualizations, yeah, every and that's why it's taken there because

330
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,040
there's no basis for mindfulness, no sufficient basis for mindfulness to be taken on the right

331
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,280
peripheral, sufficiently peripheral context. So what happens then is just you take it where

332
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,920
your mind is and your mind is out there on the external things because you want to avoid

333
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,880
doubt and all these things. You're just adhering to external things with a sense of duty.

334
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:35,200
Sila Vata Paramasa. And then your meditation becomes on the level of that Sila Vata Paramasa.

335
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,360
And then your discernment is on that level. In other words, it's not a discernment. You're

336
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,520
discerning things more on the level of sense objects without having the right context,

337
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,840
the right basis for it. All because you have an larger self to become accomplished in that

338
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,600
virtue correctly, you haven't taken it up, you haven't accepted the weight of responsibility

339
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:21,040
for it and endured it.
