00:00.000 --> 00:21.920
So, a simple question, why is pain a problem, because I don't want it, I don't want it.

00:21.920 --> 00:26.200
So which is first, you don't want it, that's it's a problem, or it's a problem that's

00:26.200 --> 00:38.160
you don't want it? What is first, Mark? Yeah, sure, pain is not wanted, pain is a problem.

00:38.160 --> 00:49.080
Why is a pain a problem that's unwanted? Because I don't want it. So, you make it a

00:49.080 --> 01:02.280
problem, because you don't want it. So, if you stop resisting pain, as in stop trying

01:02.280 --> 01:11.560
to get rid of the pain, pain ceases to be a problem.

01:11.560 --> 01:25.080
Well, it depends what you mean by that, whether you mean too much of painfulness of the pain,

01:25.080 --> 01:31.440
in which case, well as long as you're still alive, it's not too much. Or you mean this

01:31.440 --> 01:38.720
is too much of a problem for me, so I don't want it. So, if you don't have a problem

01:38.720 --> 01:45.200
with pain, then there cannot be too much of a pain. And that's why we're going to get

01:45.200 --> 01:52.360
that example of highway robbers sawing your limbs one by one. And if the mind has ill

01:52.360 --> 02:01.480
willed towards them, it means it hasn't fulfilled the teaching. Because by fulfilling the dama,

02:01.480 --> 02:09.280
it's inconceivable to have ill will towards pain, or those who cause it. It is just inconceivable

02:09.280 --> 02:14.520
because it was not conceivable to begin with, but it was your ignorance of it, it was conceiving

02:14.520 --> 02:25.800
it. But again, back to the same simple question, which is a reflection anybody can do. Why

02:25.800 --> 02:36.000
is painful feeling a problem? Because I prefer pleasure. Yeah, so why would I prefer pleasure?

02:36.000 --> 02:46.280
It's not pain. Which is why, why is it better then? You realize you won't find an objective

02:46.280 --> 02:53.800
answer to it. You have an attitude of no wanting pain, and you have an attitude of wanting pleasure,

02:53.800 --> 02:58.200
and your whole life is dictated by that. But if you look at an attitude as to why is that

02:58.200 --> 03:05.880
attitude there, you won't find an answer. It's good to do attitude. And that's the only

03:05.880 --> 03:15.360
thing, the only one and only reason for human suffering of any kind. That's what it meant

03:15.360 --> 03:28.360
by craving means suffering. I want this, I don't want this. But even if even if a person

03:28.360 --> 03:35.280
just starts reflecting, don't jump into answering right away. So just why is pain any pain physical

03:35.280 --> 03:41.400
emotion or any pain? Any disagreeable feeling that I'm experiencing, why is it not wanted

03:41.400 --> 03:57.280
by default? Why is that my default attitude? And by putting yourself in such a question,

03:57.280 --> 04:03.640
without providing a rational answer, you're becoming aware of that problem, the problem

04:03.640 --> 04:10.800
of your attitude. And sometimes yes, sometimes maybe you have to keep that question for days

04:10.800 --> 04:15.320
as a way of contemplation. No, you have to keep repeating it. Just don't answer it. Keep

04:15.320 --> 04:20.840
asking yourself, but look for an answer, but don't answer it. So you're looking, but you

04:20.840 --> 04:25.600
are not allowing yourself to formulate it in the irrational, psychologicalism manner.

04:25.600 --> 04:32.160
Because you really want to become aware of that emotional level of your resistance to

04:32.160 --> 04:37.840
the unpleasant emotion. Yeah, you can give this answer to that answer, but emotionally,

04:37.840 --> 04:45.960
you'll still be resisting it, or you would still want to prolong it if it's pleasure.

04:45.960 --> 04:54.280
But there is absolutely no justifiable reason for not wanting pain. Because if your attitude

04:54.280 --> 05:02.880
towards your feelings matters, you would feel only what you want to feel. In other words,

05:02.880 --> 05:10.160
feelings would be obeying the attitude. But the fact that you're experiencing pain, which

05:10.160 --> 05:16.720
is not wanted, means you have absolutely no say in the domain of feeling. The domain

05:16.720 --> 05:25.240
of feeling is unaware of your resistance. Feeling, feelings feel, pleasant feeling feels

05:25.240 --> 05:29.960
pleasure, unpleasant feeling feels unpleasant pleasure, this pleasure. Neutral feeling feels

05:29.960 --> 05:38.800
neither. That's it. You don't exist for it. Your attitude is a self-assumed parasite

05:38.800 --> 05:46.600
upon it, because of which you suffer. Like the experience of pain does not experience

05:46.600 --> 05:53.000
the dukkha. The experience of pain, you're resisting it, you experience the dukkha. That's

05:53.000 --> 05:57.560
where you get to be free from suffering, and your sense of self, and the gratitude is assumption

05:57.560 --> 06:03.640
and everything else. But then pleasure, displeasure, and neutral remains. Because they have never

06:03.640 --> 06:12.120
a problem. Pain is inevitable. Well, exactly. Inasmuch as any feeling is inevitable for

06:12.120 --> 06:17.040
as long as you're alive. Either pleasure, displeasure, or neither pleasure nor displeasure.

06:17.040 --> 06:25.680
But the attitude is... Get you this. Yeah? Option. Well, it's not optional. It's either

06:25.680 --> 06:31.400
you have attitude or you have undone the attitude. It's not option. Maybe the type of attitude,

06:31.400 --> 06:37.600
but even the type of attitude is not optional. Because in pleasure, you will always be wanting

06:37.600 --> 06:42.040
more pleasure in pain. You will always want to try and get rid of it. In a neutral feeling,

06:42.040 --> 06:47.680
you're always going to distract yourself from it. So your attitude is determined by the craving.

06:47.680 --> 06:57.400
Pouring has set outcomes. What's optional is how you're going to go about it. But that's

06:57.400 --> 07:03.800
already far down the line. It's not fundamental. Fundamental is the attitude of wanting, no one.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.360
Fundamental is the attitude. Fundamental is craving. Craving for what? Well, craving for

07:07.360 --> 07:11.640
pleasure in what pleasure? Cream for more pleasure in pleasure. Craving for absence of pain in

07:11.640 --> 07:19.320
pain. Craving for distraction or pleasure in neither pleasure nor unpleasant feeling. But

07:19.320 --> 07:23.960
that attitude can become apparent if you start questioning yourself in regard to the presently

07:23.960 --> 07:28.520
enduring feeling. What am I feeling now? Whether something happened to you, somebody said something

07:28.520 --> 07:36.760
you're upset. Pain. Why do I need to... Well, first, you have to stop projecting the blame,

07:36.760 --> 07:44.680
so to speak, and responsibility onto the world for your pain. Because as long as you still think

07:44.680 --> 07:51.720
that I'm suffering because such and such person said this and this, you have a lot of work to

07:51.720 --> 07:58.520
do, basically, as in you have many views to undo. When you take responsibility for how you're

07:58.520 --> 08:03.520
feeling and stop blaming the world, then you might be able to start discerning your attitude

08:03.520 --> 08:09.120
in regard to your own feeling as a primary and only one and only source of your suffering.

08:10.400 --> 08:15.520
But obviously a person who is fully projected onto the world being the reason for my pain,

08:16.160 --> 08:19.040
they can never see that because they haven't taken responsibility for it.

08:24.960 --> 08:29.200
But say you've taken responsibility for you being affected by your feelings,

08:29.200 --> 08:41.280
so you stop trying to talk things out with somebody upset you. If that's sort of done to

08:41.280 --> 08:45.440
maintain social norms, that's fine. But you don't do it as a means of escape from your feeling.

08:46.560 --> 08:53.680
You recognize that responsibility for you being affected by what's being felt is when you.

08:53.680 --> 08:59.040
Not from the circumstances, not from the elements, not from other people, not of who said what,

08:59.040 --> 09:04.080
not of all the disrespect me enough or they didn't do this or they didn't do that, no.

09:04.080 --> 09:11.520
All of that is you took for granted the attitude of trying to get rid of this unpleasureable feeling

09:12.320 --> 09:17.280
and then where you look, where would you go about it? He said this, it's his fault.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.040
This happened, I didn't have enough luck, it's everyone else's fault.

09:21.040 --> 09:28.160
Even if people are genuinely rude and need to you, if you suffer and encounter it, that's on you.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.360
That's what it would have said, the wise mind, the one with the well wisdom and the right view,

09:35.360 --> 09:40.880
would endure harsh words, slander and all this, in the same sense you would endure elements,

09:40.880 --> 09:43.760
in the same sense you would endure heat called hunger,

09:43.760 --> 09:51.600
insect bites, slanderous and abusive words, because it's on the same level, it's just element.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.000
But you being upset and account of it, that's on you.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.120
So why is pain a problem?

10:04.800 --> 10:11.280
In order to reveal the attitude, your attitude that makes it a problem, that feeds the attitude,

10:11.280 --> 10:16.640
that makes it a problem, that feeds the attitude, vicious circle, in order to reveal it,

10:16.640 --> 10:21.920
you have to stop blaming pain for the problem, for the problem.

10:23.360 --> 10:29.440
So why is pain a problem? You realize, no, why do I have a problem with pain?

10:31.600 --> 10:36.720
That's a more accurate question, because pain in itself isn't the problem,

10:36.720 --> 10:42.560
but there is a problem in regard to the pain. Why is that? Because the pain is not wanted.

10:43.440 --> 10:48.640
Why? Why is the pain not wanted? Okay, I wanted it. Why would you want it?

10:49.360 --> 10:54.800
Why do you have to either want or not want? Why can you just be

10:54.800 --> 11:06.560
equanimous in regard to either? Okay, I don't want pain, but I do not want pain to either.

11:09.680 --> 11:16.560
Any pain, big or small, far and near, past, future, any attitude in regard to any pain.

11:16.560 --> 11:26.320
So if you stop trying to get rid of it, then the attitude towards pleasure becomes also apparent.

11:27.600 --> 11:33.680
Stop trying to entertain it, stop trying to make it so longer, stop trying to get more of it.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.200
So automatically, by discerning the nature of your attitude of its pain,

11:39.760 --> 11:44.480
you also start discerning the nature of your attitude towards pleasure, the gratuitous assumption

11:44.480 --> 11:52.400
of sensuality, sensual desire and pleasure you get from it. That doesn't mean you stop perceiving

11:52.400 --> 11:58.560
agreeable and disagreeable things, but that's one thing, another thing is craving for more of it

11:58.560 --> 12:06.960
and craving for their absence and craving for your distraction. So if a nature of pain ceases to

12:06.960 --> 12:16.880
be a problem for a person, there's nothing else to do because it doesn't matter where it comes from,

12:16.880 --> 12:23.280
from what sense, from what thought, from what experience, from what circumstance. Pain is not

12:23.280 --> 12:31.040
resisted, pain is not feared, pain is not wanted either, because sometimes people would go the

12:31.040 --> 12:37.200
other way and overly indulge pain as a mean of showing that you know. No, if pain is a reason,

12:38.560 --> 12:44.400
it doesn't matter, that's not a problem, it's a secondary thing. So if pain arises on the kind of

12:44.400 --> 12:49.120
your restraint and determination and willpower, you have no problem with it.

12:52.960 --> 12:59.120
If pain arises on the kind of somebody abusing you or fending you whatever,

12:59.120 --> 13:06.320
you have no problem with it either. But you don't allow yourself to be abused.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.640
Well, you allow yourself to be abused when you give in to the attitude of its pain,

13:10.640 --> 13:16.240
you become abused. That's the whole point. Because a lot of people think that.

13:16.240 --> 13:22.560
Like yeah, the circumstances are abusive, but you are not abused until you put the projection

13:22.560 --> 13:30.400
on the circumstances for that abuse. If you realize that abuse, that abuse is founded

13:30.400 --> 13:36.080
upon your attitude towards the experienced feeling in the time. So if that attitude is

13:36.080 --> 13:41.040
attitude of, I don't want this, you made yourself affected by that abuse.

13:42.160 --> 13:49.840
So I'm a sort of sexual abuse and sexual. Well, how can you be sexually abused? The body can be

13:49.840 --> 13:55.680
sexually abused, physically abused. But that's the kind of normal sexual relationship with people.

13:55.680 --> 14:00.480
Exactly, yeah. Which means that people go through this, they take the ownership of the body to be

14:00.480 --> 14:09.040
theirs. But we all know how that ends. Sickness, aging, and death. Which means it was a mistake to

14:09.040 --> 14:16.720
take it as yours. And you better undo that mistake while you're alive. And you reflect, if this body

14:16.720 --> 14:22.000
were truly mine. In the same sense, what I said, if the feelings were truly yours, your attitude

14:22.000 --> 14:27.200
would be the first and your feelings would be determined by it. Not your attitude would be

14:27.200 --> 14:34.080
determined by the corresponding feeling that has arisen. Means, oh, so my attitude is secondary to

14:34.080 --> 14:41.920
this, yet it's acting like it's some sort of commander in chief. So me resisting pain

14:41.920 --> 14:48.000
is my attitude towards the reason pain, which has arisen on its own. So if I were to develop the

14:48.000 --> 14:52.160
attitude of, hold on, that's not a problem. And I stopped gratuitous to resisting it,

14:53.280 --> 14:58.480
you wouldn't be able to suffer. In the same sense, the body gets somebody attached to beat you up

14:58.480 --> 15:09.840
physically. That's one thing. But you, through gratuitous assumption of the ownership of that body,

15:09.840 --> 15:17.840
that's how you become beaten up and abused. Doesn't matter what type of

15:17.840 --> 15:21.680
assault and abuse it is, the point is it can be done only to the body,

15:22.960 --> 15:28.240
only to the, literally to this bag of, bag of skin filled with lots of other organs and things.

15:28.240 --> 15:40.880
And you thinking that you have a say, ultimate say in what befalls that body, well, that was

15:40.880 --> 15:49.120
your ignorance from the start. So even if you never get physically abused, you will be abused,

15:49.120 --> 15:56.080
your body will be abused by aging, sickness and death. That's the ultimate abuse. No matter

15:56.080 --> 16:03.920
physical abuse, if it doesn't kill you, can amount for the abuse of death. That is inevitable for

16:03.920 --> 16:12.240
everyone. But if you realize that the attitude of abuse comes from you accepting the ownership

16:12.240 --> 16:18.560
of the body that has been abused, and you accept it through wanting pleasure, through it, and you

16:18.560 --> 16:26.000
accept it through wanting to get rid of the pain through it. So it comes down again to the

16:26.000 --> 16:30.800
to the feelings that are present. It's unpleasant feeling of abuse.

16:34.960 --> 16:39.520
And you don't even think twice before you start blaming the feeling what happened to the body

16:39.520 --> 16:46.640
and everything else. But if you had enough mindfulness and self-reflection, you realized that,

16:47.680 --> 16:51.040
yeah, it's unfortunate, but that's the subject of elements.

16:51.040 --> 16:59.040
A form is being deformed by elements, by other bodies, other things. That's just nature of life,

16:59.040 --> 17:04.720
by sickness, aging, death, whatever, accidents, that's the nature of it.

17:07.120 --> 17:13.600
And it was actually my mistake to assume that I had the say in that domain to gratuitously

17:13.600 --> 17:21.200
entertain the attitude of saying no to this, or saying yes, I want more of this, whereby I have

17:21.200 --> 17:26.000
no say in the rising of those things. How can I have a say in prolonging it or not arising in the

17:26.000 --> 17:40.800
first place? How can you have a say in not wanting a rising of pain when any attitude towards pain

17:40.800 --> 17:52.400
requires pain first? That's why it's unpleasant. That's why you suffer because of the discrepancy,

17:52.400 --> 17:58.160
not because of the pain. Suffering is the discrepancy that your attitude creates in regard to the

17:58.160 --> 18:06.400
present feeling. So if the feeling is pleasurable, you suffer when you want more of it. And the

18:06.400 --> 18:13.520
discrepancy there is pleasant feeling and wanting more of it, as in not enough of it. But if you

18:13.520 --> 18:17.920
were to stop wanting more of it, then you're only going to have a pleasant feeling. So there's no

18:17.920 --> 18:25.120
discrepancy, no suffering. Consequently, you have the unpleasant feeling present, pain is present,

18:25.760 --> 18:32.720
and you don't want that presence at all, which means you're overdoing it now. There is some pain,

18:32.720 --> 18:38.320
but your attitude does not want any of it. And that's another discrepancy you created it.

18:38.320 --> 18:44.880
Because there is pain. Because there is pain, exactly. If all you had is your attitude towards pain,

18:44.880 --> 18:50.480
you would be in control. But no, there is the actual pain there. And it's your attitude that

18:50.480 --> 18:59.440
contradicts it. No, this pain must not be while the pain is. Oh, this pleasure must be greater,

18:59.440 --> 19:06.800
while it isn't. There's a neutral feeling. This neutral feeling, what neutral feeling?

19:07.440 --> 19:11.360
But there is a neutral feeling, but you're not seeing any neutral feeling. That's an

19:11.360 --> 19:18.560
discrepancy. That's why when you're bored, you feel unpleasant. When you're bored,

19:18.560 --> 19:24.240
basically, you feel neither pleasure nor pleasure, but that in itself, it's unpleasant for you.

19:24.240 --> 19:30.800
You want to feel something because a threshold of your discernment of feeling is pain and pleasure.

19:30.800 --> 19:37.440
You don't even see the neutral one. And that's why it's unpleasant. So it's a slightly subtle

19:37.440 --> 19:42.960
discrepancy, but nevertheless, it's a discrepancy. Probably you know it's presence. You know neutral.

19:42.960 --> 19:47.520
Then you stop contradicting it. No contradiction, no discrepancy, no discrepancy, no suffering.

19:47.520 --> 19:54.960
Suffering is a discrepancy created when your attitude clashes with the world, basically.

19:56.720 --> 20:03.120
A world can present itself only in three forms, agreeable, disagreeable, and neutral.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.680
And if you deal on that level, you don't have to worry about anything else more particular than that.

20:09.680 --> 20:23.280
So how to deal with it in that level? If you take responsibility for what I was being felt,

20:24.080 --> 20:31.680
as in, this is felt by me because of my attitude towards it,

20:32.640 --> 20:36.560
I'm making the feeling affect me, feeling of pleasure, feeling of pain,

20:36.560 --> 20:46.160
neutral feeling. So if somebody says something upsetting and the pain arises, that pain

20:46.880 --> 20:52.880
is not in what's being said. It's not in that person. It's not in any of the circumstances.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.760
It's in your attitude in regard to the circumstances.

20:59.120 --> 21:03.520
So you have to take responsibility for suffering, basically. You don't have to take responsibility

21:03.520 --> 21:08.560
for agreeable and disagreeable, but you have to take responsibility for wanting agreeable

21:08.560 --> 21:13.040
and not wanting disagreeable. What do you mean by taking responsibility?

21:13.040 --> 21:20.000
It means seeing that it's on you. There is no excuse. It's my doing. I'm responsible for this.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.640
So when I suffer, I'm responsible for that. Only through that attitude, you can actually

21:24.640 --> 21:31.760
get a glimpse at least and maybe even go through with it. You can figure out how to not suffer.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.800
But for as long as your attitude doesn't take on suffering

21:36.800 --> 21:42.800
as your responsibility and conflates suffering with disagreeable circumstances,

21:42.800 --> 21:47.200
with painful circumstances, you're not going to see the nature of suffering, how can you free yourself

21:47.200 --> 21:55.760
from it. So you have to stop blaming painful circumstances for your suffering. Suffering is

21:55.760 --> 22:03.920
not pain. So there is pain without suffering, but they cannot be suffering without pain.

22:07.280 --> 22:11.920
So if you remove your attitude of denial and try to get rid of the pain,

22:12.960 --> 22:21.760
you won't suffer. If you remove your attitude and indulgent in regard to the pleasure, you won't

22:21.760 --> 22:28.480
suffer. You won't suffer on account of either pleasure or pain or neutrophil.

22:31.680 --> 22:37.840
Well, this attitude is maintained through non-knowing it, through gratuitously,

22:38.640 --> 22:46.480
assuming it at face value. And I've heard that. Exactly. Well, that's all you can do. You can't

22:46.480 --> 22:53.120
decide to stop. Okay, now I will stop trying to get rid of the feeling of unpleasure. That's

22:53.120 --> 22:59.040
impossible. But understanding your attitude towards it, that attitude is being gradually

22:59.040 --> 23:05.600
cancelled out. I feel pain. I feel pain. Mind jumps to blame the circumstances. You recognize that.

23:05.600 --> 23:11.120
Wait a minute. How many times has this happened? How many times will it happen? Do I have a say

23:11.120 --> 23:20.400
in circumstances? No. Why do I then keep sort of like inflaming myself with this attitude of

23:20.400 --> 23:26.400
yeah, this or this or that person? Well, it's just, it just fits the five further. While I kind of

23:26.400 --> 23:31.360
know already that that's not the problem. That's really like indignation and anger and

23:31.360 --> 23:42.320
the constant maintenance, the constant action to make it valid. Constant blame. Find the scapegoat

23:42.320 --> 23:50.560
for this. Cheers for it. Is that false? Who's going to pay for this? Yeah, there are mistakes

23:50.560 --> 23:57.200
and people do things that run wise and they're responsible for that. But if you suffer on account

23:57.200 --> 24:04.160
of it, that responsibility is solely yours. Everybody is sick. Sickness. That kind of pain.

24:05.520 --> 24:11.360
The sickness is true. Yeah, you have to kind of, you know, sort yourself out there. Yeah, that's all

24:11.360 --> 24:17.360
fine. You can be managing the circumstances. But you don't want to be doing it out of trying to

24:17.360 --> 24:24.320
get rid of the suffering because that inquires you identifying suffering with disagreeable

24:24.320 --> 24:31.920
circumstances of an alien body. And how do you know whether you're acting out of it or not?

24:31.920 --> 24:37.600
Well, ask yourself, what if I don't take the medicine? What if I don't go and see the doctor?

24:37.600 --> 24:42.640
Am I going to get filled with anxiety and fear in regard to this? Am I going to suffer?

24:43.600 --> 24:49.680
Am I going to experience mental anguish, basically? If the answer is yes, means you are still

24:49.680 --> 24:54.480
conflating suffering with circumstances. Well, you can't just give up the medicines.

24:55.120 --> 24:59.440
No, no. Well, then you realize whether you give up the medicines or not. That's not the problem.

25:02.240 --> 25:08.320
The problem is you confusing your suffering with disagreeable feeling. There has a reason on the

25:08.320 --> 25:15.440
level of an alien body. But you are making it into your mental anguish because of the

25:15.440 --> 25:20.640
gratuitous attitude of trying to get rid of it. So then you can take a step further and reflect.

25:20.640 --> 25:25.040
Okay, so this is the work that needs to be done in order to do their work. I need to stay alive,

25:25.040 --> 25:33.440
so I'll take the medicine. That's like properly reflecting. Then you take the medicine as like

25:33.440 --> 25:38.080
a bottle in the time so that you cannot upload the problem. But you don't take the medicine out of

25:38.080 --> 25:46.400
that blind sort of just jump into it. I'm sick, fear, deal with it. Okay, and then I'll practice.

25:46.400 --> 25:50.400
You've got to look after your tools. Yeah, of course, of course, exactly.

25:51.600 --> 25:55.360
The bodies are two on a kind of which you can understand the nature of the body,

25:56.000 --> 26:02.560
the nature of not ownership and so on. And for that, you need it. Keep it in a suitable.

26:02.560 --> 26:07.040
So that's what we'll say. He wisely avoids a wild elephant, the one who prays it down. He

26:07.040 --> 26:12.560
wisely avoids a snake, a child called Pitt while a pack of dogs because he would be foolish

26:12.560 --> 26:16.640
before he has completed the work to ignore the fact that this might kill him.

26:20.400 --> 26:24.800
But you don't go around with an attitude of health is good in itself,

26:25.680 --> 26:30.000
as in the health is the greatest value, where you're going to be solely disappointed.

26:30.000 --> 26:40.720
So health is basically a tool. And then you realize, okay, my health's not perfect, but the

26:40.720 --> 26:49.280
tool is still good enough. And you can also then realize that you're able to go quite far with

26:49.280 --> 26:54.400
the attitude of it's good enough because it is good enough. And it comes down to what as long

26:54.400 --> 27:00.480
as I'm still alive. And you know, my senses are still there. It's still good enough, even if you

27:00.480 --> 27:10.480
are in pain and discomfort. You don't have to go and seek out intense feelings.

27:11.120 --> 27:15.120
No, absolutely not. Of course not. It's going to change my attitude.

27:17.040 --> 27:23.520
Why would you do that? Like if somebody has a thought, where would that action intention be

27:23.520 --> 27:30.960
rooted? Fear of suffering. Right there and then. So you realize, I don't need to go out because

27:30.960 --> 27:36.000
I just now reveal to myself that I'm trying to get rid of the suffering by thinking I'll go out

27:36.000 --> 27:40.640
and do this and this. And that's where you get rid of the suffering, where you recognize your

27:40.640 --> 27:45.520
attitude in regard to the disagreeable feeling, which is always, well, there's a feeling always

27:45.520 --> 27:54.160
present. So yeah, so the work is always present. The work is always present in the sense of being

27:54.160 --> 27:59.120
mindful of the attitude towards the present feeling. And in order to be mindful of the present feeling,

27:59.120 --> 28:03.520
you have to stop blaming the circumstances for the arising of that feeling. You have to take

28:03.520 --> 28:08.720
responsibility for it. You have to be you have to feel it basically. You have to allow it to be felt,

28:08.720 --> 28:12.160
but I'm not trying to get rid of it. Mindful of the craving, the attitude.

28:12.160 --> 28:16.800
Well, you can't be mindful of the craving, as I'm craving and craving and craving,

28:16.800 --> 28:23.120
you can be mindful of the feeling and then discern the nature of it. Like, well, can I, as I said,

28:23.680 --> 28:28.160
my attitude is always second to this. It's inconceivable to be different.

28:30.720 --> 28:36.320
Once that which you have been prioritized, which you have been prioritizing is seen as second,

28:36.320 --> 28:44.000
and it's not a priority anymore. And if that attitude is not a priority, that's how the attitude

28:44.000 --> 28:50.720
starts to fade. So to be mindful of the enduring feeling, you get to discern the nature of the

28:50.720 --> 28:56.240
feeling. That's why mindfulness is the basis of knowledge, or like pain of restraint, saying

28:56.240 --> 29:02.880
no to yourself, saying no to sensual indulgence, saying no to laziness, saying no to your will,

29:02.880 --> 29:10.400
acting out of will, it produces pain. Because there's that discrepancy of I want to do this,

29:10.400 --> 29:19.280
but you say no. But again, where is that discrepancy really rooted? Is it rooted in you want this and

29:19.280 --> 29:24.560
saying no to it? Or is it rooted in you want this saying no to this? That's experienced

29:24.560 --> 29:36.240
disagreeably that you don't want. So circumstances arising, say like a prospect of ill will,

29:36.240 --> 29:41.040
but you restrain yourself as a result of that, you're experiencing this pain now, unpleasant

29:41.040 --> 29:47.840
feeling. That's what you're resisting. So circumstances were not a problem.

29:47.840 --> 29:58.320
Even wanting to act out of it wasn't a problem. It became a problem when circumstances, they were

29:58.320 --> 30:06.160
unpleasant. You wanted to get rid of the displeasure through affecting the circumstances. That's why

30:06.160 --> 30:12.880
you go and shout, beat people up, threaten them. So they never ever say that to you again.

30:12.880 --> 30:20.560
But if you were not affected by the feeling of what's being said, how could you even conceive

30:20.560 --> 30:26.880
act of ill will? And same as we spoke in many other talks sensuality as well. The first

30:29.920 --> 30:34.640
relationship with central prospect of every mind that's universal is pain.

30:34.640 --> 30:42.000
That's why sensuality is so intoxicating because it's felt very unpleasantly.

30:42.800 --> 30:48.000
And if you give into it, not just that you avoid that, well, that you cover up that pain,

30:48.000 --> 30:51.120
but you get more pleasure out of it. So it feels like a double pleasure.

30:53.200 --> 30:57.760
But you realize that sensuality is maintained and people go with say, you know,

30:57.760 --> 31:04.080
I'll follow the tastes or sexuality or just just careless indulgence of the senses

31:04.720 --> 31:12.880
because it's very painful when the prospect of central indulgence presents itself,

31:13.680 --> 31:21.040
it's felt very painfully to not give in. And automatically you blame your attitude of

31:21.040 --> 31:26.400
not giving in for the pain. But you realize, wait a minute, my attitude is a negative attitude.

31:26.400 --> 31:32.800
Like I'm not doing anything. Negative attitude. Negative attitude means sensuality has a reason,

31:32.800 --> 31:38.000
hey, go and eat all these cakes that you want now. That's a thought. So you're not actually

31:38.000 --> 31:43.840
eating the cakes, which means you're still not doing anything. So your response is a negative

31:43.840 --> 31:49.360
response. Not a bad response. Not a bad response in a negative like, oh, it's bad. No, it means

31:49.360 --> 31:56.880
it's basically not a positive action. It's a call to a positive action. Go and get these cakes and

31:56.880 --> 32:03.840
eat them and enjoy the sense of taste you get from it. Now, all of that is still your thought

32:04.560 --> 32:10.560
and you're not eating it. You're not making any effort. So it's a negative experience. It's

32:10.560 --> 32:19.920
absence of these cakes. They will provide me with these great pleasures. And that's the pain of it.

32:21.040 --> 32:26.400
It's because of your attitude that always welcomes greater pleasure from the

32:26.400 --> 32:32.720
currently experienced feeling. So then the prospect of greater pleasure immediately

32:32.720 --> 32:40.720
is experienced as that great discrepancy. And then people would give in, go and get all these cakes

32:40.720 --> 32:46.800
and overeat and whatnot, because they want to avoid the pain in the first place.

32:50.240 --> 32:56.640
But can you really avoid as in, can you really prevent the pain in the first place by doing that?

32:56.640 --> 33:03.760
Or can you just covering it up and distract yourself from it? And you realize you can't avoid it.

33:04.560 --> 33:10.000
You realize it by giving in value to the joy that comes out of taste,

33:10.000 --> 33:15.840
treating all these cakes in this example, you gave in the value, you confirmed that you were

33:15.840 --> 33:21.680
affected by it in the first place by that pain of not having that centrality.

33:21.680 --> 33:30.080
So as we said before, people think sensuality is unpleasant because they say no to it.

33:38.080 --> 33:43.520
But it's out of the way around. Through saying no to sensuality, you realize that the pain

33:43.520 --> 33:49.680
that you've been attributing to you saying no as in not giving in to the positive action.

33:49.680 --> 33:53.760
The pain of it is basically in that positive action.

33:54.480 --> 33:59.200
So if you want to get rid of sensuality and pain of sensuality and dependence and pressure

33:59.200 --> 34:05.440
and burden and all of it, you just need to stick to saying no to it. And then the nature of it will

34:05.440 --> 34:10.800
become apparent. Because you're not doing anything, you're not doing anything now.

34:11.680 --> 34:18.720
And the thought of sensuality comes. But restraint is closer to the natural state you were before.

34:18.720 --> 34:25.120
You were not doing anything. But it's the thought of sensuality that pressures you to go and do it.

34:27.360 --> 34:32.240
And the pain arises on account of that. That's the discrepancy that's been created.

34:34.880 --> 34:38.480
Because you want to do anything before sensuality and you're not doing anything

34:38.480 --> 34:45.360
when you're restraining sensuality. So that's the constant there. What has changed is absence

34:45.360 --> 34:51.600
of sensuality before the pain and then presence of sensuality when the pain is there.

34:52.480 --> 34:58.480
So you realize wait a minute. It's the presence or absence of sensuality. Craving for that pleasure,

35:00.720 --> 35:05.200
that's what creates the discrepancy of pain, of suffering on account of sensuality.

35:05.200 --> 35:11.440
Not mighty strain. Mighty strain is more like emulation of the proper behavior,

35:11.440 --> 35:18.960
of the proper action, of the action that doesn't give in to the pressure of sensuality or the

35:18.960 --> 35:24.480
oriole burness on. That's why the restraint, self-composure virtue has to come first.

35:24.480 --> 35:31.040
Because it starts emulating things rightly. You don't know it yet. But on that ground you can get to know it.

35:31.040 --> 35:45.120
So inevitably pain is going to be felt when you send out to sensuality and you have to accept it.

35:46.560 --> 35:52.800
Once you accept it, then you can say basically to the pain and to yourself that that pain belongs

35:52.800 --> 36:00.480
to the sensuality, not to the restraint of it. Because as I said restraint, it's no action there.

36:01.440 --> 36:06.720
It's abstaining from action. So you've been abstaining from sensuality when there

36:06.720 --> 36:11.200
was no sensuality pressuring you. Now sensuality is pressuring you. You're practicing restraint.

36:11.760 --> 36:18.320
Again, you're on the same level of abstaining from that action. Yet there is pain. What's different?

36:18.320 --> 36:24.240
It's absence or presence of sensuality. And then it becomes even more apparent. The one thing for

36:24.240 --> 36:30.880
sure, you'll never find peace and like ultimate freedom in the sense of not being pressured by

36:30.880 --> 36:41.120
circumstances. If you keep engaging with sensuality, with gratuitous cravings of pleasure through

36:41.120 --> 36:51.680
senses, with gratuitous expressions of your ill will through your senses. So whether sensuality

36:51.680 --> 36:57.040
touches you, whether ill will touches you, whether boredom touches you, what they're having common

36:57.920 --> 37:07.200
pain. It's a disagreeable experience. Having an attitude of wanting to get rid of disagreeable

37:07.200 --> 37:14.960
means what? In sensuality, how do you get rid of disagreeable by saying yes to it?

37:17.600 --> 37:24.240
In ill will, how do you get rid of the disagreeable by affecting the person or whatever circumstances

37:24.240 --> 37:30.160
by saying yes to it? Exactly. In boredom, how do you get rid of disagreeable by saying yes to it

37:30.160 --> 37:35.280
and finding things to distract yourself from it? Either way, you have a positive attitude

37:35.280 --> 37:42.080
that result in positive actions of indulgence, ill will, distraction, greed, aversion, delusion,

37:43.120 --> 37:47.920
not metaphysical things, they're things that your attitudes are based on, your actions are based on

37:48.800 --> 37:51.200
because of your attitude in regard to how you're feeling.

37:55.680 --> 38:00.400
So from that point of view, that's what I'm going to meant. Whatever it's felt counts as suffering

38:00.400 --> 38:08.480
because feeling of agreeable pressures you, feeling of disagreeable pressures you,

38:09.120 --> 38:16.640
feeling of mutual pressures you. But again, that pressure is not in the feeling or on the feeling,

38:16.640 --> 38:22.320
that pressure is in your ignorance of it. So you are pressured in regard to pleasure

38:22.320 --> 38:27.120
because you haven't understood it. You are pressured in regard to this pleasure because you haven't

38:27.120 --> 38:33.360
understood it. Same goes for the neutral feeling. And that's exactly what I said. If the neutral

38:33.360 --> 38:38.560
feeling is not understood, it's felt unpleasantly, pressure is there. If the neutral feeling is

38:38.560 --> 38:50.320
understood, there is no pressure, it's felt pleasantly. So you want sensuality in order to be free from

38:50.320 --> 38:58.080
pain. You have ill, will and anger in order to be free from pain. You have distraction, boredom,

38:58.080 --> 39:05.520
indolence, laziness in order to be free from pain. Wanting to be free from pain?

39:09.680 --> 39:13.680
If you stop equating that with trying to get rid of this pain,

39:13.680 --> 39:19.440
then you can actually learn how to free yourself from pain, from being affected by pain.

39:22.800 --> 39:28.240
So you will truly be free from pain, not when pain stops arising, but when your attitude

39:30.640 --> 39:39.280
to both pain changes. So that's again just to also add to what you said, you don't have to go out

39:39.280 --> 39:45.840
seeking out suffering and pain. Just say no to your desires and the pain is there. You don't

39:45.840 --> 39:50.000
need to go and risk your life and feel threatened and get, you know, that existential dread going.

39:50.000 --> 39:57.520
Just start saying no to your daily sense desires and you'll see how quickly the pain will come

39:57.520 --> 40:06.400
knocking on your door. If the attitude is developed towards pain is not a problem, it's my attitude

40:06.400 --> 40:13.600
towards pain that's a problem. Then no amount of pain can prevail over the mind. That's what

40:13.600 --> 40:20.000
it will meant for an out of hunt. The disagreeable feelings cannot overwhelm his mind. He is the one

40:20.000 --> 40:26.400
who overwhelms, his mind overwhelms the disagreeable feelings. Well, he is in one who overwhelms his

40:26.400 --> 40:30.960
mind in regard to disagreeable feelings. And that's not just that he needs to do that. It's like

40:30.960 --> 40:37.360
there's some sort of, you know, a determination sort of willpower practice. No, to understanding

40:37.360 --> 40:43.680
that's just the natural state of affairs. When disagreeable arises, he has a reason overwhelmed

40:43.680 --> 40:51.120
by the mind that has understood it. Basically understanding overwhelms the disagreeable.

40:51.120 --> 40:56.320
Presence of understanding automatically is higher than disagreeable or agreeable or neutral.

40:56.320 --> 41:01.440
So no, none of those feelings can overwhelm it anymore. Because it's not on the level of just

41:01.440 --> 41:07.680
I'm doing this, it's on the level of this thing, this pain that's there, there is the understanding

41:07.680 --> 41:17.120
of that pain that's there simultaneously with that pain. Understanding. You understand what's there?

41:17.760 --> 41:21.840
So that understanding depends on what's there. But whenever that thing is there, it has been

41:21.840 --> 41:30.960
understood right there and then because it's there. No, because you theorize about it and

41:30.960 --> 41:35.040
rationalize about it. No, it's because it's there. That's what's been understood. Presence of that

41:35.040 --> 41:42.080
thing, presence of agreeable feeling, presence of disagreeable feeling. And there's just another

41:42.080 --> 41:49.280
way of saying there is no more attitude. There is no more assumed, almost entitled, attitude

41:49.280 --> 41:57.200
in regard to pleasure, pain, or neutral. So then pleasure feels pleasantly,

41:58.320 --> 42:04.080
displeasure feels unpleasantly, and neutral feelings need feels neutrally, and there is no

42:04.080 --> 42:23.040
suffering in regard to any.

42:23.040 --> 42:35.120
So we started by saying, why is pain a problem? But why am I making a problem out of pain?

42:35.120 --> 42:43.520
Same. Why am I making a problem out of pleasure? Well, I'm not making a problem where you are

42:44.480 --> 42:52.000
because you are pressured by it. If pleasure is truly not a problem, you wouldn't suffer on a

42:52.000 --> 42:57.200
kind of knot getting enough of it. Whichever shape or form pleasure would arise,

42:58.960 --> 43:04.960
it would be self-sufficient to that extent. It means there would be no craving for more

43:04.960 --> 43:14.080
essential pleasure. So you have a thought of, as we said, of going and eating up all the nice

43:14.080 --> 43:22.480
sweet cakes. That thought is agreeable. It's nice, nice cakes, nice, nice taste.

43:25.840 --> 43:32.160
But that's it. In itself, that's efficient. Why would not that thought pressure you to go and

43:32.160 --> 43:37.600
make all these actions of finding cake, getting cake, eating cake, consuming cake, all of that?

43:37.600 --> 43:44.640
That means you were affected by that pleasure on the level of your thought.

43:47.280 --> 43:53.280
Because you were affected, the only means of you dealing with being pressured and experiencing

43:53.280 --> 44:00.000
disagreeable is seeking out what it sort of points at, at the cake, at the mouth and eating,

44:00.000 --> 44:08.160
shoving cake in your mouth, all that. But all that secondary to the thought of that pleasure of the

44:08.160 --> 44:13.200
taste. But if you were indifferent to the pleasure of the taste on the level of the thought,

44:14.320 --> 44:18.800
committing actions on account of it becomes inconceivable. There doesn't mean that you don't

44:18.800 --> 44:27.440
recognize this is a tasty cake and this is not a tasty food. But none of that experience can then

44:27.440 --> 44:36.800
almost like facilitate further actions for its own sake. That's why central craving and central

44:36.800 --> 44:46.400
pleasure always remains bound with the level of the thought. Because the only reason you'll be

44:46.400 --> 44:53.200
going there and doing this and eating it because the context of the thought of consuming a tasty

44:53.200 --> 44:58.000
food is still there, giving the meaning to all of your individual actions of getting there.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.840
That's why once you go and eat the cake, you never can fulfill that thought. Because thought

45:03.840 --> 45:09.280
is a thought and taste is a taste. It's a completely different sense. But you were assuming this

45:09.280 --> 45:16.160
identity of the whole projection, the whole action. Thoughts of a pleasant taste, consumption of the

45:16.160 --> 45:22.160
pleasant taste, it's identified. But deep down, it isn't and you know that. And that's obvious

45:22.160 --> 45:27.200
to everyone. Everybody will say, people who never read Buddhism, yeah, you know, can't really satisfy

45:27.200 --> 45:35.840
your desires, can't you? Because there's nothing to satisfy. There was a pleasure, initial pleasure

45:35.840 --> 45:43.040
on the level of the thought. That's it. But it's your attitude that automatically wants more pleasure

45:43.040 --> 45:53.200
so you think more about it. That wants more pleasure so you go and do something about it.

45:53.200 --> 46:00.080
So again, it's attitude of wanting more pleasure in regard to the thought of pleasure. That's the

46:00.080 --> 46:06.240
discrepancy that's been created there. So that attitude is why you suffer. That attitude is why

46:06.240 --> 46:24.160
you assume the whole world of sensuality. But if you undo the attitude of automatically wanting

46:24.160 --> 46:30.240
pleasure and automatically not wanting pain, then you have an agreeable thought of

46:30.240 --> 46:39.360
some nice, very tasty food or agreeable thought of some beautiful music or agreeable thought

46:39.360 --> 46:45.200
of beautiful sights. That's it. They're just beautiful things that you thought about.

46:47.680 --> 46:53.600
And that agreeability of them stays with them. There is no attitude of you, I want more of this.

46:53.600 --> 47:02.240
And that's why in the thought, they will be only the thought. In the sight, they will be only the

47:02.240 --> 47:08.640
sight. In the sound, you hear something pleasant. That pleasure is confined to that pleasure.

47:10.320 --> 47:16.640
Because you don't interfere with it through your attitude of wanting more of it. You don't interfere

47:16.640 --> 47:22.000
with it through your attitude of trying to get rid of it. So in the scene, they've just been

47:22.000 --> 47:25.520
the scene in the herd. They've just been heard the bakhi sutta, the famous bahai sutta.

47:27.280 --> 47:30.160
Now because you got so absorbed in the scene that there's only the scene,

47:31.120 --> 47:36.560
no, it's because in the scene, there can only be the scene. You can't have the something else in

47:36.560 --> 47:43.280
the scene. No, if it's there, it's seen. You can't have the herd in the scene or the thought in the scene.

47:45.840 --> 47:50.720
In as much you can't have the scene in the thought. And that's what I'm saying here. That's

47:50.720 --> 47:57.120
why sensuality is on the level of the mind. And that's what I said for even for the Tagata,

47:57.120 --> 48:03.440
the beautiful things remain in the world. But it's the desire and lust his thought and desire

48:03.440 --> 48:06.880
and lust that's been perpetuated through it. That's what he has uprooted.

48:06.880 --> 48:22.240
So a thought of central pleasure is agreeable on the level of the thought.

48:26.000 --> 48:33.360
And you recognize that is the extent of his gratification, that initial

48:33.360 --> 48:40.480
agreeability. That's as much as you can get from him. So if you remove the attitude of

48:40.480 --> 48:45.520
its wanting more of it, you remove any basis for spreading of sensuality.

48:47.600 --> 48:51.920
If there is no spreading of sensuality, sensuality will cease because it requires maintenance.

48:53.360 --> 48:57.040
A vision requires maintenance. Ignorance requires maintenance.

48:57.040 --> 49:07.840
Your will, if there is a thought of, I've been offended, he said something rude to me,

49:07.840 --> 49:15.440
or all these people might come and kill me. If you're not trying to get rid of the displeasure

49:15.440 --> 49:20.400
of that thought, you won't be affected by anything that happens through that thought.

49:20.400 --> 49:25.200
And you certainly won't be able to engage with anything and wholesome.

49:28.880 --> 49:31.440
That's why you wouldn't be able to kill somebody even in self-defense.

49:32.240 --> 49:40.080
You just wouldn't. There's nothing to defend.

49:40.080 --> 49:49.520
So why is pain not wanted and why is pleasure wanted?

49:53.040 --> 49:57.120
So it's not about getting rid of the pleasure or having more of it. It's not about getting rid

49:57.120 --> 50:03.200
of the pain making it never appear. It's about not wanting one and not trying to get rid of the

50:03.200 --> 50:04.160
other. That's it.

50:04.160 --> 50:13.440
Now you can't say, you have a thought, as we said, or eating some tasty food.

50:15.040 --> 50:20.480
And then you're full on chugging food down, down, down your throat, just swallowing it

50:21.200 --> 50:24.640
and saying to yourself, but see, I don't want it on the level of my thought.

50:25.520 --> 50:28.400
That's inconceivable. That's a contradiction in terms.

50:28.400 --> 50:35.040
That's why we said it's impossible to engage physically with sensuality without having

50:35.040 --> 50:38.480
central perceptions on the level of thought. You just can't.

50:41.040 --> 50:44.080
Hence the sensory strain, the physical restraint needs to come first.

50:46.720 --> 50:52.800
Because it's based on the wrong discrepancy. So to engage in with it, you're affirming the

50:52.800 --> 50:59.760
discrepancy. If you're affirming the discrepancy, you're affirming suffering. How can you get rid

50:59.760 --> 51:25.600
of suffering when you're affirming it through your own very actions?

51:25.600 --> 51:31.920
You're building up on suffering. You take suffering as your temptation.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.040
Yeah, exactly.

51:35.600 --> 51:40.320
Which means any of your efforts can all really pretend to suffering, to undoing of it,

51:42.960 --> 51:44.480
but trying to cover it up.

51:45.040 --> 51:51.600
Trying to get rid of it. But trying to get rid of it is perpetuation of the attitude that

51:51.600 --> 51:56.080
creates the problem. That's where meant your attitude creates the problem and problem perpetuates

51:57.280 --> 52:03.280
once created. But there is no first point where that problem wasn't created and wasn't before.

52:03.280 --> 52:04.720
There's no first point to a vision.

52:10.880 --> 52:16.720
Or you can just think about pain as we started. Because if you remove the attitude of not wanting

52:16.720 --> 52:22.400
pain, you're automatically dealing with sensuality, with pleasure, and with pain, and with your will.

52:25.520 --> 52:29.760
Because you would give in to sensuality because it's unpleasant to not do so.

52:32.240 --> 52:39.040
So the way of getting rid of that displeasure is by doing so. But what if you're not affected by

52:39.040 --> 52:44.720
that displeasure in the first place? Can you realize, oh, there's nothing for me to get rid of? There's

52:44.720 --> 52:49.600
nothing for me to get engaged with.

52:55.520 --> 52:58.240
And sensuality is pleasant once you're given in to it.

53:02.080 --> 53:06.640
But you want to look as to why did you have to give in to it? Because it was painful.

53:06.640 --> 53:13.440
And everybody knows that.

53:19.440 --> 53:23.840
So that's what we spoke before, like the willpower and so on. That's where you should use willpower.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.240
Not like saying no to everything and overcoming and making it like, you know,

53:28.240 --> 53:34.480
prevailing over every single note. Just find things on account of which you suffer,

53:34.480 --> 53:38.240
which is your attitude in regard to pleasure, your attitude in regard to pain,

53:39.200 --> 53:44.960
your attitude in regard to neither pleasure nor pain. And yeah, prevail there, that's it.

53:46.400 --> 53:50.960
You don't have to worry about anything else then. Because whatever you do won't be unwholesome,

53:50.960 --> 53:53.040
because it's not rooted in trying to get rid of pain.

53:55.840 --> 53:57.680
It's not rooted in the discrepancy.

53:57.680 --> 54:06.560
Hence, it's our own ignorance and our own actions rooted in it that are perpetuating it,

54:06.560 --> 54:09.440
that is obscuring the nature of things as they actually are.

54:13.840 --> 54:20.080
So you remove your discrepant attitude or attitude that results in discrepancy,

54:20.080 --> 54:25.040
that creates it, that generates it, then you see the way things are in the scene,

54:25.040 --> 54:28.800
it's just the scene. They never anything, there never was anything more.

54:28.800 --> 54:33.280
They couldn't have been anything more. In the, in the felt, there was just the felt.

54:34.080 --> 54:39.840
In the perceived, there was the perceived. In the intended, there was the intended. Nothing else.

54:39.840 --> 54:53.120
In the world, there was just the world.

54:53.120 --> 55:09.520
So in that sense, you can truly learn from your pain, whatever that pain is.

55:11.440 --> 55:15.920
Not through, like, psychologizing and developing some nice pleasing theories,

55:15.920 --> 55:23.440
hence, you're learning in very common. No, with presence of pain, you automatically, simultaneously,

55:23.440 --> 55:28.000
must have presence of direct luxurious attitude, unless you're fully enlightened.

55:31.920 --> 55:37.120
So through presence of disagreeable, you have a basis for undoing your attitude towards the

55:37.120 --> 55:43.920
disagreeable. Hence, yeah, pain is a great teacher. If done rightly, if you know how to look at it,

55:43.920 --> 56:03.520
if you have a right view because if you know where to look, then all you have to do is

56:03.520 --> 56:14.640
practice composure, self-control, restraint, because all these things will be revealing the nature of

56:14.640 --> 56:19.600
feelings that are experienced unpleasantly, will be revealing the displeasure of sensuality,

56:20.560 --> 56:28.160
the displeasure will will be revealing it, not creating it. And once you reveal the

56:28.160 --> 56:34.160
displeasure that was making you have the attitude towards getting rid of the displeasure, you start

56:34.160 --> 56:45.840
to undo the attitude automatically. That work can be in front of you always. Yeah, yeah sure, sure.

56:45.840 --> 56:49.280
It is always, because it's always something felt, which means there's always attitude in

56:49.280 --> 56:56.400
regard to whatever's being felt. Sorry, that's the only work that needs to be done. That's the

56:56.400 --> 57:01.200
only work that's the work on the most fundamental level. If you fix things on the most fundamental

57:01.200 --> 57:06.800
level, everything else built on double will be fixed equally. If you purify the stream at its

57:06.800 --> 57:13.200
very origin top of the mountain, eventually even the rivers and seas that are being filled by that

57:13.200 --> 57:19.440
stream will be purified. But you can be battling and trying to purify the rivers down the mountain

57:19.440 --> 57:25.920
while there is still the source of pollution remains. And that's how, you know, when the

57:25.920 --> 57:30.080
wheel says he purifies his mind from one wholesome thoughts, from thoughts of sensuality. That's

57:30.080 --> 57:35.120
exactly how it's done, not by chasing every individual, I was thinking this, what does it mean? I would

57:35.120 --> 57:41.200
know. What is the nature of this? Was it rooted in trying to get rid of the pain caused by a

57:41.200 --> 57:46.000
central pleasure, prospect of central pleasure? Was it rooted in trying to get rid of the pain

57:46.000 --> 57:52.160
caused by something disagreeable? Was it trying to get rid of the pain caused by something agreeable?

57:52.160 --> 57:56.080
Was it trying to get rid of the pain caused by neutral? Either way, it's going to be either

57:56.080 --> 58:03.680
centrality, ill will or delusion. So he doesn't entertain you on that level. And that's how he

58:03.680 --> 58:24.640
purifies his behavior in every other regard.
