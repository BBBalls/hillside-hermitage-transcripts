1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
I am actually special interested in that you said that I am, I am actually staying up to

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,600
as a background, but that is what I can't see usually, but when it appears, I am, actually

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:24,400
that's not the one that is very unhealthy, I am, the sense of self, it never appears

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,960
directly, because if it were to appear directly, then you can just say, ah, this is not myself

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,800
and that will be the end of it, but as in like in the sutras, the Buddha said, putujana

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,680
takes, with not self, he takes himself or with self, takes the not self or with self,

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,560
he takes the self, but he can never with not self, take the not self, which means whatever

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:57,240
putujana looks self will be there one way or the other, so that's why when people try

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,720
to apply the practice and say, ah, not, not, not myself, not myself to everything, that

10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,400
doesn't work because it's just like a blanket attitude that you apply to everything,

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,240
but that means your sense of self is actually left out and doing that applying, so that's

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,040
why in the sutras it says, all the terminations are impermanent, all the terminations are

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,760
suffering, all things are not self, it doesn't say all things are impermanent, all things

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,360
are suffering, all things are not self, which is what most people do, they say ah, everything

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,320
is impermanent, everything is not myself, but it doesn't work like, I mean that's true,

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,880
it's not incorrect to say that, but it's not an open eye, it doesn't lead on, you won't

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,040
bring understanding of the Dharma, because the person needs to include himself into

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,960
his insight, and doing that is seeing that yourself, your sense of self depends upon

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,920
something that it's not yours, and when you see that yourself directly stands upon something

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,880
that is not yours, then automatically that sense of self is not yours either, so you don't

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,560
have to then ok, now I will say to myself, this is not myself, no, your experience then

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,040
is the experience of not self, if you see the terminations of that self as impermanent

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,760
and as suffering, so that's why I was saying like, it's not incorrect to say ah, nothing

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,960
is myself, yeah nothing can be yourself, but in terms of the practice it just doesn't

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,080
work, I mean it can work in terms of making people feel better, it's almost like a form

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,240
of denial, just saying everything is not myself, which is why it's more important to first

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,600
recognize that there is a sense of self, I can never see directly, I can never take it

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,920
out, I can never say this is not mine, you'll be finished with it, so you have to recognize

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,160
that it's there, and then affect your whole experience in your practice through seeing

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,800
the terminations, so then the whole experience will be experience of not self, but not just

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,040
selectively picking true, so everything needs to be affected, because although you might

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,640
not be able to pinpoint the sense of self, you know for sure that it's within the experience

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,400
as a whole, so if you're bent on the experience as a whole, you include it, that abandoning

34
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,280
includes the abandoning of the sense of self, so that was the whole, the whole talking

35
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,280
about the general background in particular intentions, because if you're just going

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,240
out particular intentions means you don't really see what's in the background, but then

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,960
if you don't even see what's in the background, you don't even know how to look for the background,

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,680
so whenever you look for the background, you look as if it's particular, you just make

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,760
it, make it actual, make it right in front of you, which means something else is a background

40
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,800
which means the sense of self is hiding somewhere else now, so you have to learn to be mindful

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,560
of the general background without already telling it and making it into particular, because

42
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,040
it's general, and if that's not general something else will be general, so learning to do that

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,640
means, ah, you start to notice more peripherally, without moving your vision left or right

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,600
top or down, you just start to include more in what you already seen, but if each time

45
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,800
you want to see something you keep moving around, you'll end up seeing only that, which

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:26,160
you move to, nothing around it, nothing more, so that was the whole point of that email

47
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,440
in the sense of I am. What did you mean that the intentional situation?

48
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,920
Well, even the general background is already intentional, obviously the intentions are

49
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,520
not as defined as they are particularly, but as I told you that before, a general situation

50
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,640
being in this room gives you a certain set of particular intentions as possibilities

51
00:04:51,640 --> 00:05:00,480
that are allowable in this room, so for example if you go outside, you won't have a chance,

52
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,880
you won't be able to intend to use this water filter to drink water, because that's

53
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,880
in here, so your general situation has changed, so now, okay, drinking water is important,

54
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,400
so you start modifying your general situation so that particular intentions can arise where

55
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:25,480
you can get the water to drink, so it's not the intentions only come from you, like when

56
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,000
you think you're intending, the only reason you're able to intend is because your general

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,640
situation allows you those possibilities that now you're attending and they become

58
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,080
intentions, when you can't create anything in other words, you can't come up, because

59
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,160
if you come up with new things, an intention of a new thing is given from their general

60
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,880
background, so you can only use or choose between the given set of possibilities based

61
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,200
on the general situation, where you are, your abilities, and like body, and bodily predispositions,

62
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,080
height, strength, complexion, all of those are form and they partake and rather they

63
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:18,360
are fundamental form of general situation, because you know a short disabled person cannot

64
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,800
have intentions of running marathon, he might think about it, but for him it's inherently

65
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,080
removed from his fundamental situation that they're determined by his body, and so again

66
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,400
he can use different set, he can focus on different possibilities that arise and then

67
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,840
pursue those directions, but either way all he can do is kind of modify things that are

68
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,600
given beforehand, he can't create anything, and nobody can do anything that he's choosing

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
also based on his ability to give away thoughts, well yeah, like it's not that kind of your

70
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,960
choice is given for you, so there is responsibility for the choice, but the possibilities of your

71
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,920
choice are given beforehand, like when you choose between yes and no, well yes and

72
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,560
no are given beforehand as a form of choice, and then you choose one on the count of the

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,880
other, well it's basically your intentionality that it chooses, by attending the reason for

74
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,200
choosing yes, you choose yes, by attending the reason you choose no, you choose no, by

75
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,240
you know giving into the external pressure or whatever, various factors that affect your

76
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,040
choice, that's high works, so it's not you mean that it's because our hands still has

77
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,040
a choice, but he doesn't have the sense of self anymore, so basically sense of self interferes

78
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:44,200
and takes credit for these things that happen by himself, but it's important to first see

79
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,600
that and then take responsibility for the choice as if it is you who is choosing it, because

80
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,720
that's the only way you can actually through that abandon the sense of self, if you don't

81
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,280
see that and then immediately start saying well I haven't, I'm not doing anything, he's

82
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,240
just this body and everything, that's the denial, for protrusion and that's the denial,

83
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,960
so protrusion first has to admit that he is, that he's choosing, that he's responsible,

84
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,880
that there are results of his actions, that there is mother, there is father, there is killing,

85
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,640
there is giving life, there is all of that, like the mundane right view that Buddha talks

86
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,200
about, once he's able to admit that, to see that, then he can begin abandoning sense of

87
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,440
self through that, without abandoning that view, he abandones his sense of self based on

88
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,560
that, but usually people kind of take a shortcut and then they go straight into saying well everything

89
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,960
is not self, so nobody's doing any action anyway and so on and so forth, which is actually

90
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,800
similar to the wrong views of the Buddha's time that he was often discussing, when people

91
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,520
would say well there is no door, there is no Buddha bad, it's just elements and so on and

92
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,480
so forth, the reason why there is wrong is because there is a sense of self, it's a mistake,

93
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,280
but it's really as a mistake, so denying a mistake means you'll never be able to solve

94
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,920
the mistake, to correct it, to rectify it, because you denied, so first you have to admit

95
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:18,720
that there is a mistake and then you'll be able to fix it, well it's a misunderstanding

96
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,840
that, it's not misunderstanding that there is a modification, it's not misunderstanding

97
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,520
that there is an intention for modification, but a misunderstanding mistake is that it comes

98
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,680
from himself, that his self is the owner of it, he removes the ownership, all of those

99
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,000
things still stay, he's just the ownership is a confusion, thinking that it's me, it's

100
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
mine, I'm doing it.

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:54,120
It's very actually a different point, because I observe a choice, a or b, they are given,

102
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,720
but which one I chose, that was actually it appeared, that thought, exactly, but then

103
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:09,160
you are responsible for accepting that thought, as a decision, as a choice, so yes the thought

104
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:16,160
appeared, you didn't create it either, but you do choose, you do accept, to go with it,

105
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,000
or not go with it, just see what I mean, so even if the thought appears, you can't say

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,240
the choice has been made for me, no, you always make the choice, yeah, so by doing that,

107
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,680
by recognizing that, then you can disown yourself making the choice, not deny yourself making

108
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,720
the choice, there is a big difference there, and the difference is, in that order of things,

109
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,440
first you admit that there is a mistake, and then through the admittance of mistake, you

110
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,560
can rectify the mistake, well the second that denial is different, it's basically, you

111
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,360
see there is a mistake, and then you deny the mistake, say, ah, it's not mine, it doesn't

112
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,240
exist, it's all fixed already, not a problem, we are all in a barn or whatever, and then

113
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,560
you don't see the mistake anyway, you think you fixed it, but actually you just obscured

114
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
it.

115
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,120
So taking up responsibility for your choice, like really feeling responsible, like I am

116
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,120
doing this, I am choosing this, that is the first step, through that you can abandon sense

117
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,600
of I without abandoning responsibility for the action, and that's how you overcome the

118
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,600
action finally, but for as long as you are avoiding responsibility for it, you are avoiding

119
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:36,320
the nature of action, which means you are not overcoming the karma, the first accepting

120
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,840
that this is, I am, I am the choice, yeah, the choice is there, and there is a mistake

121
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,480
of ownership, but it's real as such, so you have to accept it, and then you'll be able

122
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
to fix it.

123
00:11:49,480 --> 00:12:14,600
Well, the mistake is making the karma, which is why the decision remains bound to samsara,

124
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:22,040
so it's a real thing, if he finds out that it's a mistake, it ceases, so he's free,

125
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,440
but yeah, it's not just an illusion, or something like that, because samsara is real, and the

126
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,920
results of the samsara are very real, and the results of one's actions are very, very

127
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,480
real, I could even assert that sometimes people did a little thing that was wrong, but then

128
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,120
it resulted in a lot later on, so it's never guarantee, thinking well, be fine or not,

129
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,440
which means that responsibility is real, so for as long as the person doesn't admit

130
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:56,320
the mistake, the misunderstanding, misappropriation, he won't be able to fix it, so sometimes

131
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,000
people are too keen to fix it, so they quickly fall into denial of it, not self, not self,

132
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,240
not mine, not self, the science has proved nothing is self, nothing is mine, but they're

133
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,040
just obscures, that doesn't accept the responsibility, if you start saying to yourself,

134
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,400
not self, not mine, through the acceptance of that responsibility, and never abandoning

135
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,000
that responsibility, that's a different thing, but usually people do that, they say to

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,840
themselves, not self, in order to avoid the responsibility, because it feels like a fix,

137
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,440
but it's not, well, it's a temporary thing, which means it doesn't really work in a long

138
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
time.

139
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:49,360
How do disolving the accepted it is, it is I am the one, I am responsible for it?

140
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,200
Yeah, disolving, I mean I use that word, but it's not, it's not like, you don't do it,

141
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,040
oh, I don't own this anymore, you disobey it by seeing that you cannot own it in the first

142
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,480
place, by finding out that it's actually impossible to be owned, not knowing that it's impossible

143
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,120
to own something, just because you don't know that it's impossible, that's why you own

144
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
it.

145
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,360
So, finding out that actually, own or not, just makes no difference to the thing, it cannot

146
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,840
access it, cannot master, you cannot be the master of it, nor control it, automatically

147
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,960
you kind of, you stopped owning it, even if you say, oh, this is my book, this is my

148
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,400
chair, this is my phone, internally you don't own anything because you're sold through

149
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:41,720
the nature of it, and there was the case in the suit as well, when people focus on designations

150
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,480
and they think, oh, you shouldn't be saying mine or something, no, it's just a designation

151
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,640
and the Buddha said, that how that uses what I am, but for him, it doesn't mean anything,

152
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,640
certainly, it doesn't mean what it means for Patugian, so it's the same for mine and

153
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,080
belonging to me or whatever else, it's basically the internal connection, it's what matters,

154
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,040
like people can go around saying, not mine, not mine, yet hold tightly on to everything,

155
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,320
because they don't know the way out, another person might not pay any attention to what

156
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,320
he says, but internally he won't own anything.

157
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,920
I feel it's very interesting that the evening, in the case of Arabian, actually, everything

158
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:28,120
is going on from outside, no one can see it, because everything is the same way, but

159
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,200
he knows everything is not the case, only there's a difference, and some people think

160
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,360
they don't feel around, they don't feel, and they don't feel like it flies in the clouds

161
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,120
or whatever else, but no, again, you read the suit as an even the other Arab, and sometimes

162
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,120
you wouldn't be able to recognize another Arab, you would be a bit harder, the Buddha could

163
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,520
do it instantly, or some other monks would grade the powers, but generally, yeah, you

164
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,240
had to talk to the person, you had to see what their view was, that's what the Buddha

165
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,040
was saying, like, don't, don't ever leave anything unturned, like you should question, interrogate

166
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,480
each other, look for the meaning, if the meaning is not clear, press further, until the meaning

167
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,840
is clear, see where your understanding is, see what other monks understand, and that's

168
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:19,040
how both parties learn, if there is a genuine knowledge, that is being pushed further

169
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,240
further, not just the theoretical debate or something like that, but it's not just that

170
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,520
they were talking, but knowing each other's views, knowing where they are, they could tell,

171
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,560
oh, he's an Arab, or he is probably very soon going to be an Arab, or he's far from

172
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,440
an Arab, but if he makes enough effort, he will be one and so on and so forth.

173
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,600
It was very interesting, you said that a lot of many people think that we were born,

174
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,520
right at all here, to see, and to smell, and to taste, and even that is often not a reason,

175
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,840
actually, that's not really a reason, you're not born for anything, nor for nothing.

176
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Just me saying this.

177
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:03,760
Yeah, the idea of purpose comes from already from that mistake.

178
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,360
I think the Buddha said a problem, a few occasions, but I remember one instance when he was

179
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:18,080
saying that because a person takes what it's not his, he makes use out of it, then he basically

180
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,720
owns what you become indebted to tomorrow, and then Mara can do whatever he wants.

181
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,920
So by using things that belong to Mara, you are in Mara's control, and then they ask

182
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,200
him what are those things, and he said it's the sight, sound and smell, taste, touch

183
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,520
as I know, all of the senses and sense bases are Mara's domain, which means they're

184
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,280
not used to begin with, your own eyes, they don't belong to you, they're there, they do

185
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,240
the purpose of looking or whatever else, but none of that obliges you to take them as

186
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:58,680
yours, only not knowing that they are not yours, you automatically take them as yours.

187
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,520
That's why even a newborn baby is already affected by a vision, although it didn't grow

188
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,040
out, it didn't develop designation of the structure, the mind structure and the mentality

189
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,640
intentional, it's already there, just waiting to develop.

190
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:21,280
Actually, all intentions are rising, actually they're like a want to hear, want to see.

191
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,880
Well, everything is intentional in that sense, yeah, it's just removing, or rather seeing

192
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,240
that the center of intention is not in you or mine, it's because things are already intentional.

193
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,080
That's the only reason intention can be there, but you have to see that through accepting

194
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:48,120
responsibility for your choices, for your intentions, not through denying it, or not in order

195
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:55,120
to deny it.

196
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,880
Actually, must think of the being, I think that everything or intention, everything is

197
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
actually arising.

198
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:11,560
Well, not everything, just whatever is present at the moment, like the present intentions

199
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,600
and present general situation, that's what's important, easy stops, thinking, oh, everything

200
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,560
is everything, is that all that means you're falling onto a view, that everything is intentional

201
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,200
and everything is like this, or everything is like that, and everything is not myself.

202
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,200
But that leaves a particular intention in general, in particular sort of order of things,

203
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,920
you don't see, because you're thinking about your view of everything and everything, you

204
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
see what I mean?

205
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,560
The difference is, your particular intentions and your particular situation should be your

206
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:50,600
foundation, not the view that everything is intentional and everything is not self.

207
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,640
So you can't think everything is intentional and everything is not self, if you're already

208
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,000
anchored in your present situation, like general situation, in particular, intentions to

209
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,200
think certain views, well, everything is starting, where you are just saying that everything

210
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
is starting.

211
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,120
The intentions are, I think, from general...

212
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Intentions are...

213
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,600
Okay, that's simply, they're sort of channel directed by the general situation, then within

214
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,600
that you can have more particular intentions, but that's all because general situation is

215
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
still there.

216
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,240
If the general situation changes, the particular set of it, intention will have to change

217
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
as well.

218
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:39,760
I think that before we ask about the support of some people, even when they stay in the

219
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:48,000
temple, sometimes they get, like, not so whole, something important, how it arises

220
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
all day?

221
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,280
Well, when I say general situation, when I give a similar that slope, don't mistake that

222
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,920
for external circumstances.

223
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:06,040
It can be prompted by that, but it corresponds more correctly to moods that people are in.

224
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,760
Happy mood, sad mood, depressed mood, fearful mood, non fearful mood, the elated mood,

225
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,480
well, exactly, that's all the channeling, your intentions, your thoughts, your decisions,

226
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,000
you're in a bad mood, you don't like anybody that day, you're in a good mood, you like

227
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,520
everyone, you can get bad news, you want effect because you're in a good mood, but the

228
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
moods change.

229
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,200
The general situation you've rooted in changes, and when that changes, then your particular

230
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,560
response changes as well, so you have to learn, well, you have to start seeing the impermanence

231
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:46,440
of the moods, of the way that you mean that the general situation is where your mood

232
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
is.

233
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,040
That's what Harvey gave us talking about, he said that the designs, the more general mode

234
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,320
of being is a mood.

235
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,600
That's your first relationship with the world, mood, but when I say first, I mean structurally

236
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,800
first, not linear, not temporally first, doesn't mean 1, 2, 3, but your mood is at the

237
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,680
same time there when your particular intentions and actions are there, but it comes first

238
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,000
in terms of comes before, and that's already a form of relating with the world, interacting

239
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,280
with the world, because you're in a bad mood because of something, or you're in a good

240
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,720
mood, well, maybe because of nothing in particular, but it's still a form of relationship with

241
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,880
the world, which means that that mood, that situation you're in, will be determined

242
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,600
in your particular intentions, so you become mindful of that, you are mindful automatically

243
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,400
of whatever you do particularly, and in return, through developing that mindfulness, you

244
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,480
will be less and less affected by your own moods, and the less you're affected by

245
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,800
your own moods, the less of moods they are, supple some people at least, supple ten

246
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,720
people stay in the same situation, supple in the same trace, extremely, externally it

247
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,720
looks the same, but internally, their mood situation might be very different, they might

248
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,000
have different reasons there doing it, different motivation, it affects them differently, which

249
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,280
means their mood will be different, their minds will be at different stage, at different

250
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
level.

251
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,160
Yeah, being in a different way, not even just being in a different way, supple in the

252
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,960
temples, supple ten monks a year, but at least while they're doing something they

253
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,080
might not be having some, like, a wholesome thought, but the general situation is the same

254
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
in the temple, right?

255
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,120
Well, again, general situation is not the external circumstances of the temple, it's

256
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,560
the general situation of them wanting to be in the temple for various reasons that they

257
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,360
came to the temple.

258
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,840
So general situation, as much as particular situation for the mental is actually rooted

259
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,640
in you, in your actions, in your intentions, not in the world, obviously the monastery

260
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,960
will offer certain intentionality as well, things that are there amongst them, but again,

261
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,080
all of that is experienced internally, so you can't say, oh, they're all in the same

262
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,800
situation, why did they react differently?

263
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,440
They're not.

264
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,640
You're in your own situation, that's all you can know about, then you can see that somewhere

265
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,640
else is in a bad mood, or good mood, or in different mood, and you can say, ah, there

266
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,640
is a bad mood externally, there is a good mood externally, there is a depression externally,

267
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,440
there is a depression internally, if you're depressed or not.

268
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,960
So you can see these things, but again, it's all in relation to the mind, not in relation

269
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,240
to the things, not in relation to the objects of buildings or whatever else, how each person

270
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
reacts differently?

271
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,800
Well, the situation, the roots in situation, they can be experiencing the same things, but

272
00:24:51,800 --> 00:25:00,040
if their mind is rooted in different mood, so to speak, they will be acting differently,

273
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:06,240
or they will be acting for different reasons, or they will be intending different things,

274
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,440
although it externally looks the same, it's done for different reasons, which means

275
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,000
it's a different thing.

276
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,480
So it's not necessarily that somebody is making also offerings, ah, he's a very nice

277
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,560
person, because he might be doing it for bad reasons.

278
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:27,000
Obviously, he still will have some benefit from making offerings anyhow, it's not ideal,

279
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,440
but it's better than not doing it, but if you really want to do it properly, you want

280
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,840
to make them and do it for the right reasons.

281
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:48,920
We would explain that the general situation means the praise, no see, when you say situation

282
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,680
means the place, you lead yourself out, and then you try to introduce yourself into

283
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,240
that situation, and see how can you react differently based on the same situation, but

284
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,240
That's a mistake because actually you can't separate yourself from the situation in the first place.

285
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,240
So when you say situation is the place, no. You have to say situation is me being in a certain place.

286
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Always. You can't leave yourself out.

287
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,240
So me being in the monastery, you being in the monastery, can you be in the monastery?

288
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Anybody being in the monastery, they have a thing that is in common to it, which is being in the monastery.

289
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,240
But the me part is different to all of us, because we came for different reasons.

290
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,240
It can be the same if we are here for the same reasons.

291
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,240
But you can't just focus on the place, because place without you is meaningless. It's not a move.

292
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,240
You mean that the situation means you mean that there is no place.

293
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,240
It means how you feel in a certain place, where your mind is in a certain place.

294
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,240
Generally. Then based on that, you will be making and doing particular actions and choices.

295
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,240
How do I feel?

296
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,240
It means even the five, six people a year, each person is feeling different.

297
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Their situation has things in common. But it's not the same. It doesn't come from the world.

298
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,240
You can't say, are they all in the same place and they are different? No, they are not.

299
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Their places correspond by having in common that they are all in the monastery.

300
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:35,240
But the internal aspect of it, me, my mood, my mind, my feelings, that's unique to all of the aggregates individually.

301
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Which is why there is difference between individuals, even in terms of arrangements.

302
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,240
So you can't separate yourself and think that the place is the situation and then try to explain it to yourself back.

303
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,240
You are already there. Already connected.

304
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Yes, you are part of it. You are inseparable from it.

305
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,240
It just wouldn't make any, it would be inconceivable to think you are part from it.

306
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Unless it's based on a mistake.

307
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,240
It means that the mood, that is a general situation.

308
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:17,240
Yes, because the mood is, you know, I can be in a bad mood, but particularly I can be doing good things.

309
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:25,240
If I don't allow myself to be moved by my bad mood, generally the bad mood is there.

310
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,240
And it's kind of directing me, so I might be doing good things because I want to counter my bad mood.

311
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,240
It's still that's prompted by my bad mood.

312
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,240
So that that general slope is there and then I'm kind of going down it and choosing things.

313
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
So you can always choose wholesome on a kind of unwholesome.

314
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Even if you are in the worst possible mood, there is never justification for unwholesome.

315
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,240
So then when the mood changes, your particular thing might change or might not, if you have enough wisdom.

316
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,240
If you develop enough wisdom to keep choosing wholesome over unwholesome, keep attending wholesome thoughts over unwholesome,

317
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:09,240
despite how you feel, how much pull you experience, how much bad influence you get from the world or whatever.

318
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,240
If you choose to do bad, it's because you chose to do bad.

319
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:20,240
You chose that to be the reason for your bad action or you chose that to be a good reason for your good action.

320
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
You're always responsible.

321
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,240
No matter how bad the mood is, you are always responsible, but it is important to start seeing it first.

322
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Because if you don't see the general background of your mood, of the direction your mind is in,

323
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,240
you will not see a responsibility in regard to that.

324
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,240
You'll just be moved, so you have people who, when they're in the bad mood, they say things to be.

325
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,240
They say that when they offend people, they help people, then they feel bad afterwards.

326
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,240
When they kind of come out of the bad mood, they apologize, I'll never do that again.

327
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Then they do it again.

328
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Then your people, when they're in a good mood, they're so excited, ecstatic, they get a bit too much.

329
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Then afterwards they feel a bit shameful off.

330
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
I've got to be carried away.

331
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,240
Because they're not aware of the general situation, of the general direction of their mood,

332
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:14,240
which means they're not being aware, they don't have a safeguard, so they're always taken by it.

333
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,240
And that's what the mindfulness is.

334
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Before you explain that the mountain and that the shruff and that already included means that the mood,

335
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
that itself has a mood.

336
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,240
It's not something like...

337
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
No, no, no, the actual location.

338
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,240
So that is the reason that some people, even when they stay in the temple,

339
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
that their mood is not not good.

340
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
That's the reason.

341
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,240
They can be sitting by next to the Buddha and still.

342
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Yeah, there were cases like in December of the Buddha, but they were just not.

343
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
The mind wouldn't be there.

344
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,240
And they say, well, you're wasting your opportunity.

345
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,240
But yeah, it doesn't necessarily mean that, like going to a place that the temple can't remind you,

346
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,240
oh, well, it can remind you if you were to know what you're supposed to do.

347
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,240
So if you were to know that you're supposed to be mindful of your moods

348
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,240
and take responsibility for your choices,

349
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,240
then going to a monastery or even the sutras can't remind you of that when you forget.

350
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,240
But if you don't know that in the first place, well, no amount of visits to the monastery

351
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,240
will make a difference because you can't be reminded of something that you don't know.

352
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,240
So you'll probably get different things than in the monastery.

353
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,240
And people will go for different reasons to a monastery, superstition or whatever.

354
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Usually is a superstition, regardless of the religion as well.

355
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,240
But it's Buddhism or Christianity, so usually that's the reason why people go to churches and so on.

356
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,240
It's quite hard after to maintain mindfulness that with the thinking I would consider the background.

357
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Well, because you're trying to maintain mindfulness in a particular sense,

358
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
you're trying to keep it in front of you.

359
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
But that's not mindfulness.

360
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Mindfulness is knowing the background without interfering with it.

361
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,240
So if I ask you now, are you in a good or a bad mood, you will know the answer.

362
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,240
You might not be able to define it specifically, but you will know it's all right,

363
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
or no one more too good.

364
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
And that knowledge is already there.

365
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,240
It is not only to see the phrase, but not that, that it's a mood that I have to see.

366
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Well, the fact that you can give me the answer to what your mood is at any time

367
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
means that knowledge is there at any time.

368
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Or the superstition is important.

369
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Yeah, so that's something you can be mindful of.

370
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Only that is necessary to be mindful of, nothing else.

371
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Before I remember, you said that I'm sitting in the cave,

372
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
could he and something, something?

373
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
You were explaining about the situation.

374
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Is it increasing the mood or is it increasing?

375
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
I am sitting.

376
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
I am doing.

377
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
I am.

378
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Means, yeah.

379
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Means, basically, you are in such a such situation, which means your mood is there.

380
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,240
So is it important to see that I am sitting in the cave?

381
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Is it important?

382
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,240
No, that was just the example I gave you as a more general situation.

383
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Like, I am in the monastery now.

384
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
You can be mindful of that.

385
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Or you can be mindful of, I am.

386
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
I am feeling elated now.

387
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Or I am feeling depressed now.

388
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Again, I can such a fatara so that when the Buddha refers to the mind,

389
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,240
he says, he knows mind, like literally for what it is.

390
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
He knows elated mind as elated mind.

391
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,240
He knows depressed mind as depressed mind.

392
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Happy mind as happy, expanded mind, shrunk mind.

393
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Like different shapes the mind can take.

394
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
He knows them.

395
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
But that's it.

396
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,240
So you're not trying to change it or whatever.

397
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,240
You just are. The mind is in that state, which means it will be affecting my particular choices.

398
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,240
So if the mind is in the pressed mood, you're mindful of it.

399
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,240
You will be more aware of the choices you make, which means you will not be making bad choices,

400
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,240
because you know that the mind will be trying to get you to make the bad choices,

401
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
because the mind is depressed.

402
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,240
In the same sense, when the mind is happy, you won't be overreaching in terms of your great choices,

403
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,240
because you know, the mind is elated, which means the perspective is a bit lost.

404
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,240
So you won't have the mind even, but like even another hand will practice mindfulness

405
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,240
in terms of the different shapes his mind will take.

406
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,240
It's just that he completely, completely saved any bond with that mind or with the body.

407
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,240
So whichever shape his mind takes, it doesn't affect him.

408
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
And so he's gone beyond.

409
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,240
But until that's the case, you need to keep that mind.

410
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,240
Because if you're only aware of mindful what's in front of you,

411
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,240
means you're not seeing your mind, because your mind is never in front of you.

412
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
It's always in the back.

413
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Why do we see situations in front of you?

414
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Well, if you're seeing situation in front of you, that's not your situation anymore.

415
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,240
Situation is where the mind is, which is always in the background.

416
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,240
Mood is where the mind is, which is always in the background.

417
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,240
But if you try to see it in front of you, it means whatever you're seeing in front of you is not the background.

418
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,240
Even if it was the background before, the faith that you put it in front means something else is now.

419
00:34:53,240 --> 00:35:00,240
It means only has to keep seeing the mood, the mental state.

420
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,240
Well, you have to keep seeing the relationship between the two.

421
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,240
You have to keep seeing the mood, the mental state, and the relationship between your particular situation,

422
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,240
like particular choices you make.

423
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Means this intention?

424
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Means things I'm about to do based on how I feel.

425
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,240
To put it simply, yeah.

426
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
I feel bad, I feel neutral.

427
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
What am I doing right now?

428
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,240
Because whatever you do actually is rooted in how you feel.

429
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Body-feeling?

430
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,240
No, there's no feelings, those are all perceptions.

431
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Like, each is a perception.

432
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,240
You might dislike your reach.

433
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,240
So experience this pleasure in your mind on account of the body-lead.

434
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,240
But it's not that you're experiencing this pleasure in your body as a sensation.

435
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,240
No, that's just the perception of touch.

436
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Pain is feeling, is it?

437
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Pain is feeling, yes.

438
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Pain is perception.

439
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Yeah.

440
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:09,240
So each can be painful, or sometimes each can be pleasant, depending on whatever people are interested.

441
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Pain, nothing you say, that I'm present.

442
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Yeah, pain is I'm present.

443
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,240
Every feeling is mental.

444
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,240
And people misunderstand, they think, because when they say that, they're bodily feelings,

445
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,240
but he said their feelings caused in regard to the body.

446
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
So people misunderstand that and use that to explain sensation.

447
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
That's my bodily feeling.

448
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
No, it's not.

449
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Every feeling is chetastic, it's a parallel.

450
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,240
It's mental.

451
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,240
So if it's in regard to the body, then it's called bodily feeling.

452
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
But it's still a mental feeling.

453
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,240
If it's in regard to the mind, then it's kind of doubly mental feeling.

454
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,240
But either if you're feeling being in regard to body, it's mental in itself.

455
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,240
So as I said, when you have a bodily itch, bodily discomfort,

456
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,240
you will most likely experience mentally, unpleasant feeling.

457
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,240
But it's not that unpleasant feeling is in your leg.

458
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:12,240
It's a very sharp sensation of severed leg, and a kind of almost unbearable pain mentally.

459
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:20,240
But if you're mentally free from that pain, that discomfort ceases to cause you suffering.

460
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:27,240
So that's why I like the arrangements were the minds developed in terms of genres,

461
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,240
and they could bear a lot of physical discomfort.

462
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
It wouldn't be discomfort for them.

463
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,240
It's just the way the mind relates to it.

464
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,240
When the Buddha asked Mahakasava said, you're very old now, you've done what is to be done.

465
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Why don't you come with me?

466
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
I get lots of offerings.

467
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
I get silk robes, staying in these palaces.

468
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,240
So you can come and stay with me because there's no need for you to be living rough in the forest.

469
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,240
And he said, oh, there's no need, Lord, because whoever can obtain genres it will.

470
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Like these reg ropes and these forests will feel like the softest, highest, most pleasant dwellings and abiding.

471
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Because that's how it feels to the mind that it's trained in genres.

472
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,240
And then another case when the Buddha was instructing a very long rule of it,

473
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,240
when he said, develop genres so that the hemp robes you're wearing will feel like silk.

474
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Develop genres so that the sleeping under the root of tree will feel like sleeping in a plastered palace.

475
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:35,240
And then develop genres so that the rough hemp robes, like unclean rice you eat,

476
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,240
would feel like the softest rice with the nicest caries.

477
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,240
And then it was for medicine and so on.

478
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Saying basically that the mind state, the mind development will determine your relationship with your body.

479
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,240
So the body is going through discomfort.

480
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Well, whether usually discomfort is associated with pain, mental pain.

481
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,240
So if there is no discomfort, there is no pain.

482
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Associated with mental pain?

483
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,240
Yeah, experiencing suffering in regard to discomfort.

484
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Everybody dislikes discomfort.

485
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,240
But if you develop your mind means less and less things will be discomfortable to you.

486
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
I'm comfortable.

487
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,240
I'm comfortable.

488
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
How do they have unpleasant feelings?

489
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,240
They do. Yeah, taking stuff.

490
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,240
So arahant can be an arahant without being mastered all of the genres.

491
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,240
So that's why you had arahants who were in great pain physically experiencing sharp piercings,

492
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,240
sensations, piercings, perceptions on a counter grid.

493
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240
But they were not suffering internally.

494
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
There was no duke.

495
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,240
But it's just that their relationship with the body was kind of unbearable and pointless.

496
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Because they were arahants.

497
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,240
They had no reason to endure all of those sharp discomfort.

498
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,240
But discomfort in itself is not actually painful.

499
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,240
It's the mental resistance in regard to it that makes you suffer on account of discomfort.

500
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,240
It makes you fear discomfort.

501
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,240
It makes you really work hard to not experience discomfort.

502
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,240
I mean, how do they feel unpleasant feelings but no suffering?

503
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Well, I would be speaking.

504
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Like you can't say that because if you say for protrusion that he feels unpleasant feelings,

505
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,240
you can't use the same designation for an arahant.

506
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,240
Because from protrusion point of view, arahant doesn't have any feelings anymore.

507
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
He has overcome them.

508
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,240
And the fact that he doesn't feel anything anymore, that's what's pleasant for him.

509
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,240
And that's what the Sariputu said.

510
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:43,240
So you have to distinguish the bodily discomfort from pain, from displeasure, from duke.

511
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Because being able to bear this discomfort, that's why sometimes it's necessary.

512
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,240
That's why for some people a satis is a woodwork.

513
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,240
It will make them see things rightly, not for everyone, but for some people it would.

514
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,240
Which is why the Buddha said, well, if you agreed aversion and delusion decreases

515
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,240
while doing a satis practices, then do it.

516
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
If it's not decreasing, then don't do it.

517
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,240
But yes, some people do need to go through discomfort in order to start to see the difference.

518
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,240
The discomfort is not automatically a pain.

519
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,240
It's your mental resistance that makes yourself and makes you confuse it.

520
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,240
So by overcoming that, you overcome discomfort and then you don't fear it.

521
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,240
And as the Buddha did, he was the Buddha.

522
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,240
So he didn't have to pursue discomfort anymore, what for?

523
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
Either way, he was not affected by it.

524
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
So he would just go wherever he was.

525
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Sometimes he would sleep on a stack of hay, under the tree.

526
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,240
Sometimes he would sleep in a king's palace, if that's where he was at the time,

527
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
going behind it or whatever else.

528
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:52,240
So it's not the external things will determine necessarily what it's good or bad.

529
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,240
It's basically your attitude in regard to it.

530
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,240
But sometimes people can go and live roughly in the forest and under the root of tree

531
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,240
for completely wrong reasons.

532
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,240
They don't see this difference, they address torture in themselves and thinking

533
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,240
the true torture, they will be developing purification and strength.

534
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,240
But they want, they have developed endurance, but misguided endurance.

535
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,240
So the endurance has to be ruined to the right view.

536
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Well, anything has to be ruined to the right view, you know, to be right.

537
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Which is why a person shouldn't go to a forest and start experiencing themselves

538
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,240
unless it's a sort of a, unless he has genres, unless other establishments have been made,

539
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
as the Buddha said.

540
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,240
So you just end up doing it for unwholesome reasons.

541
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,240
And your answer is actually very difficult point under some,

542
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,240
because sometimes I feel that because of a self view that's try to go against,

543
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,240
like try to change the teams.

544
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,240
That is actually based on the self view that they're going to see.

545
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Well, like again, even if it is based on the self view, it's really less such.

546
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,240
So if you have a thought of wanting to change things, that's something you include in your mindfulness.

547
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,240
Even if it came from yourself, from the mistake of yourself or not,

548
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,240
it's real as such. It's there. You just experienced it.

549
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,240
It's your mindful of that.

550
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
So you don't divide out this came from this. That's okay.

551
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
It's came from another one. No.

552
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Whatever your experience, it's real as that experience.

553
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,240
Even if it's an abstract experience of something that you've never seen,

554
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,240
they start to, you're experienced it in your mind as such,

555
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,240
and it's real in that way.

556
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,240
So if you're having resistance in regard to endurance,

557
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,240
that's part of the endurance.

558
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,240
If you have thoughts of resisting this,

559
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,240
that's all result of you enduring.

560
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,240
So you're just included in endurance.

561
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Are not they endurance?

562
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Are not can endure.

563
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,240
But Argo wants to suffer on account of his endurance.

564
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,240
He won't fear the endurance.

565
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,240
He won't try to avoid it.

566
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,240
If he comes, he comes. If he doesn't, he doesn't.

567
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,240
He won't try to avoid it, but he won't go after it either.

568
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,240
Because he has no need for it.

569
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,240
For puttu, you know, this is enduring sometimes,

570
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
that the suffering that you've been involved in.

571
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,240
Again, it needs to be done for the whole some reasons.

572
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,240
Like puttu, you know, I can endure a lot.

573
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,240
You know, there are people setting yourself on fire,

574
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
complete misguided puttu,

575
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
it's for ridiculous political reasons.

576
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,240
Like how dumb is that?

577
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,240
Complete misguided.

578
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,240
Yet it's extreme for endurance and people do it.

579
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,240
And that means nothing.

580
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,240
But if somebody would endure very little for the right reasons,

581
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,240
he would reap much more benefit.

582
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,240
So if you endure, because the endurance has a reason,

583
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,240
because you don't go after it,

584
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
nor do you run away from it,

585
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
nor do you do anything on account of it,

586
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,240
that's already more awesome.

587
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Then you can know endurance for what it is,

588
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,240
or lack of it for what it is,

589
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,240
or need of development for what it is.

590
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,240
You won't be running away from it,

591
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,240
because sometimes people get really into enduring

592
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
as a form of running away from it.

593
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
I fear this, so I'm going to go and face it,

594
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
because I'm terrified of it.

595
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
And then they end up torturing themselves

596
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,240
as if that will kind of make them overcome the fear.

597
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
If there is any wisdom in regard to it,

598
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,240
it might help them,

599
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
like putting themselves through rough situations,

600
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
it might help them,

601
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
if there is a wisdom basis.

602
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,240
But if there isn't,

603
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,240
it will just make them overcome around the same issue.

604
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
Something actually even fail.

605
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,240
Even fail, we don't do anything.

606
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Automatically,

607
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
all these stuff moving,

608
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,240
and sometimes it's quite interesting,

609
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
sometimes it's just sitting,

610
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
and not thinking to the anything.

611
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Automatically, all these stuff moving,

612
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,240
they're doing, they're thinking.

613
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,240
Yeah, exactly.

614
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,240
I would have said,

615
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
you know, it's all happening,

616
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:55,240
but it's something ready to begin to be one.

617
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,240
Well, it's basically, as I said,

618
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,240
the body doesn't need self-tooperate.

619
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Intentions don't need self-tooperate.

620
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,240
So they've been operating on their own

621
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,240
before, for protruding now,

622
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,240
or after, for an around.

623
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,240
The problem is,

624
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,240
protruding first needs to accept the responsibility for yourself,

625
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
which is done through developing mindfulness

626
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,240
in regard to body and whatever else.

627
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,240
Actions, choices, specifically.

628
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,240
And then, through accepting the responsibility,

629
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,240
you can eventually reach the point

630
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
when you just see, oh yeah,

631
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,240
the intentionality doesn't require sense of self.

632
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,240
It's all operating.

633
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
But if you start doing it before,

634
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,240
you fully accept responsibility,

635
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
then it will more,

636
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,240
be like, more forgetfulness.

637
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
You forgot to be mindful,

638
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,240
and yeah, the body is just doing things.

639
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
But that's all rooted in our awesome,

640
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,240
because of the self-view.

641
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,240
So, other hands,

642
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,240
forgetfulness, so to speak,

643
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
is different from the forget,

644
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
like, other hands, forgetfulness,

645
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,240
will not induce self-view,

646
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,240
will not induce a region,

647
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
which means, basically,

648
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,240
it's not really forgetfulness.

649
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,240
But for protruding,

650
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,240
and with yeast, forgetfulness,

651
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,240
you forget all the way.

652
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
Yeah, I know.

653
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,240
And that's how the region,

654
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,240
ignorance,

655
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,240
is maintained.

656
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,240
I am fully, fully,

657
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
I got just simply,

658
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
it was not...

659
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
Well, so to speak,

660
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,240
but the thing is,

661
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,240
like, if you are forgetfulness,

662
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,240
it's not inducing a region.

663
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
I mean, you are mindful

664
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,240
of you being forgetful.

665
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
So, you might be forgetful

666
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
in terms of particular things,

667
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
or I forgot the number,

668
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,240
or something,

669
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,240
but I didn't forget the nature of forgetting.

670
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,240
I'm mindful of that.

671
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,240
That's why the garhant mindfulness

672
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,240
is so fully developed.

673
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
And he can't stop doing it.

674
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,240
So, to speak, he's always mindful

675
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,240
in that sense.

676
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,240
But he's not always mindful

677
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
in a sense of contemporary repersonal

678
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,240
like touching, moving,

679
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,240
moving like a rover.

680
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,240
No, means he can't forget,

681
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
he's forgetfulness.

682
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
Forgetfulness will not induce

683
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,240
a region anymore for him.

684
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,240
So, you might hear

685
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,240
forget particular things,

686
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,240
as an experience of forgetting,

687
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
of forgetting,

688
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
he's mindful of that.

689
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
And that same cannot be said

690
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,240
for protruding.

691
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,240
Okay, sometimes even if I'm not mindful,

692
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240
everything is going well.

693
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Yeah.

694
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,240
Whether you're mindful

695
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
or not, things are intentional

696
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,240
and they are going.

697
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
The thing is,

698
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,240
you do have to accept responsibility for it.

699
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Like, that's why the,

700
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
that's why the situation of protrusion

701
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
is kind of perilous.

702
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,240
In a way,

703
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,240
you're not in control of everything,

704
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
or of anything,

705
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,240
but in the same way,

706
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,240
you're responsible for everything.

707
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,240
So, you can't control anything,

708
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,240
but you have full responsibility

709
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
for all of it.

710
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,240
And it's true.

711
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Because protrusion,

712
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,240
you might say,

713
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,240
oh well, I'm not doing this

714
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
and it's just my body.

715
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,240
The fact is,

716
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,240
when he dies, he'll be reborn again

717
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
because he's protrusioned

718
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,240
and because of the actions,

719
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,240
even if my body just made these actions,

720
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,240
you will be experiencing those results

721
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,240
because you took that body to be yours.

722
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,240
So, in that sense,

723
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,240
he needs to fully accept

724
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,240
his responsibility

725
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,240
even for accidents,

726
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
even for things that are not

727
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,240
in his control clear.

728
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,240
And you're fully accepting

729
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,240
the responsibility

730
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,240
he can eventually overcome,

731
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,240
but not before.

732
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,240
Again,

733
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,240
that's why the mundane

734
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,240
right view comes first,

735
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,240
like admitting.

736
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,240
Are you only,

737
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,240
he needs free from karma,

738
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
or is free from karma?

739
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,240
Yeah, well,

740
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,240
Arya has a limited life.

741
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,240
Really, very good.

742
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,240
So, the sort of money

743
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,240
is free from karma?

744
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Well, relatively.

745
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
Ultimately,

746
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,240
yes, within seven,

747
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
at most,

748
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,240
but he'll be done,

749
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,240
but he still has

750
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,240
kind of the wheel

751
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,240
didn't quite stop spinning yet.

752
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,240
But he will.

753
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,240
He does serve you

754
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
this karma.

755
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,240
Sorry?

756
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,240
Without serve view,

757
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
that they have no

758
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
no serve view,

759
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,240
even sort of money,

760
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,240
they don't believe in servo.

761
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,240
Yeah, but they still have

762
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,240
residues of conceit.

763
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,240
Conceit, I am.

764
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
Yeah, they don't have

765
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
a self-view in terms of thinking

766
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,240
themselves as living

767
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,240
like an independent

768
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
master of five aggregates.

769
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
They don't have that anymore.

770
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
But they still have

771
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
conceit in sense of I am,

772
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
and they still have degree

773
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
of greedy version of delusion,

774
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
because of which

775
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
they will be evolving

776
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
a bit longer,

777
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,240
until they make enough effort,

778
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
whether in this life or,

779
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,240
but someone

780
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,240
doesn't necessarily

781
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
have to be born

782
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
seven times.

783
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,240
He can become

784
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,240
out of his second

785
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,240
lifetime,

786
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,240
or third,

787
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
or fourth or fifth,

788
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
at most,

789
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
seven.

790
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
Yeah.

791
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
For me,

792
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
very difficult

793
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,240
on this end of the first

794
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,240
section,

795
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,240
it's very difficult

796
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,240
to have a whole path.

797
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,240
Perception means

798
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
a lot like a helping

799
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
knowledge to arise.

800
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
No, I think something like a

801
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,240
perception means

802
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
perceiving.

803
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
It means things that are

804
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,240
right.

805
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,240
In the case of pain,

806
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,240
the user pain is feeling.

807
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,240
Yeah.

808
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,240
Perception means

809
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,240
the user there like

810
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,240
I am.

811
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,240
Well, what is causing the pain?

812
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,240
There is, you can't

813
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Well, not necessarily the

814
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,240
cause of pain,

815
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,240
but basically perception

816
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,240
and feeling are inseparable.

817
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,240
You can't just

818
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,240
perceive or just feel.

819
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,240
Whenever you feel,

820
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,240
you're perceiving

821
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,240
something.

822
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,240
Whenever you're perceiving

823
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,240
something,

824
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,240
you're feeling something.

825
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,240
So, if you say,

826
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,240
I have feeling of pain,

827
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
well, there is a perception

828
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
in regard to it.

829
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
Usually,

830
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
it's what causes your pain.

831
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
Hmm.

832
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,240
Suppose if I

833
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,240
that's a fire.

834
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,240
Well, that's a sharp,

835
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,240
piercing perception.

836
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
That's it.

837
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,240
That you don't want to endure.

838
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,240
But that's not necessarily pain.

839
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,240
Hmm.

840
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,240
If somebody tells you,

841
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,240
if you touch this fire,

842
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,240
how will, I don't know,

843
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,240
save 500 dying children

844
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
and you're going to touch the fire

845
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
and you'll be very happy

846
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
that you've done it.

847
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
Cause you know,

848
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,240
you save 500 lives.

849
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Hmm.

850
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,240
So, you won't be suffering

851
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,240
on a kind of touching the fire.

852
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,240
Hmm.

853
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,240
But if you want,

854
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,240
I don't know,

855
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
if you're a painter

856
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
and you're part of your painting

857
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
and then you burn your hand

858
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
and you can't paint,

859
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
you can't earn any more,

860
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,240
your family suffering,

861
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,240
you'll be suffering a lot

862
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,240
on a kind of touching the fire.

863
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Fire.

864
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
It's the same perception,

865
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
touching the fire.

866
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
Oh, because it's telling you

867
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
that the touching the fire.

868
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
Yeah.

869
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,240
Yeah.

870
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,240
It's a bodily perception.

871
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,240
You perception of touch.

872
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,240
Hmm.

873
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,240
You see,

874
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
seeing something disagreeable.

875
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,240
Yeah.

876
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,240
Like you can see something disagreeable

877
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,240
or agreeable.

878
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,240
But you don't have to neither suffer

879
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,240
nor be happy on a kind of it.

880
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,240
But usually people are.

881
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,240
Oh.

882
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,240
I see something agreeable.

883
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,240
I like it.

884
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,240
I want more of it.

885
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,240
You get very related.

886
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,240
You see something disagreeable

887
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,240
who I don't want to look at it.

888
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,240
I don't like it.

889
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,240
Hmm.

890
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,240
And if you have no choice

891
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,240
but to look at it,

892
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,240
you'll start suffering.

893
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
I think that if I,

894
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,240
if I call it pain,

895
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,240
it becomes different.

896
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,240
Because I write a body of pain.

897
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
But actually,

898
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,240
it's just unpleasant.

899
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
That's why,

900
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,240
you know,

901
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
if you don't like it,

902
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,240
you'll start suffering.

903
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,240
I think that if I,

904
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,240
that's why I was telling you,

905
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,240
when you told me that,

906
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,240
how getting rid of the bodily pains

907
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,240
or whatever I said,

908
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,240
well, that's irrelevant,

909
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,240
in a way.

910
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,240
Hmm.

911
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,240
There is nothing to do

912
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,240
to the nature of suffering,

913
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,240
to do it.

914
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
I go,

915
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,240
I have a pain in my right arm.

916
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,240
Well, first of all,

917
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,240
it's not in your right arm.

918
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
It's discomfort in your right arm.

919
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,240
On a counter,

920
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,240
which your mind is bothered.

921
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,240
But if you think the pain is in your right arm,

922
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,240
then fixing your right arm,

923
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,240
will feel like you fixed your pain.

924
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,240
Which means you're actually trying

925
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,240
to fix your dukkha

926
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,240
at a completely wrong domain.

927
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,240
You're trying to,

928
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,240
and lots of meditation

929
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,240
that people teach

930
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,240
is about that,

931
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,240
or observing the sensations

932
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,240
and feeling your body like this,

933
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,240
and if it feels tight,

934
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,240
you lose it.

935
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,240
It's actually relevant

936
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,240
in every possible way.

937
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,240
How do you see that,

938
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,240
what's the reason?

939
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,240
Where am I?

940
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
Where am I supposed to make it?

941
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,240
It could not be more.

942
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,240
I, I, I think,

943
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,240
before.

944
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,240
Yeah, it could not be more.

945
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,240
It's guided.

946
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,240
It's completely misprojected.

947
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,240
It's exactly what I'm saying just now.

948
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,240
Like, you, you, you, you're looking

949
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,240
at a completely wrong place

950
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,240
for a solution to the problem of suffering.

951
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,240
Many people believe

952
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,240
going to Arhant or whatever.

953
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,240
Well, yeah.

954
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,240
People believe in various things.

955
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
The reason why,

956
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,240
why people feel it works,

957
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,240
is because

958
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,240
most of people they do it,

959
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,240
are lay people with very busy lives,

960
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,240
and then,

961
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
you never really stop,

962
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,240
you never really reflect,

963
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,240
you don't really have any right views,

964
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,240
so then you go to a place

965
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,240
of an intensive retreat,

966
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,240
controlled retreat,

967
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,240
but every moment,

968
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,240
it's kind of tacky,

969
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,240
tacky, tacky,

970
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
you do this,

971
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,240
you do this,

972
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,240
you do this, you watch,

973
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,240
you watch,

974
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,240
and it almost feels like a release.

975
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,240
But the release comes from the novelty,

976
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,240
from this new kind of compressed thing,

977
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,240
that then brings out the release.

978
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,240
But it's nothing to do with wisdom.

979
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,240
A key few develop wisdom in regard to it.

980
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,240
It will not be on account of going as techniques.

981
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,240
It will be on account of you

982
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,240
practicing understanding,

983
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
trying to understand,

984
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
trying to find out

985
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,240
what understanding means.

986
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,240
And when you do,

987
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
you realize you don't have to do going.

988
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,240
Well, not more than go out,

989
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,240
by yourself,

990
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,240
and start sweeping trees,

991
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
or carry bricks,

992
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
if you want.

993
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,240
P.T. is like a feeding,

994
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,240
feelings in power,

995
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
to keep all the loving,

996
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,240
and to go in,

997
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,240
and let this look in.

998
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
Yeah, it's all based on the body.

999
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,240
Based on the body.

1000
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,240
Yeah, you observe bodily sensations,

1001
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,240
which is ordered,

1002
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
your contradiction in terms.

1003
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
You don't feel your body.

1004
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,240
You perceive it.

1005
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,240
You can experience feelings in your mind,

1006
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,240
in regard to what body is going through,

1007
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,240
especially if you're

1008
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,240
identifying with your body,

1009
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,240
your material form,

1010
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,240
you're suffering more than.

1011
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,240
But again,

1012
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
any suffering that happens,

1013
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,240
or not,

1014
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,240
happens on the level of mind,

1015
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,240
not on the body.

1016
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,240
So then removing a particular knee pain,

1017
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,240
it's playing ridiculous,

1018
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,240
when it comes to understanding the nature of suffering.

1019
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,240
Like, why would this be relevant in any way?

1020
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,240
Yeah, just stretch your knee, if it hurts.

1021
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
That's the end of it.

1022
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
Well, I'm concentrating on the method

1023
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,240
that only one thing is,

1024
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,240
this body is changing.

1025
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,240
This encounter is really ticker.

1026
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,240
Well, yeah,

1027
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,240
they say the body is changing

1028
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,240
in that sense,

1029
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,240
it's constantly changing,

1030
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,240
like a constant flow.

1031
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,240
But that's not true,

1032
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,240
because it's changing on one level,

1033
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,240
but on another level,

1034
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,240
it's still the same body.

1035
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Because if the body is constantly changing,

1036
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,240
every second becoming different body,

1037
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,240
you wouldn't be able to refer to it as the body.

1038
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,240
You wouldn't be able to use the same designation for it.

1039
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,240
But the fact that you can say it's still the same body,

1040
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,240
means that change that the Buddha talks about

1041
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,240
is slightly more complex than just saying it's all impermanent.

1042
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,240
And modern science has proven

1043
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,240
that atoms and electrons are constantly changing,

1044
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,240
so everything is in a constant change.

1045
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,240
If everything is constantly changing,

1046
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
there is no change at all.

1047
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,240
Because in order for change to be perceived,

1048
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,240
there has to be a part that's not changing.

1049
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,240
Otherwise, you can't say it's changing.

1050
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,240
There is no reference point.

1051
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,240
So saying the body is constantly changing

1052
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,240
is a contradiction in terms,

1053
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,240
or a wrong view.

1054
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,240
Because it's changing on one level

1055
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,240
while still remaining the same.

1056
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,240
So, all myoko is the same myoko.

1057
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,240
There was young myoko.

1058
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,240
Obviously, there is a difference.

1059
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,240
The body, you know,

1060
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,240
grew bigger, got older and so on.

1061
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,240
But it's still the same body.

1062
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,240
So change, or rather, is in a way called invariant,

1063
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,240
under transformation,

1064
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,240
or means persisting while changing,

1065
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,240
persisting the same,

1066
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,240
while it's changing on another level.

1067
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1068
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,240
He was looking at the hand,

1069
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,240
holding the pen,

1070
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,240
and something,

1071
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,240
is it the same or different?

1072
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,240
Is it the same or the thing

1073
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,240
he was speaking about,

1074
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,240
is it changing in form or something?

1075
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,240
Well, I don't really remember that context,

1076
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,240
but I think...

1077
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,240
Is it, like,

1078
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,240
he was looking at the pen,

1079
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,240
that he was holding the pen in his hand,

1080
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,240
and is it that, like,

1081
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,240
the same or different?

1082
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,240
I remember,

1083
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,240
when a barber,

1084
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,240
he explained the like,

1085
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,240
that the ship,

1086
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,240
that there's some part over the ship,

1087
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,240
that the gradually replacing,

1088
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,240
and is it the same ship for another?

1089
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,240
Is it...

1090
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,240
I see what you mean.

1091
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,240
No, that was slightly different though.

1092
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,240
I think there was a different context.

1093
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Now, I was talking about the pen,

1094
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,240
it was about the intention

1095
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,240
to run the letter,

1096
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,240
intention to go with the meaning and so on,

1097
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,240
but in a way,

1098
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,240
that's what I was telling you,

1099
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,240
maybe last week,

1100
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,240
I don't know what it was,

1101
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,240
when I said,

1102
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,240
when you designate a thing,

1103
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,240
that designation is part of a thing.

1104
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,240
So, when you refer to something as a ship,

1105
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,240
you designate certain collection

1106
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,240
of things as a ship.

1107
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,240
So,

1108
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,240
sometimes you can change parts so much,

1109
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,240
that it becomes a different ship.

1110
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,240
But if your designation was on the level of A ship,

1111
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,240
means it still stayed the same,

1112
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,240
because although it's all different parts,

1113
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,240
it's still a ship.

1114
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,240
Obviously, if you start putting car parts on your ship,

1115
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,240
and then you turn it into a car,

1116
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,240
you can't say it's a ship anymore.

1117
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
It means off,

1118
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
it's a car now,

1119
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,240
so it has changed.

1120
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,240
But that change is external.

1121
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,240
That change has nothing to do with the impermanence of the terminations,

1122
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,240
that the Buddha is talking about.

1123
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,240
Sabres and Karna Nietzsche is nothing to do with them,

1124
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,240
because this is just something you observe with your senses.

1125
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,240
Oh, yeah, the curtains have faded,

1126
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,240
the door is broken.

1127
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,240
It's irrelevant.

1128
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,240
What is not irrelevant is you move in regard to it,

1129
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,240
your feelings in regard to that.

1130
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,240
So, if that door was a very important door,

1131
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,240
given to you by very important person handcrafted,

1132
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,240
it would be a very valuable door,

1133
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,240
and if it gets broken,

1134
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,240
you suffer because the whole significance is affected by it.

1135
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,240
It means you were attached to it in a way,

1136
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,240
but saying that the door is constantly changing

1137
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,240
makes no difference to the fact that it is significant

1138
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,240
and it means a lot to me.

1139
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,240
So, whether it's changing or not,

1140
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,240
the significance of the door or of any object that you are attached to,

1141
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,240
it remains unaffected.

1142
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,240
So, you can be trying to repeat,

1143
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,240
it's all changing, it's all changing.

1144
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,240
Still, it means a lot to you.

1145
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,240
And by saying it's all changing, it's all changing,

1146
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,240
you're basically trying to deny the fact

1147
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,240
that it means a lot to you.

1148
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,240
Instead of taking responsibility,

1149
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,240
that it means a lot to you.

1150
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,240
And through accepting responsibility for different amounts of meanings,

1151
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,240
so to speak, different significance,

1152
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,240
like, I don't care much about this sheet,

1153
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,240
but I care about the water filter,

1154
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,240
because it's more important to me.

1155
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,240
And that's normal.

1156
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,240
It's different levels of intentionality.

1157
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,240
But me, trying to deny all of that,

1158
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,240
thinking that's the escape from it,

1159
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,240
but it's not.

1160
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:45,240
The escape is first step is to admit that the things that mean differently to you.

1161
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,240
Sometimes something means more,

1162
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,240
sometimes it means less.

1163
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,240
What you want to accept that responsibility for the difference significance

1164
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,240
and then overcome it,

1165
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,240
or rather, becomes stronger

1166
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,240
than the strongest significance you're experiencing in the world.

1167
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,240
You're feminine, usually.

1168
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,240
That's something like everybody's usually attached.

1169
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,240
You can't help but being attached to your family, to your children.

1170
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,240
So you don't want to deny it.

1171
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,240
You can't deny it,

1172
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,240
but you won't free you from the attachment.

1173
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,240
It will just cause denial, saying,

1174
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,240
that's not really my child.

1175
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,240
It's constantly changing, everything is constantly changing.

1176
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,240
No, it's your child.

1177
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,240
And he's changing while remaining your child.

1178
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,240
That's how things work.

1179
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,240
So you want to be able to fully accept responsibility

1180
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,240
for that being your child,

1181
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,240
for all the feelings you have,

1182
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,240
fully accept responsibility,

1183
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,240
and then become stronger than that responsibility.

1184
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,240
So when that child is taken away from you,

1185
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,240
one way or the other,

1186
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,240
your mind will not go with it.

1187
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,240
No, through denying that that was your child,

1188
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,240
but through becoming stronger,

1189
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,240
than any significance you can gather from the world.

1190
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,240
Because stronger, isn't it?

1191
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,240
It means not being moved by it.

1192
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,240
So if this door is very important to me,

1193
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,240
it was a gift made, whatever,

1194
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,240
I acknowledge all that,

1195
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,240
and I fully accept that,

1196
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,240
and fully responsibility.

1197
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,240
And yeah, if somebody asks,

1198
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,240
does this door mean more than that broom?

1199
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,240
I would say yes.

1200
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,240
It's more important,

1201
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,240
and it was a gift by a good friend or whatever else.

1202
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
He made it especially for me,

1203
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,240
and my God's welfare.

1204
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,240
And that's it's really such.

1205
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,240
So there's no point,

1206
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,240
there's no reason to deny that.

1207
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,240
Unless I believe the denial of that

1208
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,240
would free me from my attachment to it.

1209
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,240
But he won't.

1210
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,240
In order to free myself from the attachment

1211
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,240
of the important external object,

1212
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,240
he's through overcoming the significance of the external object

1213
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,240
without denying it.

1214
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,240
So you have to admit that it's important,

1215
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,240
and then become more stronger than that importance.

1216
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,240
So when the importance is taken away,

1217
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,240
when the thing that is important is taken away,

1218
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,240
you are not affected.

1219
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,240
So as the mundane right view,

1220
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,240
say to repeat again,

1221
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,240
there is mother,

1222
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,240
there is father.

1223
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,240
It doesn't go around saying,

1224
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,240
oh no, it's just collection of atoms,

1225
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,240
and everything is constantly changing.

1226
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,240
There is no mother,

1227
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,240
there is no father, there is nothing.

1228
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,240
And that's what Gwankha said.

1229
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,240
Which means Gwankha is not even a mundane right view.

1230
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,240
And he was just one of them,

1231
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,240
really.

1232
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,240
There's so many,

1233
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,240
like saying the same basically.

1234
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240
To become stronger,

1235
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,240
to overcome the needs of understanding.

1236
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,240
And understanding what,

1237
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,240
and understanding for myself?

1238
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,240
Understanding that actually,

1239
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,240
no matter how important to you is,

1240
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,240
it was inaccessible to you from the beginning.

1241
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,240
You could have not owned it from the start.

1242
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,240
The only reason you owned it,

1243
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,240
the only reason you were attached to it

1244
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,240
is because you didn't know that it's impossible to own it.

1245
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,240
When you know it's impossible to own,

1246
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,240
it's like a relief.

1247
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,240
And then, yeah,

1248
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,240
it's an important though.

1249
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,240
But it doesn't mean that I'll suffer if I lose it.

1250
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,240
No, it doesn't mean that I will be all carried away

1251
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,240
if I get another one.

1252
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,240
Suppose that's meant to child in that case,

1253
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,240
that you understand,

1254
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,240
not mine,

1255
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,240
it means actually how to understand it,

1256
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,240
it was separate.

1257
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,240
Well, again, first you have to accept it as yours,

1258
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,240
accept full responsibility for it,

1259
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,240
for all the feelings you had.

1260
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,240
And then, but becoming stronger than that,

1261
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,240
you can experience,

1262
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,240
well, a form of disson.

1263
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,240
So, you're not denying the significance of a child,

1264
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,240
or significance of a parent,

1265
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,240
or a mother or father,

1266
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:40,240
but means you develop yourself further than that significance.

1267
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,240
So, when the significant object disappears,

1268
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,240
eventually,

1269
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,240
means you won't be taken by it.

1270
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,240
And the reason, again,

1271
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,240
why Anitcha from the Sutras is different

1272
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,240
than Anitcha has been taught,

1273
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,240
as taught in the Sutras,

1274
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,240
by going out of it,

1275
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,240
because you don't actually have to wait for things to cease.

1276
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,240
You don't have to see the ending in order to see Anitcha.

1277
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,240
You know them that they are impermanent,

1278
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,240
while they are impermanent.

1279
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,240
Because they are impermanent.

1280
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,240
That's it.

1281
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,240
Why they are impermanent?

1282
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,240
Because they have a reason on their own.

1283
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,240
It's difficult point,

1284
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,240
and it's a different point.

1285
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,240
Because usually, see this tree got destroyed.

1286
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,240
Everything is impermanent.

1287
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,240
No, actually,

1288
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,240
when you're experiencing right there,

1289
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,240
there is the positive experience

1290
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
of a destruction of a tree.

1291
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,240
And that's a present experience,

1292
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,240
which means, actually,

1293
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,240
nothing can cease,

1294
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,240
there is another experience right there.

1295
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,240
But if you are concerned about the things in the world,

1296
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,240
as fundamental,

1297
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,240
then yes, the destruction of the tree will mean impermanence.

1298
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,240
But it doesn't.

1299
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,240
The impermanence from the Sutras refers to the impermanence,

1300
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,240
impermanent nature of your experience,

1301
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,240
of your five aggregates.

1302
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,240
But unless,

1303
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,240
the moment when you die,

1304
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,240
you won't experience the ending,

1305
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,240
which means, a nature from the Sutras

1306
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,240
is different than a nature that you can observe in your senses.

1307
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,240
And it is different,

1308
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,240
because if you weren't,

1309
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,240
you wouldn't need a bullet to teach on each and another.

1310
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,240
You could just see it yourself,

1311
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,240
with your eyes,

1312
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,240
or here with your ears.

1313
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,240
Oh, yes, it's impermanent.

1314
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,240
I saw it.

1315
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,240
Because when you see a destruction of a house,

1316
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,240
again,

1317
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,240
experience of seeing a destruction of a house

1318
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,240
has a reason,

1319
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,240
which means there's no impermanence there.

1320
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,240
It's on the relative impermanence

1321
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,240
of a certain house changing its shape,

1322
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,240
from being a useful or in-shape useful for inhabiting.

1323
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,240
Now it's a less useful shape of a pile of rubble.

1324
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,240
It's still something you're perceiving,

1325
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,240
so you just perceive a different perception

1326
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:03,240
that you externally explain to yourself as change.

1327
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,240
Just see what I mean.

1328
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,240
No, no.

1329
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,240
You can ask a question there.

1330
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,240
You said this is what has arisen with it.

1331
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,240
It is impermanent.

1332
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,240
I actually don't understand.

1333
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,240
Again, let's take the example of a house.

1334
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,240
You look at the house.

1335
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,240
You have the experience of seeing a house.

1336
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,240
Experience as a whole.

1337
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,240
We're not just talking about a house,

1338
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,240
because it's never just a house.

1339
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,240
You are always in every situation.

1340
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,240
Even when you think about the situation,

1341
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,240
that you are not present in,

1342
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,240
you are present in your thoughts.

1343
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,240
Mentally, that's your situation.

1344
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,240
So you cannot leave yourself out.

1345
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,240
Which means there is no objective scientific world

1346
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,240
everybody talks about.

1347
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,240
The only world you know is the one you can perceive.

1348
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,240
So when you look at a house,

1349
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,240
that's the experience of seeing a house.

1350
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,240
Now, somebody starts destroying a house.

1351
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,240
That's the experience of seeing a house being destroyed.

1352
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,240
It's another experience.

1353
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:05,240
Impermanence that the Buddha talks about

1354
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,240
pertains to the experience of any kind.

1355
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,240
Not of the specific house,

1356
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,240
a tree or a child.

1357
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,240
Experience in itself is impermanent.

1358
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,240
Because it has a reason on its own.

1359
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:22,240
So basically when you are experiencing the perception of the house,

1360
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:26,240
your experience is known as impermanent.

1361
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,240
As a result of that,

1362
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,240
any ownership that you have to your house,

1363
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,240
will disappear even in that house and remain standing.

1364
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,240
So destroying the house,

1365
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,240
setting it on fire,

1366
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,240
makes no difference to the internal impermanence.

1367
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,240
Nothing to do because it's another experience.

1368
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,240
Are there?

1369
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,240
Sometimes having a house being destroyed

1370
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,240
can possibly remind you of

1371
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,240
if you already know it first,

1372
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,240
not if you don't know it.

1373
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,240
That actually it was impermanent to begin with.

1374
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,240
It was impermanent while it was still standing.

1375
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,240
And look, now it's being destroyed.

1376
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,240
Of course, it was always impermanent.

1377
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,240
Subject to destruction means it can be destroyed.

1378
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,240
It will be destroyed.

1379
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,240
It doesn't mean necessarily it's being destroyed while I'm staring at it.

1380
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,240
Do you see the difference here?

1381
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,240
Yeah, actually,

1382
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,240
this is where the house is implemented or not.

1383
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,240
If I don't have experience with that,

1384
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,240
there's no any problem with people.

1385
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,240
So the only reason people use

1386
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,240
that they say western science

1387
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,240
so they say everything is impermanent.

1388
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,240
Just observe sensations.

1389
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,240
Everything is constantly changing.

1390
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,240
It's basically to deny

1391
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,240
the responsibility for it,

1392
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,240
believing that's the escape.

1393
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,240
But it's not.

1394
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,240
It's a completely wrong direction.

1395
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,240
If you want a escape,

1396
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,240
you first want to admit that the thing

1397
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,240
means something to you or not.

1398
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,240
And then without abandoning that responsibility,

1399
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,240
or not.

1400
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,240
And you don't have to witness

1401
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,240
or have it destroyed in order to prove to yourself

1402
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,240
that it was impermanent.

1403
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,240
Meaning, if you needed to prove to yourself externally,

1404
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,240
it means you were never sure about it internal,

1405
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,240
which means there is no knowledge.

1406
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,240
Hmm.

1407
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,240
Why would the thought fall to all the body?

1408
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,240
It didn't.

1409
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,240
It didn't.

1410
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,240
No.

1411
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,240
Never like that.

1412
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,240
He would say you observe parts of the body,

1413
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,240
like lungs or whatever,

1414
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,240
like all of the context of my body,

1415
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,240
my strong healthy body.

1416
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,240
So to experience this past,

1417
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,240
this passion in regard to that body.

1418
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,240
If you just think of a parallel lung,

1419
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,240
it's quite disgusting.

1420
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,240
And then parallel lung,

1421
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,240
that's exactly what I have in me.

1422
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,240
If you think about intestines,

1423
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,240
and it's skin, hair,

1424
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,240
think about that,

1425
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,240
it will make you experience this passion.

1426
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,240
Because it's not beautiful.

1427
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,240
He didn't teach sweet associations

1428
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,240
and being aware of your kneecap,

1429
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,240
or whatever else.

1430
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,240
No, it was a contemplation of bringing those things to mind

1431
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,240
so to experience this passion.

1432
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,240
You're doing long enough,

1433
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,240
then even when you don't have those things in your mind,

1434
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,240
just being aware of your body will be seen

1435
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,240
as those healthy things.

1436
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,240
Hmm.

1437
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:16,240
It's very interesting.

1438
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,240
I think many people write an entire diver,

1439
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,240
and many people write a body contemplation,

1440
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,240
and write that body.

1441
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,240
Yeah, that's what I have done.

1442
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,240
It's for that reason.

1443
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,240
Because usually people don't think about death,

1444
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,240
don't want to think about death, don't see death.

1445
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,240
So seeing a dead body

1446
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,240
or things of their nature

1447
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,240
will all remind you.

1448
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,240
I cannot escape this.

1449
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,240
This will happen to me.

1450
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,240
So you experience this passion towards your life,

1451
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,240
towards life of others,

1452
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,240
towards you realize, oh,

1453
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,240
it will all end like this.

1454
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,240
It's a reminder of something

1455
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,240
that kind of everybody knows

1456
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,240
in the back of their mind.

1457
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,240
Obviously, it's not, again,

1458
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,240
there is no wisdom.

1459
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,240
People can go bit funny in regard to it,

1460
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,240
because it can be too much of a shock or something,

1461
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,240
and then they can go mad

1462
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,240
as they did in the suitors,

1463
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,240
and they really practiced

1464
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,240
hard contemplation of death.

1465
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,240
The Buddha went out for the retreat.

1466
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,240
Obviously, they came back as like

1467
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,240
maybe half of the monks left.

1468
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,240
So what happened to the rest of the world?

1469
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,240
They were jumping off the cliffs and stuff,

1470
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,240
because they were,

1471
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,240
and he said, okay, well, in that case,

1472
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,240
practice mindfulness of breathing.

1473
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,240
They have one result

1474
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,240
in such extreme actions.

1475
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,240
Obviously, if somebody does

1476
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,240
Maranusati correctly,

1477
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,240
they can become Maran very quickly.

1478
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,240
Because it's a fairer,

1479
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,240
direct, forceful, dispassion.

1480
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,240
Mad.

1481
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,240
Yeah, I did it.

1482
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,240
It's very interesting.

1483
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,240
Attachment of the child also,

1484
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,240
it means that it's experience.

1485
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,240
Yeah, it's real.

1486
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,240
It's real as such.

1487
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,240
People think they can deal with attachment

1488
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,240
by denying it, by saying, well,

1489
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,240
it's not really, it's just atoms,

1490
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,240
it's molecule.

1491
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,240
So I don't need to see, like,

1492
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,240
the child's body is changing.

1493
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,240
No, it's irrelevant.

1494
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,240
You have to accept the responsibility

1495
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,240
for your feelings. You must not deny it.

1496
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,240
You have to accept

1497
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,240
the weight, the significance

1498
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,240
of having your child.

1499
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,240
And that's how you can overcome.

1500
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,240
And that experience is important.

1501
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,240
Yeah.

1502
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,240
That's what impermanence pretends to.

1503
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,240
Experience is important.

1504
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,240
It means it's changing.

1505
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,240
No, it means it will come to rent.

1506
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,240
Even if you don't see it in the server.

1507
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,240
That's very important.

1508
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,240
You have to accept it in the server.

1509
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,240
As the server said,

1510
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,240
whatever has the nature of rising

1511
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,240
has the nature of ceasing.

1512
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,240
Even if you're not witnessing the ceasing,

1513
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,240
just in its nature,

1514
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,240
it will be affected by ceasing.

1515
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,240
It will cease.

1516
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,240
It will come to rent.

1517
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,240
Why? Because it has a reason.

1518
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,240
Because its nature has manifested.

1519
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,240
For that reason,

1520
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,240
it will have to go.

1521
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,240
Nothing else.

1522
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,240
No, because molecules are changing.

1523
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,240
No, because somebody can come and destroy it.

1524
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,240
Just because it has appeared.

1525
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,240
Is there any...

1526
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,240
Is there any nibbana in common?

1527
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,240
Is it true?

1528
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,240
No.

1529
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,240
No.

1530
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,240
Because permanent nibbana doesn't apply

1531
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,240
to nibbana.

1532
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,240
Because nibbana cannot even be dead.

1533
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,240
Any designations?

1534
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,240
Applied to things.

1535
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,240
Any bana means surpassing all that.

1536
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,240
It doesn't make sense.

1537
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,240
And there is that, I think...

1538
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,240
It's true.

1539
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,240
True available.

1540
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,240
When Bikuni,

1541
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,240
Damodino was answering the questions

1542
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,240
of her ex-husband.

1543
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,240
And he was asking,

1544
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,240
where does this lead?

1545
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,240
And they came to a point that

1546
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,240
well, that leads to nibbana.

1547
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,240
Well, where does nibbana lead?

1548
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,240
What's nibbana is?

1549
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,240
Well, the point of your questioning

1550
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,240
cannot be applied to nibbana.

1551
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,240
That's any answer I give you won't make any sense.

1552
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,240
Or it could be completely misspecived.

1553
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,240
And is there any kind of decision?

1554
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,240
The least of 32 designations

1555
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,240
for nibbana, like, describing another shore?

1556
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,240
All right.

1557
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,240
Definitely.

1558
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,240
Niche.

1559
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,240
Permanent.

1560
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,240
Well, I guess I have read that sort of.

1561
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,240
But if you mean in terms of nibbana,

1562
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,240
the other shore,

1563
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,240
is the definition of

1564
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,240
greater version of illusion,

1565
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,240
free from bondage,

1566
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,240
whatever else.

1567
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,240
And if you say in that sense,

1568
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,240
as here you could just talk about this,

1569
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,240
I can see that if you say in that sense,

1570
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,240
or it's permanent,

1571
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,240
from the point of view of the impermanent that you're living in,

1572
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,240
then yeah.

1573
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,240
But you can't say it's permanent in last forever.

1574
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,240
Because if something,

1575
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,240
usually if people say permanent,

1576
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,240
they mean eternal.

1577
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:03,240
Permanent in eternal.

1578
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,240
Eternal means basically

1579
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,240
when things are taken as self,

1580
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,240
it will last forever.

1581
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,240
And that's usually the sense of permanence.

1582
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,240
Like a soul or something.

1583
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,240
So if somebody said nibbana is permanent,

1584
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,240
by quoting this sutra,

1585
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,240
that's okay. But then it should be clarified

1586
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,240
that it's in the context

1587
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,240
from the point of view of the impermanent.

1588
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,240
But if they say nibbana is permanent,

1589
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,240
means once you enter it,

1590
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,240
it lasts forever. That makes no sense.

1591
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,240
Because the idea of lasting and time

1592
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,240
cannot pertain to timeless nibbana.

1593
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,240
So permanent as pertaining,

1594
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,240
referring to time,

1595
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,240
usually cannot pertain to the timeless nibbana.

1596
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,240
It doesn't make sense.

1597
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,240
Unless you use it as evidence

1598
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,240
to describe it,

1599
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,240
in which case you should probably clarify it as such.

1600
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,240
It's not right to say it.

1601
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,240
Sansa or it's permanent

1602
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:56,240
only based on determination that it's self.

1603
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,240
Again, it's not permanent.

1604
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,240
It's just that

1605
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,240
it's going to be occurring

1606
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,240
for as long as you don't see

1607
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,240
the nature of it and escape it.

1608
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,240
But then, again,

1609
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,240
saying permanent or impermanent

1610
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,240
cannot really designate that correctly.

1611
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,240
Unless you're using to inspire somebody

1612
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,240
to say them, yeah, from your point of view

1613
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,240
of this soul impermanence,

1614
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,240
this is the permanent, this is the stable,

1615
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,240
from suffering, sure.

1616
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,240
But in terms of, if you use permanent

1617
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,240
as a designation of time

1618
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,240
last forever,

1619
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,240
it doesn't work like that.

1620
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,240
What has arisen

1621
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,240
it is impermanent.

1622
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,240
It is just a raw nature.

1623
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,240
It just must understand it.

1624
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,240
What has arisen

1625
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,240
that they experience?

1626
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,240
It is impermanent.

1627
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,240
But sometimes, because

1628
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,240
the user, we don't see the beginning

1629
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,240
at the end, it's quite

1630
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,240
different to receive it.

1631
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,240
You know, to see that correctly,

1632
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,240
what is arisen is impermanent,

1633
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,240
because the arisen first

1634
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,240
you have to accept it,

1635
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,240
and what is arisen is real.

1636
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,240
Even if it's a fantasy in your thoughts,

1637
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,240
it's really a search,

1638
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,240
and then you have to accept

1639
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,240
responsibility for it.

1640
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,240
And then, through that,

1641
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,240
it's interesting by itself.

1642
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,240
But if, kind of,

1643
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,240
catch up, and try to do it

1644
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,240
before,

1645
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,240
basically means you'll be,

1646
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,240
it will become a part of the narrative.

1647
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,240
I think that the only,

1648
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,240
only way to show the

1649
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,240
impermanence is clear.

1650
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,240
It supports, like, two Christian people

1651
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,240
who never accept Dharma,

1652
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,240
they have a Buddhism.

1653
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,240
For them, what we can do,

1654
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:50,240
is to prove the experience,

1655
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,240
just to think,

1656
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,240
impermanence is quite different

1657
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,240
to the experience,

1658
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,240
but attention changes.

1659
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,240
That's the only way

1660
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,240
to explain impermanence.

1661
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,240
Well, I don't think they'll get it like that.

1662
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,240
First, they have to be willing

1663
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,240
to follow,

1664
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,240
not just Christians,

1665
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,240
or wherever you're talking,

1666
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,240
even Buddhists actually.

1667
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,240
Because if they think they already know it,

1668
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,240
whatever you say,

1669
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,240
will fall on their fears.

1670
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,240
So, saying everything is changing

1671
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,240
will be okay, so what?

1672
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,240
I think it's closer,

1673
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,240
probably, to say, well,

1674
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,240
the fact that you will die,

1675
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,240
the fact that you don't really know what's after your life,

1676
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,240
you can't be sure.

1677
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,240
Do you really want to spend your life

1678
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,240
based on the mere belief,

1679
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,240
and mere faith,

1680
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,240
in an imaginary friend,

1681
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,240
or something like that?

1682
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,240
You cannot verify.

1683
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,240
The God exists as such,

1684
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,240
the heaven exists as such,

1685
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,240
the Jesus exists as such.

1686
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,240
You'll be saved for sure.

1687
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,240
How can you be sure?

1688
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,240
Even if you do everything rightly

1689
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,240
for the rest of your life,

1690
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,240
as the Jesus prescribed,

1691
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,240
or whoever, in the Bible,

1692
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,240
you still cannot be 100% sure

1693
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,240
that then will be the outcome.

1694
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,240
So, your entire life,

1695
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,240
all of your actions,

1696
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,240
are rooted in faith,

1697
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,240
in just blind faith,

1698
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,240
and that's why it's unwholesome.

1699
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,240
If someone is suffering,

1700
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,240
suffering from sickness,

1701
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,240
like a terminal,

1702
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:27,240
then if they ask us,

1703
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,240
how to be free from suffering,

1704
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,240
in the case of Putu,

1705
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:31,240
generally,

1706
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,240
it might be a bit late for them at that point.

1707
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,240
If we just tell them

1708
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,240
that the things have arisen,

1709
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,240
it is important.

1710
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,240
If they've been practicing throughout their life,

1711
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,240
then, yeah, you could remind them

1712
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,240
of the dharma in the Sultansan,

1713
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,240
but if they haven't,

1714
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,240
you can't say anything.

1715
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,240
It's very difficult point

1716
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,240
that you've been in the Lanyana,

1717
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,240
but it is for the name, sickness.

1718
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,240
So, the pain that depends on someone

1719
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,240
is really serious and sick.

1720
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,240
Because pain is everything.

1721
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,240
Well, the most you can say

1722
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,240
to a person who never practice

1723
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,240
and the most of the death is

1724
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,240
life.

1725
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,240
Provided they were good things that they've done.

1726
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,240
If they haven't well,

1727
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,240
then try to think

1728
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,240
good things now,

1729
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,240
but they might be a bit late,

1730
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,240
but obviously.

1731
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,240
When I'm sick,

1732
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,240
doesn't mean I observe.

1733
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,240
I can see as relief with attention,

1734
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,240
definitely changes.

1735
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,240
All the time, we never think about the pain.

1736
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,240
Pain is present all the time,

1737
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,240
but we are thinking about many other things.

1738
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,240
We are thinking about the object

1739
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,240
and the only thing that's going to

1740
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,240
understand the impermanence.

1741
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,240
No, no, no.

1742
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,240
As I said,

1743
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,240
you don't have to keep witnessing the change

1744
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,240
to understand impermanence.

1745
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,240
You have to recognize

1746
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,240
independent arising of things,

1747
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,240
arising on their own

1748
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,240
in order to recognize impermanence.

1749
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,240
They're not impermanence

1750
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,240
because they're not impermanent

1751
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,240
because they're going to come to an end.

1752
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,240
In the first place.

1753
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,240
So they will have to come to an end.

1754
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,240
Not to come to an end.

1755
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,240
So you start worrying about cessation of things,

1756
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,240
start looking in their arising.

1757
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,240
If they have a reason,

1758
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,240
you have no say in it.

1759
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,240
You have no say in arising of your thoughts.

1760
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,240
You have some say in what you're going to attend,

1761
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,240
once it has a reason.

1762
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,240
But the fact that

1763
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,240
it will always arise on its own.

1764
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,240
I heard that Feng Anaman Yanemi

1765
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,240
was doing walking meditation

1766
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,240
and he already proven his

1767
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,240
what he was doing.

1768
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,240
How to understand.

1769
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,240
I mean,

1770
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,240
I simply heard that

1771
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,240
what he was doing is the need to receive.

1772
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,240
But how?

1773
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,240
How is it quite hard

1774
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,240
to understand that?

1775
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,240
It is because if you would,

1776
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,240
you would be a subtle body.

1777
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,240
But what he kept observing?

1778
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,240
The very good experience.

1779
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,240
Well, he was pondering and reflecting on Dhamma.

1780
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:03,240
He was pondering on the nature of our arising.

1781
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,240
So you lined up three people

1782
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,240
and you did an experiment of them.

1783
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,240
And you forget that you are the one observing the experiment.

1784
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,240
So if you are focused on your experiment,

1785
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:17,240
you will be able to see yourself experimenting.

1786
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,240
But if you see yourself experimenting,

1787
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,240
you can stop doing experiments.

1788
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,240
You can just see yourself doing whatever.

1789
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,240
So the lay you maintain mind for instance,

1790
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,240
already you see the background that moved

1791
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,240
the way how you are feeling

1792
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,240
the mental state that in the

1793
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,240
relation to the situation,

1794
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,240
you can see how that affects you

1795
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,240
on a particular level.

1796
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,240
What it makes you think, what it makes you choose,

1797
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,240
what it makes you dwell on.

1798
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,240
And if it makes you dwell on the bad things

1799
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,240
because you're in bad mood,

1800
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,240
well, you can choose to dwell on not bad things.

1801
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,240
Or you can choose to not dwell on bad things.

1802
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,240
Or you dwell on good things

1803
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,240
while you're in a bad mood.

1804
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,240
You keep dwelling on good things

1805
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,240
or more inspiring things.

1806
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,240
And yeah, you can change that mood.

1807
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,240
Because the mood is not completely independent

1808
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,240
from a particular situation either.

1809
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,240
From a particular

1810
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,240
thoughts or perceptions.

1811
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,240
But always it's on a different level.

1812
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,240
They are simultaneously there,

1813
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,240
but on a different level.

1814
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,240
So I think exactly,

1815
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,240
we don't need to know that the

1816
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:23,240
fear of this body is in it. It's not that important.

1817
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,240
I did the mood.

1818
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,240
So in that case,

1819
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,240
this body is now in the court.

1820
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,240
It's not that important.

1821
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,240
You don't have to think about the location.

1822
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,240
But you have to think about you in the situation.

1823
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,240
Which is your body in the situation.

1824
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,240
So whether it's you and you could there,

1825
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,240
you're in a talk talk,

1826
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,240
or you're walking on a path,

1827
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,240
you in a certain location,

1828
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,240
which is what makes the whole situation.

1829
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,240
Thinking about the kutti in the shape of the walls,

1830
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:53,240
just have to know that you are in that situation.

1831
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,240
And the bodily posture

1832
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,240
is like the first kind of

1833
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:01,240
first designation of your situation.

1834
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,240
You're seated in such and such place.

1835
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,240
You're standing in such and such.

1836
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,240
It's like the most fundamental

1837
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,240
external output you're in.

1838
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,240
Because while you're seated,

1839
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,240
you can't have intentions of,

1840
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,240
you know, based on your standing,

1841
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,240
or based on your walking,

1842
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,240
or based on your lying down.

1843
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,240
That's why being aware of your bodily posture

1844
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:25,240
kind of makes you aware of the whole situation already.

1845
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,240
But being aware of your bodily posture

1846
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,240
has a background.

1847
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,240
Not as a kind of going, observing sensation.

1848
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1849
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,240
It's actually very different that there is a mood

1850
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,240
in the mental state.

1851
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,240
Seeing it as general background is quite hard.

1852
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,240
Something with appears in front.

1853
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,240
Well, if it appears in front,

1854
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,240
then there is something appearing in front.

1855
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,240
But there is always a background to it.

1856
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,240
So that doesn't mean that you lost the sight of your background.

1857
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,240
Unless you got confused.

1858
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,240
Supposedly that mood is in there.

1859
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,240
Any mood is in there.

1860
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,240
Happy or whatever.

1861
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,240
It is not in front.

1862
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,240
I have seated background.

1863
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,240
Yeah.

1864
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,240
But you can say, oh, I am happy.

1865
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,240
And that doesn't mean that your background

1866
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,240
will not change suddenly.

1867
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,240
You can still be happy.

1868
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,240
You shouldn't confuse that you saying I am happy

1869
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,240
is your happiness.

1870
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,240
Happiness is the state of mind,

1871
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,240
which is always in the background.

1872
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,240
The purpose of the practices

1873
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,240
to understand the intention.

1874
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,240
That the important.

1875
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
Yeah, to overcome it.

1876
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,240
To understand it, to overcome.

1877
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:33,240
But recognizing that the things arise on their own,

1878
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,240
by not being moved by your mood,

1879
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,240
wholesome or unwholesome,

1880
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:41,240
you end up like, well, you stop appropriating it.

1881
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:45,240
You see, ah, this thing doesn't require sense of self.

1882
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,240
Sense of self becomes part of that mood.

1883
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,240
Me just becomes part of that whole picture

1884
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,240
of background and of general in particular.

1885
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:57,240
And by not knowing general in particular,

1886
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,240
you were centered on yourself.

1887
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,240
But now you recognize this operates without a self.

1888
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,240
So the center from yourself is removed.

1889
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,240
And when the center is not in the self,

1890
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,240
that's not self.

1891
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,240
Mm-hmm.

1892
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,240
Mm-hmm.

1893
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,240
Actually, the center for you,

1894
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,240
for the area, I believe in self in that.

1895
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,240
Actually, if I sink,

1896
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,240
or you actually serve before me in common.

1897
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,240
It's up to me, because the fans fear this body thing.

1898
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,240
Actually, according to the situation,

1899
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,240
fear this body thing.

1900
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,240
Actually, the mood changes.

1901
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,240
I mean, it's quite strange,

1902
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,240
but that is really self.

1903
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,240
It wouldn't change.

1904
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:37,240
But you are, it's something that needs to be,

1905
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,240
you have to dwell on it, on and on.

1906
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,240
Because the self is also,

1907
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,240
you see it once,

1908
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,240
you have to keep dwelling on it.

1909
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,240
That it cannot be on,

1910
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,240
that it's subject to cessation,

1911
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,240
because it's already there.

1912
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,240
Because you have no sense.

1913
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,240
And if you dwell on it long enough,

1914
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,240
then you stop feeling its mind.

1915
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,240
Mm-hmm.

1916
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,240
It means there's no meaning

1917
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,240
that to keep seeing it, it's arising in tension.

1918
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,240
If it has already,

1919
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,240
it is given in tension,

1920
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,240
so it is not mind.

1921
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,240
If I keep observing,

1922
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,240
there's no point of reading it.

1923
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,240
Well, there is no point,

1924
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,240
because if you do it like that,

1925
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,240
you end up not taking responsibility for it.

1926
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,240
First, you have to learn

1927
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,240
how to always be responsible for that.

1928
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,240
And then you can start saying,

1929
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,240
yeah, this is not mind,

1930
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,240
through that responsibility,

1931
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,240
the order of things is important.

1932
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,240
All the externally might be the same.

1933
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,240
Yes, this doesn't belong to me.

1934
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,240
It depends whether you said it before,

1935
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,240
you took full responsibility or after.

1936
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,240
If you said before,

1937
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,240
means you obscure the responsibility,

1938
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,240
you obscure the feeling,

1939
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,240
you obscure the camera.

1940
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,240
But if you do it after,

1941
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,240
then how? Okay.

1942
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,240
Without abandoning, which means you don't do it

1943
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,240
for the reasons

1944
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,240
of avoiding responsibility,

1945
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,240
which is why people do it.

1946
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,240
No, you accept responsibility,

1947
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
you don't fear responsibility,

1948
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,240
no matter how fearful it is,

1949
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,240
and then you do it.

1950
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,240
And then it can apply to responsibility.

1951
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,240
But if you want to avoid responsibility and do it,

1952
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,240
there's nothing,

1953
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,240
because it can only apply to responsibility,

1954
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
but because you avoid it,

1955
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,240
there's nothing to apply to it.

1956
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,240
So you end up just keep doing,

1957
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,240
keep saying, keep denying,

1958
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,240
but it doesn't really lead anywhere.

1959
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,240
You just try to suppose,

1960
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:55,240
but it doesn't really lead anywhere.
