00:00.000 --> 00:21.600
So this is from the shorter note on Dhamma.

00:21.600 --> 00:29.160
The word Dhamma, in its most general sense, is equivalent to thing, i.e. whatever is distinct

00:29.160 --> 00:36.160
from anything else, more precisely, is what the thing is in itself, as opposed to how it

00:36.160 --> 00:44.440
is in the footnote to that reads, how a thing is a matter of structure, that is to say of

00:44.440 --> 00:49.360
intentions, chaitana, or determinations, sankara.

00:49.360 --> 00:58.760
These are essentially negative, whereas Dhamma is positive.

00:58.760 --> 01:10.120
So in terms of that, he's distinguishing what a thing is, versus how a thing is, but it may

01:10.120 --> 01:16.760
not be obvious that those are two things that can be distinguished in the first place, so

01:16.760 --> 01:17.760
to speak.

01:17.760 --> 01:25.960
I was wondering if you had anything to comment or add about how you would discern a thing

01:25.960 --> 01:29.200
from its determinations, so to speak.

01:29.200 --> 01:38.560
Well, okay, so that's where you only saw Manasakara comes in, basically knowing how to attend

01:38.560 --> 01:43.920
a thing without making it another thing, without making it a different thing.

01:43.920 --> 01:52.000
So in this particular passage you read, Dhamma is anything that has a nature to manifest

01:52.000 --> 01:54.040
itself.

01:54.040 --> 01:58.640
So a feeling, a thought, a perception, a memory, it doesn't matter.

01:58.640 --> 02:03.680
If it's a reason experience as such, it's a thing, it's a Dhamma.

02:03.680 --> 02:14.400
So you will discern then what that thing is determined by simultaneously being able to

02:14.400 --> 02:19.920
discern what's present there within that thing that it isn't that thing.

02:19.920 --> 02:30.040
Now the problem is this requires quite a refined, as in proper way, of attending to the fundamental

02:30.040 --> 02:31.720
core of the arisen thing.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.840
That's why Journeys, Manasakara, Journeys, so literally means womb, means going back

02:35.840 --> 02:40.520
to the womb, attending to the womb of the arisen thing, that it's simultaneously their

02:40.520 --> 02:43.680
present, attending to its base.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.280
That's what proper attention means in the suttas.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.800
The problem that people have is if that proper attention is not developed and trained and

02:50.800 --> 02:55.720
discerned, what you're going to do is when there is a, say, a thing A has arisen, instead

02:55.720 --> 03:04.240
of seeing through it into not A, still within A, but not that A, people, when they look,

03:04.240 --> 03:10.800
they overlook, so then they see B, and B is just another thing.

03:10.800 --> 03:17.320
And when they look for the Sankara for the determination of the experience B, well they

03:17.320 --> 03:22.240
see C, which means they're not seeing these things simultaneously present, they're following

03:22.240 --> 03:26.920
them in time, they're following them linearly or logically.

03:26.920 --> 03:31.720
And that's why they can't understand the true nature of Sankara, because if a person

03:31.720 --> 03:36.920
would understand that, that's the beginning of Patitsang Pada.

03:36.920 --> 03:43.160
So the present experience of such and such nature, without abandoning that experience,

03:43.160 --> 03:48.280
without over-intending it, without under-intending it, you want to discern peripherally in regard

03:48.280 --> 03:50.960
to the present experience, what else is there?

03:50.960 --> 03:56.240
That's what I meant in the previous video about Kama, when I said the intentionality

03:56.240 --> 04:02.160
behind your actions, the degree of those intentions it's given beforehand as options,

04:02.160 --> 04:06.200
and that's not what you're doing, nor it is your responsibility.

04:06.200 --> 04:11.120
Not being able to see it on that level, you will automatically appropriate it, overly

04:11.120 --> 04:17.880
intended, which means make it mine, which means result in acting out of it.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.640
So if you want to discern the determination of the present, there is an experience of

04:21.640 --> 04:25.480
Dama, you need to see it within that present experience of Dama.

04:25.480 --> 04:31.040
That's why every Patitsang Pada starts with this, this is, with two simultaneous present

04:31.040 --> 04:37.960
things, because yes, when you look at Sankara's individually, not in the context of determining

04:37.960 --> 04:43.120
Dama, there are also things, which means there are also Damas, as the Buddha described that,

04:43.120 --> 04:46.160
when he was describing the five aggregates.

04:46.160 --> 04:50.800
But you don't want to look for the content of Sankara, or the content of Dama, you want

04:50.800 --> 04:56.560
to see the relationship between Dama, and that which determines it, which is not Dama,

04:56.560 --> 04:57.960
that particular Dama.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.920
So you want to see the relationship between A, and that which is simultaneously present,

05:01.920 --> 05:08.800
that it's not that A, but not B either.

05:08.800 --> 05:14.320
So by not giving into A, but not making it into B, by not confusing the two, you get

05:14.320 --> 05:19.480
to understand how A is presently determined, presently a reason with presently a reason

05:19.480 --> 05:21.840
causes as well.

05:21.840 --> 05:27.720
And that's why when they ask the Buddha, he says, how did you cross, he said, you can't

05:27.720 --> 05:30.880
cross the shore by fighting the waves, by pulling backwards, by standing still.

05:30.880 --> 05:37.000
So how did you cross the shores, by not fighting the waves, by not pulling backwards, by not

05:37.000 --> 05:38.560
standing still?

05:38.560 --> 05:42.280
He has crossed the stream, the river.

05:42.280 --> 05:47.880
But the problem people have is, because it's a form of fighting the wave, over intending

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
it.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.800
Because there is in Dama A, I look for its cause as in I'm looking for B, to determine

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
A.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.520
And that's what most people misunderstood, but it's own bother.

05:56.520 --> 06:01.080
They think it's an explanation of the life of the three life stages and so on.

06:01.080 --> 06:05.400
They think it's laid out in time from A, B, C, D, E, E, F, G, and so on.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
But it isn't.

06:06.400 --> 06:12.120
It's always, always starts with the present there isn't principle of with this, this

06:12.120 --> 06:14.120
is, that's it.

06:14.120 --> 06:19.160
And then the Buddha would elaborate differently within the same principle, depending on who

06:19.160 --> 06:20.160
he was teaching.

06:20.160 --> 06:25.360
But sometimes, but it's a part of describing twelve factors, sometimes in eight, sometimes

06:25.360 --> 06:27.440
in sixteen, it doesn't matter.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.880
What matters is, the simultaneous principle, the principle of simultaneous dependence.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.520
And if you want to see what A depends upon, you can't look for B, you have to look within

06:37.520 --> 06:39.520
A, which it is a name.

06:39.520 --> 06:45.320
So it's about letting Dama's endure and then not looking elsewhere.

06:45.320 --> 06:51.840
No trying to explain the Dama, as, no trying to explain there is a thing, but allowing

06:51.840 --> 06:56.880
it to arise and allowing it to persist and endure and while it persists and endures,

06:56.880 --> 07:02.160
you get to see what else is there within it that determines it.

07:02.160 --> 07:06.880
And that's not that Dama, it's some kind of that Dama.

07:06.880 --> 07:12.200
But if you look at B, well then you need to look now to, to find its own Sankara within

07:12.200 --> 07:17.400
that B, not like start drawing connections between A and B and then provide an explanation

07:17.400 --> 07:24.960
to yourself what the determination is.

07:24.960 --> 07:33.880
So this is going on to the next paragraph now, so it's Sabei Sankara Nitya, Sabei Sankara

07:33.880 --> 07:38.000
Nitya, Sabei Dama Anata.

07:38.000 --> 07:46.400
All determinations are impermanence, all determinations are unpleasurable, all things are not self.

07:46.400 --> 07:55.800
Ata self is fundamentally a notion of mastery over things, but this notion is entertained

07:55.800 --> 08:01.880
only if it is pleasurable, it is only pleasurable provided the mastery is soon be permanent

08:01.880 --> 08:08.120
for mastery, which is essentially a kind of absolute timelessness unmoved moving of things

08:08.120 --> 08:13.520
as undermined by impermanence is no mastery at all but a mockery.

08:13.520 --> 08:19.760
Thus regarding of a thing, A-Dama as Ata or self can survive for only as so long as the

08:19.760 --> 08:24.520
notion gives pleasure and it only gives pleasure for so long as that Dama can be considered

08:24.520 --> 08:29.400
as permanent for regarding a thing as self and dows it with the illusion of the kind of

08:29.400 --> 08:32.440
super stability in time.

08:32.440 --> 08:38.760
In itself as a Dama regarded as Ata, its impermanence is not manifest for it is pleasant

08:38.760 --> 08:43.680
to consider it as permanent, but when it is seen to be dependent upon other Dama, not

08:43.680 --> 08:48.280
considered to be permanent, its impermanence does then become manifest.

08:48.280 --> 08:53.840
To see impermanence in what is regarded as Ata, one must emerge from the confines of

08:53.840 --> 08:59.780
the individual Dama itself and see that it depends on what is impermanence, thus Sabe

08:59.780 --> 09:07.440
Sankara, Nattana, Anicha is said, meaning all things that things Dama depend on are

09:07.440 --> 09:08.440
impermanent.

09:08.440 --> 09:14.840
A given Dama as a Dama regarded as Ata is not account to being so regarded, considered

09:14.840 --> 09:19.360
to be pleasant, but when it is seen to be dependent upon some other Dama that not being

09:19.360 --> 09:25.120
regarded as Ata is manifestly unpleasurable owing to the invariable false perception

09:25.120 --> 09:31.440
of impermanence of super stability in one not free from the conceit I am, then its own

09:31.440 --> 09:38.880
unpleasurableness becomes manifest, thus Sabe Sankara, Nattana, Nuka is said, when this

09:38.880 --> 09:43.960
is seen, i.e. when perception of permanence and pleasure is understood to be false, the

09:43.960 --> 09:53.800
notion this Dama is my Ata comes to an end and is replaced with Sabe, Dama and Ata.

09:53.800 --> 09:59.960
So before you ask the question, just to add to that, that's a commonly kind of mis-misread

09:59.960 --> 10:04.840
with people say, oh yeah, the Buddha said all things are impermanent, all things are suffering,

10:04.840 --> 10:06.840
all things are not self.

10:06.840 --> 10:14.720
That's what I mean when you kind of overly intend and basically use Dama that ends up

10:14.720 --> 10:18.400
being an explanation, just provides an explanation that everything is impermanent and everything

10:18.400 --> 10:21.080
is not yours and everything is not yourself.

10:21.080 --> 10:26.000
But if you read, if you look at the Pali, it doesn't say that, it says all the terminations

10:26.000 --> 10:31.920
are impermanent, all the terminations are suffering, all things are not self.

10:31.920 --> 10:38.240
So that's what I was discussing just a few seconds ago, that difference in the simultaneous

10:38.240 --> 10:44.680
the present things on a different level, as in the present Dama, present self is determined

10:44.680 --> 10:52.480
by present things that are within it that cannot be the self at the same time.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.960
So go on now.

10:54.960 --> 11:08.080
In simpler terms, if a person can make a contemplation out of it, again, to do general things, things

11:08.080 --> 11:12.160
are mine because I am, but it's out of the way around.

11:12.160 --> 11:19.400
It's because you keep taking things to be for me, you keep assuming that you are.

11:19.400 --> 11:26.280
So appropriation of as mine comes first, structurally, not temporary, which means you can't have

11:26.280 --> 11:30.880
sense of self without a sense of ownership being present there, simultaneously with that

11:30.880 --> 11:35.040
sense of self.

11:35.040 --> 11:39.680
And that's why for somebody who has understood the Dama sort of on a higher, they have abandoned

11:39.680 --> 11:44.560
that Atavada, but they still have a degree of conceit, they would respond to a degree

11:44.560 --> 11:49.800
of appropriation that they still maintain in regard to things, but ultimately, of course,

11:49.800 --> 11:52.480
they're heading towards complete freedom from it.

11:52.480 --> 11:58.600
So in practical terms, if a person wants to contemplate, just take your body, for example,

11:58.600 --> 12:02.920
don't take some random objects because you might, well, it's a subtle thing to understand,

12:02.920 --> 12:07.080
so you want to try as accurate as possible, you want to start as accurate as possible,

12:07.080 --> 12:11.600
and the most accurate, the most factual thing that you have is your body.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.520
And that is something, your senses, that is something that everybody automatically appropriates

12:15.520 --> 12:18.800
in regards to his mind, and things that I am.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.280
Like I can see here taste touch because I am, it's actually out of the way around, it's

12:22.280 --> 12:26.400
because you keep seeing, hear me tasting, touching your song, you think you are, as in

12:26.400 --> 12:30.160
you think you are the owner of that.

12:30.160 --> 12:35.680
So if a person wants to undermine that sense, you can't just start explaining to yourself

12:35.680 --> 12:40.840
that this body is impermanent and use like medical jargon and so on, because it assumes

12:40.840 --> 12:45.440
this external point of view, no, you need to feel that impermanence right through the

12:45.440 --> 12:50.880
heart of that ownership, and how you do it, you do it by allowing the ownership to arise.

12:50.880 --> 12:55.080
This body right here, that's present right now, sitting on the chair, talking to you,

12:55.080 --> 12:56.520
answering your questions.

12:56.520 --> 13:01.080
Can I have this present body here answering questions, sitting on the chair in this forest?

13:01.080 --> 13:06.000
Can I do that without this simultaneous muscle inside of my chest, the heart beating and

13:06.000 --> 13:12.360
pumping blood, without oxygen being pumped around my body, would I be able to operate?

13:12.360 --> 13:16.440
Without my lungs being able to breathe air, would I be able to operate?

13:16.440 --> 13:21.640
I wouldn't, which means any sense of ownership, master intentionality that I might exhibit

13:21.640 --> 13:26.640
is directly determined, simultaneously determined, or rather determined by the simultaneous

13:26.640 --> 13:33.200
presence of these other functioning things that I cannot control, because you can't

13:33.200 --> 13:37.880
even conceive how it would be to tell your heart to stop, and it would be just completely

13:37.880 --> 13:38.880
involuntary.

13:38.880 --> 13:45.120
It's an involuntary muscle, which means it just works on its own, yet your whole life

13:45.120 --> 13:46.320
depends upon it.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.080
Now many people might think that, contemplate the heart and impermanence of it, but you

13:51.080 --> 13:56.200
don't want to contemplate it, as I said before, after or before, you want to contemplate it

13:56.200 --> 14:02.240
right through the present thing of this appropriation of this body.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.640
In another video I was talking about, like the simile, the simile of the chariot, how

14:05.640 --> 14:07.960
people say, it's made out of parts, that is not real.

14:07.960 --> 14:14.720
No, you want to see the parts through the existing phenomenon of the whole.

14:14.720 --> 14:20.280
So the contemplation of body parts will work only, as in it will result in dispassion and

14:20.280 --> 14:26.240
freedom from suffering, and this owning of your own body and your own sense of self,

14:26.240 --> 14:31.920
which means it will result in anata, contemplation of parts will result in that, if you see it

14:31.920 --> 14:37.160
within the presently arisen basis of this appropriated body.

14:37.160 --> 14:41.120
So this body that I am, this sentence that I'm talking, this situation that I'm in control

14:41.120 --> 14:47.960
of, can be undermined at any second by the beating heart if it stops to pump, that's

14:47.960 --> 14:48.960
it.

14:48.960 --> 14:57.600
I cannot continue existing if these parts that comprise this entire body, if these parts,

14:57.600 --> 15:04.280
if they stop functioning, if they are dismembered, if they fail, none of which you can control.

15:04.280 --> 15:10.480
So recognition of that, of those determinations of those parts, recognition of that, it's,

15:10.480 --> 15:11.920
they are basically impermanent.

15:11.920 --> 15:12.920
Why?

15:12.920 --> 15:16.720
Because you know, they might be working now, but they cannot possibly work like this in

15:16.720 --> 15:20.800
this particular arrangement forever, it's just inconceivable.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.840
So that's the first recognition of impermanence, which then in itself, well this, this cannot

15:24.840 --> 15:30.680
be pleasurable, because pleasant notion is the notion of eternity, it's going to be unchanged

15:30.680 --> 15:33.040
forever, stable.

15:33.040 --> 15:40.040
And if you experienced the heart of your ownership as impermanent and unpleasurable, you disown

15:40.040 --> 15:42.040
it automatically.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.360
That's also another thing I want to say.

15:43.360 --> 15:49.200
So a person who starts discerning Sabes, Sankara, Anicia, Sabes, Sankara, Dooka, they

15:49.200 --> 15:53.000
don't need to then go in our case, or Saba, Dama, Anata.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.880
No, their experience will automatically become Dama, Anata, Saba, Dama, Anata.

15:59.880 --> 16:04.120
It will be automatically experienced as not my self.

16:04.120 --> 16:09.640
This sense of self, this body, this situation, by being actually fundamentally rooted in

16:09.640 --> 16:15.560
that which is completely outside of my reach or control, undermines the ownership of this

16:15.560 --> 16:16.560
very situation.

16:16.560 --> 16:22.840
Thus, situation remains unchanged in a way, but then everything changes because the ownership

16:22.840 --> 16:23.840
of it has been removed.

16:23.840 --> 16:27.600
That's why Arahant cannot be necessarily recognized externally.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.880
He still acts, talks, and does stuff normally like everybody else does.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.280
But there is no ownership of any part of that.

16:34.280 --> 16:38.080
Thus, there is no any conceit or sense of self.

16:38.080 --> 16:45.520
So as a girl, as the example you gave of seeing your bodily situation that you find yourself

16:45.520 --> 16:52.240
in, determined by the presence of, let's say, the heart.

16:52.240 --> 16:58.120
What is the way to bring your mind to this without making the presence of your heart

16:58.120 --> 17:00.080
a B, as we said before?

17:00.080 --> 17:01.080
Yeah, exactly.

17:01.080 --> 17:05.760
Without overattending it, and then making a presence of your heart another thing that

17:05.760 --> 17:09.280
now you're not seeing that the relationship of the termination anymore.

17:09.280 --> 17:15.840
Well, the thing is, again, you must not become a mindful of how you feel in this present

17:15.840 --> 17:19.200
situation.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.160
So the present situation being felt, right here, right now, to this extent, pleasant

17:23.160 --> 17:31.600
and pleasant neutral, and then just start not allowing your mind to approach the notion

17:31.600 --> 17:37.680
of a pumping heart as a determination, not allow your mind to approach it as an afterthought

17:37.680 --> 17:44.640
or as before or as maybe as an explanation, but actually go through that situation that's

17:44.640 --> 17:47.000
being felt.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.840
And for most people, it's going to result in anxiety and concern, which is the inevitable

17:52.840 --> 17:53.840
beginning.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.560
That's why in the suit as you did when people came to the Buddha and they asked him, what

17:58.560 --> 17:59.560
is he teaching?

17:59.560 --> 18:03.440
He would explain the notself when they would fall on the ground beating their breast and

18:03.440 --> 18:05.920
pulling their hair in despair.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.360
That's because they generally understood what he was teaching.

18:09.360 --> 18:14.760
But obviously, they did not let go of the notion of self, hence they experienced terror

18:14.760 --> 18:18.640
and they started, they would shout or this will kill us, this will destroy us, this will

18:18.640 --> 18:22.440
obliterate us, because they did actually understand what he was referring to.

18:22.440 --> 18:28.200
So then they misunderstood something, you wouldn't be that afraid.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.160
That's why Sila needs to come first, mindfulness and restraining the danger in the slightest

18:32.160 --> 18:35.280
fault, because they will keep you together from falling onto the ground and beating your

18:35.280 --> 18:39.200
breast and becoming desperate.

18:39.200 --> 18:45.320
So is that that's in a matter of the only so much, far of determining that way to...

18:45.320 --> 18:48.840
Determining the presently, determining the present determination within the present there

18:48.840 --> 18:51.440
isn't a thing.

18:51.440 --> 18:56.400
So while the thing is present, you determine the determination within it.

18:56.400 --> 19:00.560
Not before or after.

19:00.560 --> 19:07.320
So while this body here, which is automatically taken is mine, without overthinking, without

19:07.320 --> 19:11.840
making a separate experience of a thought of my pumping heart, but stay with the thought

19:11.840 --> 19:17.400
of this present experience, peripherally, I discerned dependence that this experience

19:17.400 --> 19:22.160
has upon a random beating muscle of a heart, heart muscle, that's it.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.360
And then you'll feel it, you'll start feeling it.

19:25.360 --> 19:38.880
And when you start feeling it, you'll know you're doing it right.
