1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,920
So this is from the Angutra Nika and it's called Flies.

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,840
The Blessed One says, Bikku's this morning I dressed, took my bowl and robe and entered

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,640
Varanasi for alms, while walking for alms near the cattle-yoking fig tree, I saw a dissatisfied

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:46,800
Bikku seeking gratification outwardly, muddle-minded, confused, without clear comprehension, uncomposed

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,600
with a wandering mind and loose sense faculties.

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,680
Having seen him, I said to that Bikku, Bikku do not pollute yourself, it is inevitable

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:06,400
that flies will pursue an attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,160
Then being exhorted to thus, that Bikku acquired a sense of urgency.

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,120
When this was said, a certain Bikku asked the Blessed One, what Bante is meant by pollution,

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,880
what is the stench and what are the flies?

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,320
He says, longing is what is meant by pollution, polluting yourself.

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,480
Ill will is the stench, bad unwholesome thoughts of flies, it is inevitable that flies will

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:39,240
pursue an attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.

14
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,080
So you can have these unwholesome thoughts, these repetitive, evil thoughts of lust, of

15
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
ill will.

16
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
Why is that?

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,400
Why are these flies there?

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,680
So how do you deal with the flies?

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,480
You try to kill every fly individually, preventing the thoughts dealing with them, antidoting

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,800
them, managing them, removing them, or remove the reason why they are coming back.

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,080
Ill will, longing, lust, distraction, remove that, these thoughts will stop coming.

22
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
We keep saying that.

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,520
So that's how you abandon them.

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,960
You have flies abandon you by removing that which flies want.

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
The stench.

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,160
And you maintain the stench, you maintain the pollution by acting out, by not being restrained,

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,560
by not enduring things on the right level.

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,800
That's exactly how you maintain craving, and longing, and aversion towards pain, and wanting,

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,280
pleasure, all the reasons that these flies keep coming back.

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,960
So God just sends those, protect the context, don't act out, endure things on the right

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,760
level, and flies will stop coming.

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,480
And they can't come back?

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,600
If you lose your behavior, if you start acting, if you start basically accruing again the

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,840
stench, accumulating the stench, and the flies will come back, it's not something that can

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
be done accidentally.

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,360
Sure, it can be done carelessly, but because you kept choosing to act out, and go back

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,280
to desires, and lose your sensory strength, and abandon the context, and give into distraction,

38
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
and so on.

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,680
So then the flies will come back.

40
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
But if you're of the view that the flies are the problem, and you must be dealing with

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,480
the flies through concentrating, and this, and that, and method to stop thinking, and

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,960
all these practices, and whatever people would misunderstand from the suttas, then you're

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,080
still not emptying the rubbish, because of which the flies are coming, you're just chasing

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,580
the flies more vehemently.

45
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,360
You're putting up these barriers, external barriers, and nets, and borders, and machines,

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,440
and trash, and repellents, but fundamentally.

47
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,680
While the very problem is the thing that's putting up the borders, and the tractors.

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,560
Yeah, that's where the bad smell is.

49
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,920
So assuming you can spend a whole life of management, successful, to a degree, skilled,

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:16,400
with protected circumstances, and so on, fundamentally, you're still in the same domain.

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,680
So if you have thoughts of ill will, or thoughts of lust, and oh, I must get rid of this, this

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
is the problem.

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,320
No, that's the symptom of the problem.

54
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,520
Those thoughts are there because your mind has the sediment times, and in the suttas

55
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,120
as well, frequently ponders and dwells on things that are attracting lust, lustful

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,560
thoughts, and angry thoughts, and thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of distraction.

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,840
So don't frequently ponder on those themes.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
What themes?

59
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,600
Well, themes of pleasure is valuable, themes of a version of pain is justified, themes

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,680
of these things belong to me, and I feel entitled to act out, and be free from suffering, and

61
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,160
get this, and get my jaan, and get whatever else, I don't want to deal with this.

62
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,760
The themes of I, the themes of mine, all these themes that are contradictory to the universal

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,600
natural experience.

64
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:10,680
Those wrong views of the dirt, yeah, they're perpetuating your attitudes of dirt, the attitudes

65
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:20,200
of longing, the attitudes of aversion, wanting pleasure, aversion to pain, and as it comes

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,560
out of those fundamental cravings.

67
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:32,520
You can't start the cleansing if you have that wrong view that it is the world that

68
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
is making me.

69
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,040
It's the flies that make me think, yeah, yeah, no, that's not where the stench is, that's

70
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
the symptom of the stench.

71
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,440
If there are flies, it means there is something, and again, colloquially, flies keep coming

72
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,520
back, I better check this room, I better check this building, something they keep coming

73
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
back for.

74
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,200
But if you can't even admit that, then you don't have that mundane right view.

75
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,280
And you wouldn't admit that because it's just too much aversion towards flies.

76
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,560
Lastful thoughts, I must get rid of it, and I must get rid of it, I must get rid of it,

77
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,640
that's where the problem is.

78
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,200
And then the idea of what meditation is, it sort of follows out of that, okay, let me

79
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,000
just concentrate when I'm not aware of these things anymore, when I stop hearing the flies.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,080
That's how I'm free from it, you know, that's just how you learn how to concentrate and

81
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,640
look away from them.

82
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,880
So, you know, seeing where the stench is coming from, accepting that the flies are there because

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
of the stench.

84
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,840
Yeah, so not wasting, not perpetuating your views of trying to deal with the flies, but

85
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,040
actually focus of, okay, presence of flies means simultaneous presence of the that which

86
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
flies are attracted to.

87
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,800
So lastful thoughts cannot come, cannot exist, cannot assail me, I cannot be liable to them

88
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,640
unless there is a simultaneously present state of lastful mind.

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,280
Where is that lastful mind?

90
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,000
It's not on the level of the flies and thoughts, it's on the level of signs and features, as

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,520
we said before.

92
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,600
So how do I discern that?

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,960
What do I look for?

94
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,520
What do I need to do in that sense?

95
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,240
But yeah, if all you do is feel justified about dealing with the flies, through all sorts

96
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:18,640
of, you know, management techniques and concentrations and so on, then yeah, there's none of this

97
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,040
can apply to them.

98
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,880
But that seeing where the problem is, that's close to the right view, you know, that mundane,

99
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
so it's...

100
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Yeah, sure.

101
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
You know, it's almost...

102
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,240
Well, it's kind of necessary for the right view, because if you don't even see where

103
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,280
the problem is, you won't be able to learn how to endure things rightly.

104
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,760
For you, endurance would just be, okay, I just have to put up with these flies and do nothing.

105
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
No?

106
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,680
You still got to do something, but it mustn't be aimed at the flies.

107
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
But all I see is flies and doing something towards flies.

108
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,160
Well, exactly, so you need to learn how else to do something without doing what you take

109
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,640
for granted to be done, deal with the flies, deal with the things that bother me.

110
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
The middle way.

111
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Yeah.

112
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,480
But if you're not, if you're going to be trying to deal with things all the time, manage things

113
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:14,560
which are not the actual problem, as even if you're doing the Buddhist so-called, according

114
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
your techniques and your management of the Buddhists...

115
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,520
Sure, verbatim, whatever, do what the Sutta says, you're not doing it on the right level.

116
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,000
And then in a very dangerous situation as well, because now you're establishing that

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
for yourself as the way out of suffering, when in fact...

118
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Yeah.

119
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
It's not.

120
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
And then you feel even more justified in managing and dealing with the flies and preventing

121
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,840
flies from coming, not by removing the bait, but by setting up further traps and controlling

122
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,960
the environment and avoiding things that disturb you, like you saw.

123
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,200
So how does one get the right view?

124
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,560
By not dealing with the flies.

125
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,120
Taking this by reflecting on what...

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,640
Where the problem is.

127
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Where the problem is.

128
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,120
Although, you know, everything, all my senses are pointing me, it's because of this, this

129
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,520
is why I'm lost for it, this is why I'm angry, that's not what the Buddha said.

130
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,040
The root of suffering is craving, not the world, not things in the world, not sense

131
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,160
objects, not senses, not your thoughts, it's the craving in regard to what is felt.

132
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,040
So that's always on me.

133
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,560
And that's exactly why the right view starts with understanding what suffering is.

134
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,360
Presence of craving means presence of suffering, not presence of flies or presence of this

135
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
or that.

136
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,920
So what is that craving that I need to understand?

137
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:47,560
If you discern it, understand it, see its signs and features, that is the right view.

138
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,560
You saw the cause of suffering, truly, correctly, accurately.

139
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,720
Then you will know exactly what the escape from it is.

140
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,840
You wouldn't need to figure it out as a next step or something.

141
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,240
Seeing the presence of craving means, okay, so absence of craving means absence of suffering

142
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,240
regardless of the flies and the circumstances.

143
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,160
So what, how can I have that craving always absent?

144
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,680
And that's the noble aid for path.

145
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,960
You might not see it in eight terms, as the Buddha described it, but you would see exactly

146
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,920
what that path is in the broad strokes, sensory strength, guarding of the sense doors, not

147
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,200
acting out and doing things on the right level until this gratuitous aversion towards discomfort

148
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,880
is abandoned, which is craving, gratuitous aversion towards discomfort that you take

149
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,920
for granted is your craving.

150
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,000
Pleasure is delight towards comfort is your craving.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,640
That's how there's no, a thing, a craving that you can witness with your senses.

152
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,760
It's always the background context that's maintained through careless attitude of pleasure.

153
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm leaning towards just, just by default, no reason.

154
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:58,280
And the reason is you haven't considered well, thoroughly, frequently, often enough that

155
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
leaning towards pleasure is actually dangerous.

156
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,760
That's the danger.

157
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,880
Not presence or absence of pleasure in the world and everything in my cup.

158
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,040
No, it's leaning is the trap, accepting that attitude is how you get trapped, leaning away

159
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,760
from pain, just gratuitously, no, not wanting it.

160
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
It's like, why?

161
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, because you never really considered it thoroughly on that level.

162
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,440
That leaning towards, that's the longing.

163
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Leaning away, that's the aversion.

164
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
That's the stench.

165
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Yeah, that's the stench.

166
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,280
And then the suffering, the flies, flies, the flies.

167
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,640
That's all the consequences of it.

168
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,840
So if there is no leaning, there would be no flies.

169
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,000
If there is no leaning towards pleasure, there would be no lust or thoughts.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,200
If there is no leaning away from pain, i.e. aversion, craving, there would be no angry

171
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,280
thoughts, no thoughts available, no thoughts of discomfort or discontent.

172
00:11:53,280 --> 00:12:05,120
That's all the thoughts and hindrances and everything else are the symptoms of the problem,

173
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,200
problem of your craving.

174
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,800
So this is the verse at the end of that sutta, it says, the flies, thoughts based on lust

175
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:24,400
will run in pursuit of one unrestrained, in the sense faculties, unguarded.

176
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:31,800
A biker who is polluted, tainted by a stench, is far from nibbana and reaps only distress.

177
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,640
Whether in the village or the forest, the unwise, foolish person, not having gained

178
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,360
peace for himself, goes around followed by flies.

179
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,560
But those accomplished in virtuous behaviour, whose delight in wisdom and peace, whose delight

180
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,680
in wisdom and peace, those peaceful ones live happily having destroyed the flies, having

181
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:21,120
destroyed the flies, starved them away, they'll die away.
