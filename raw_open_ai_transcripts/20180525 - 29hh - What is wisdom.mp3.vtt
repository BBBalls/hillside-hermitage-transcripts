00:00.000 --> 00:20.080
If you could explain or describe discernment or wisdom, what is the discernment?

00:20.080 --> 00:27.400
Knowing the nature of things, knowing things in their nature, that's what wisdom is.

00:27.400 --> 00:33.280
So that doesn't mean knowing about things, or having all the information about the things,

00:33.280 --> 00:35.280
it's a different thing.

00:35.280 --> 00:40.400
Collecting information, or retaining information, that's on the level of intelligence, and

00:40.400 --> 00:47.480
that can help if you know where to look for the nature of a present experience, nature

00:47.480 --> 00:52.760
of feelings, nature of perception, nature of suffering, nature of things that matters.

00:52.760 --> 00:57.520
That's not necessarily determined by intelligence, but by wisdom and by effort put in their wisdom.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.200
You know, no one is born with wisdom.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.800
People are born with different intelligence.

01:02.800 --> 01:09.680
But wisdom is developed through effort, through strength, calming of your mind, giving

01:09.680 --> 01:15.800
into craving and desires, all of these are called in the soot as the weakness of wisdom,

01:15.800 --> 01:19.600
because they all go against it.

01:19.600 --> 01:27.840
So that's basically what discernment is knowing the nature of things, knowing the nature of things.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.160
What is nature?

01:30.160 --> 01:36.200
Well, the nature of things, different things, obviously, are different in the nature,

01:36.200 --> 01:43.480
but most universally they do all meeting or other share the same nature, which is what

01:43.480 --> 01:52.400
everybody was talking about, the nature of all the terminations is impermanence, the nature

01:52.400 --> 01:57.800
of all the terminations is suffering, and in the nature of all things, it's they cannot

01:57.800 --> 02:01.600
be owned, they cannot be owned, they don't belong to you.

02:01.600 --> 02:07.600
Therefore you can use them, but you're making a grave error in maintaining your assumption

02:07.600 --> 02:10.680
of ownership in regard to them.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.400
That's the root of all the problems as well.

02:14.400 --> 02:27.560
It's not the usage of things, it's the ownership that you maintain on the mental level.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.840
So that's the nature you want to be concerned about.

02:31.840 --> 02:35.800
As in, you know, you can investigate other natures or something, but that's all relative.

02:35.800 --> 02:40.160
You want to come to the root of the nature of all things, which is impermanence, and

02:40.160 --> 02:46.880
cannot be owned, because that's really all the matters.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.200
Why is that wisdom there?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.800
Because that's what wisdom is.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.960
You're starting that from the wrong end, that question.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.280
You would say, how would you call knowing the nature, and I would answer, how would call

02:58.280 --> 02:59.280
it, a wisdom?

02:59.280 --> 03:03.920
So you can call it whichever you want, but you start, why is that a wisdom, in plan,

03:03.920 --> 03:08.200
you already have the idea of what wisdom is, so why is that that wisdom?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.800
But it's other way around.

03:10.800 --> 03:15.720
You don't have to call it wisdom, call it any other word, but it will be called like that.

03:15.720 --> 03:16.720
Why?

03:16.720 --> 03:21.160
Because it takes you, it takes you, it takes you beyond things.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.680
Makes you make, yeah, literally it takes you beyond things.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.400
You're not affected by them.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.120
You cannot be accessed by them.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.120
Why?

03:28.120 --> 03:30.680
Because you remove your ownership.

03:30.680 --> 03:35.520
If you think they're not yours, you won't be emotionally affected by what happens to

03:35.520 --> 03:37.520
them.

03:37.520 --> 03:41.160
And that is wisdom, that's elevation of the mind, which means a greater perspective

03:41.160 --> 03:45.360
on things, greater perspective, because all the decisions people make in life, intelligent

03:45.360 --> 03:50.080
people, and non-intelligent people, are based on the degree, the height, so to speak, of

03:50.080 --> 03:54.360
their perspective, and the height of the perspective is what wisdom is.

03:54.360 --> 03:59.360
People with greater perspective, maybe not the ultimate perspective, but they are wiser

03:59.360 --> 04:00.360
people.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.320
They might not necessarily be ultimately wise and know the way out, but they're certainly

04:04.320 --> 04:08.080
wiser in relation to those who just have no perspective, who are just like animals following

04:08.080 --> 04:10.000
senses and sense desires.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.400
So I guess that's another way you can describe wisdom, it's the height of your perspective,

04:16.400 --> 04:17.400
universally speaking.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.400
So you can never be surprised.

04:20.400 --> 04:30.200
Absolutely, exactly, yeah, exactly, just lose something, yeah, and you cannot, the greater

04:30.200 --> 04:38.360
the wisdom is the less of an emotional involvement with things you have, which means the ultimate

04:38.360 --> 04:44.040
wisdom is complete surmounting of the feelings and suffering, because when you are a robot,

04:44.040 --> 05:01.200
it just means you're a very wise person.
