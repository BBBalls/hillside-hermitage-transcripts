1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,840
So, as one of you could say, a little bit about social compassionate, engaged acts as

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:23,600
a path to freedom, you know, to engage bullism as a very big thing nowadays, and that as

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,320
a path to freedom from suffering.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,680
Like, path got a hundred?

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:44,240
I mean, I guess depending on how you define engaged, to one extent, depending how you

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:53,000
define engaged, but what you said social engaged means like engaged with society, the social

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,840
work and stuff like that, no, it's impossible.

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,760
Basically, the maximum amount of engagement is what the Buddha prescribed for the monks,

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,840
in the part and giving the teachings to those who want to hear it.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
That's about it.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Even that, it's kind of on the margin.

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,280
So, yes, first, there's four laypeople engaging socially compassionate.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,840
Well, that's fine, but they cannot expect the results of our relationship, but as a

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,360
monk, devoting your time.

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,520
Well, it's a contradiction in terms that you'd be better off as a layperson devoting

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,880
a time to that, because there's a monk wearing the robe, keeping the vineyard, it's like

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,880
your statement that you're practicing towards the arrangement of supposedly.

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,080
So, if you dress as a monk, I mean, you are a monk, you keep the vineyard, but you act

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,480
like a layperson and social engaged, it's nice in lay terms and secular terms, and it's

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,160
very worldly, but there's nothing to do with practice of done, quite the opposite.

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,920
I mean, the Buddha was criticizing the monks who were quite detained at the time, like

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,000
Ananda and other teras, when they were sobbing the robes in that sutra, and they were just

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,160
talking around, like, you know, they had katina and sobbing the robes, and the Buddha came

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,520
in and was like, what was going on here?

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
When they said, oh, it's just Lord, you know, it's the katina with sobbing robes, like,

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
well, I thought he was like a band of fishermen, like shouting, like when they sell fish,

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,760
there's this ridiculous noise, and then he rebuked them all, and Ananda especially, you

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,800
should not be socializing in that manner, and those like monks with monks, for the, you

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,600
know, the great purpose of the katina, which is usually regarded as this great gathering,

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,040
yeah, the Buddha is just completely cutting down, because they were just, yeah, socializing

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:49,840
for no dharma purpose, basically, and you could see how much more that would be the truth

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,080
in case of, like, socializing for something completely secular.

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,120
It's nice, charity is nice, but it's no more than a good deed, so if a person is practicing

34
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,960
for art andmanship, he cannot afford, basically, to spend his time doing charity, unless he

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,720
can do charity completely in an undistracting manner or something, but it's highly unlikely,

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,360
and the best the person can really do is free themselves, that's how you contribute

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,760
to the well-being of the entire humanity, one being, one five aggregates less that is

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,480
trapped by samsara, there is no greater contribution to the big perspective of samsara, you can

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,760
be building hospitals and schools and everything else, and they will last, you know, maybe for

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,760
hundreds of years, but that's about it, but if a person frees themselves, they contribute

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:52,600
it to basically one entire being that's been tied for eons and eons and eons, they would

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,520
be freed from samsara never to return, there is no greater contribution towards the world

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:06,320
than that freedom of one by one, like, every person can help one being, let one being

44
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,440
be themselves, exactly, oh, well, that secondary, whether that being is yourself or not, but

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,720
yes, if you have to be yourself, exactly, you cannot do enlightenment for somebody else,

46
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,880
but when it comes to enlightenment, it ceases to be, when yourself, you remove the ownership,

47
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,320
which is why you become enlightened, that's the whole point, but from the ultimate point

48
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,200
of view of the, like, samsara and being strapped in it, that is the greatest contribution,

49
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,120
obviously, a person who cannot, people who cannot see beyond their sense of self and self

50
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,480
centeredness, they'll think, oh, that's your selfish, they're just doing that, but everything

51
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,720
you do, everything you have a desire to do, it's selfish, because you're just fulfilling

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,680
your desire, even if it's to help the others, so that's not optional, so you just want

53
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:55,120
to basically see how limited your goals will be or how expanded, you know, dedicating

54
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,800
your life to something that will make a difference in the world is very limited from the ultimate

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,880
point of view, it's certainly better than not doing anything at all, neither practicing

56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,600
for enlightenment nor being generous and doing charity, but the problem is when people

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,800
start to charity thinking that's what leads to enlightenment, well, that's not true,

58
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,680
so if you can do a charity that won't impede your way towards enlightenment, that's absolutely

59
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,360
fine, but as I say, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to do that, or you might have

60
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,200
to limit your activities towards charity and helping others, because they should not

61
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,440
be the priority of somebody, we supposedly dedicated their life towards the practice of

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,440
enlightenment, I, about this month.
