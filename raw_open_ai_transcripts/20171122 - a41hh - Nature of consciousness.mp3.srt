1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
One other point I wanted to clarify, did I read this already, but in the same way as

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:17,920
everything has to be a somehow or include within one or more of the Pantribudanakanda, that

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:27,120
in the same way every determination, Sankara must also be one or more of the Pantribudanakanda.

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,280
Obviously, to me that makes sense if everything is within the Pantribudanakanda,

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,960
the Terminations are within everything. That's the same thing when it said, I think

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,680
they thought it was certain, they said, well what are the Sankaras and it's just less

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:48,240
five aggregates again. So it's just things bound together. And because these things are bound

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,400
together, because intentions are bound with your reason for no one on a particular level,

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,160
it's just inseparable from. So that's what it is Sankara. So then when you intentionally

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,440
intend the given intentions, that's what your volition is. So that's why volition comes also

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,600
under the same sort of umbrella kind of nature of Sankara is bound with that.

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,120
That's whatever possibility is there. So the difference between an other hunt and

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,720
putugina in terms of these structural Sankaras and Sankaras in general, it's would be the directionality

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,880
of those Sankaras. For a putugina, they would be revolving around the center, which is his self

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,040
or his conceit, and they would be either directed towards or away or both or neither, but it

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
would have implication of that mind and their direction. For an other hunt, it just wouldn't.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
It would be things are significant, things are intentional. Volition would be just a result

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,480
preferent, we would be just a result of given choices, and fully less upon things,

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,920
than they're given by things. There's absolutely no interference of any conceit

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,480
or the idea of a center that owns the money, police, and churches, and masters.

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,520
There's a footnote to the passage, but I think it's pretty straightforward. It's basically just

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,320
explaining how Chaitanana are negative. It gives the example of a sheet of paper, which

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:24,400
at least in that utilitarian level makes sense. I like when he says like the positive things,

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,760
existence is asserted by the negative in the very act of denying it, just as atheism,

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
which exists as denial of theism, is evidence that the is an existence.

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,880
He takes that principle, takes that principle of assertion of the positive through the denial

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,400
that comes from the negative. After the very fundamental level, where a thing appears, that's it,

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
that's all. So you don't have to think about any further significance that is developed, just have

29
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:00,400
form is manifested. See, there is already that division, already that sort of denial of that form

30
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,920
by the consciousness, which is the whole result. The manifestation is the whole result of that

31
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,360
relationship of consciousness is not that form. Hence that form is able to appear as that form.

32
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,720
Obviously, form in itself does not need consciousness, but then we can't talk about appearance,

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,640
but the thing is we have the appearance. So from appearance, you can sort of reverse engineer

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,560
and realize the relationship that's necessary for that appearance to be, or have a direct insight

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,600
into it. That's what consciousness is to be understood, as the Buddha said. So that the very

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,840
principle, like atheism, the confirmed state is amazing. That's a very, very proliferated sort of

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,440
example of the same principle whereby just appearance already means denial of that which has appeared

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,440
to be the same as the point of view. Like sort of a separation. Yeah, I don't want to say,

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,200
oh, it's denial of it by consciousness because then consciousness becomes another thing that

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,240
denials everything because consciousness is defined by that which is not it. In the same sense,

41
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,120
that it is possible to be it because it's not that consciousness. That's why consciousness is

42
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,760
a fundamental negative, it's a fundamental samkara. And that's why consciousness, that's where

43
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,120
consciousness is rooted. Consciousness is that which points at the self through that basic most

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:30,960
fundamental division denial or creates creating of this appears this appears this which is different

45
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:39,520
from me basically. So it doesn't say consciousness doesn't say there is me but it kind of indicates it.

46
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, this is different then and then you fill the blank. Not me because I'm always here and all

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,960
these things are changing and appearing and disappearing but I stay the same. So it was then

48
00:04:50,960 --> 00:05:03,360
most of the mental kind of affirmation of the positive through its denial of its own identity

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,280
so to speak by the consciousness. The consciousness indicates that then there is something to which

50
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,240
all these things are being manifested. But it never fills it up, it never completes it, it never

51
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,400
produces itself because it can't. So you just eternal generates the power through the denying of

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,120
the actual thing that's appearing, that's manifesting. That's how generates the power of the indication

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,800
of that self. So that's why you go back to those things and the way they're determined

54
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,560
and then you see that oh, it is just an indication and it's such is positive in itself as well.

55
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,480
Not as positive as the thing that's being denied in its appearance but certainly positive because

56
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,840
you can think about it, you can discern it, you can recognize it and as such you drain the power

57
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:10,240
away from it. What is this? The indication here for me. Things appear for you. On top of that

58
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,360
the things appear for you, they can appear to be yours or this can be mine. Now this is mine.

59
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,680
And all of that, all that basic kind of very fundamental conceit is indicated by the consciousness

60
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,560
through that same principle of as he described it, the negative through this sort of denial

61
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,400
of the sameness, like, oh, I'm not that which appears for me. It starts indicating that you are

62
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,520
something else. I am not that which appears for me. Well, you don't even have to think that

63
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,400
explicitly. Obviously, I have to say it somehow, but it kind of would precede even the designation

64
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,640
of the words, but it is the mental attitude of when something has a reason, it's a separate thing.

65
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,880
Right, yeah, I can understand that I think a gross level of the whole like subject object dichotomy

66
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,800
that's natural attitude. It's just the thing is that the subject originates from that basic

67
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,400
kind of indication, just like a pointer that's created by consciousness by the denial of the

68
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,360
thing that you have conscious of. And there's just a natural experience, matter,

69
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:36,480
juxtapose to consciousness. The result is manifestation of the form. And the conceivings that

70
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,880
Malapariya also talks about, for example, didn't fall under that kind of subtle that the

71
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,240
directionality or just pointing. There wouldn't be the actual fully fledged development, but it's

72
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,880
because of that pointing that channeling, that kind of ushering, with ignorance, you just carry

73
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,120
on further, because obviously it's with the grain, it's with the direction that everything is made

74
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,600
out of, so there's absolutely no reason for you to start doubting that. Until much later, obviously,

75
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,680
when you're dissatisfied with the nature of existence, and I think Malapariya comes across the

76
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,080
dam, and he says, yeah, you go against that thing. Up to the point whereby in seeing there is only

77
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,600
the scene in her, up to the point when he manifested, there is only the manifested, there is no more

78
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:32,240
indicated assumption. Or other indication is, it perceives the assumption, is because it indicates

79
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,520
at something, you start assuming that something's there, and then obviously stop seeing the indication,

80
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:45,040
because assumption takes over. So it's a matter of someone being indicated, but it doesn't necessarily

81
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:54,400
mean that what is being indicated is necessarily, so to say, well, real. Well, it is real as an

82
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,760
indication, but that's the thing, if it's not known as such, there is already a degree of, well,

83
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,360
just by having lack of knowledge in regard to that indication, that's only takes, for that

84
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,120
indication, to be fully manufacturing a sense of self. And you feed that manufacturing, you feed that

85
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,480
result through not understanding it. That's all it takes, you don't need to make any other mistakes,

86
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,760
or do something wrong with our bullet. Just to not understanding it, you're actually feeding it.

87
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,600
And understanding, basically, this positive, negative relationship?

88
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,840
Yeah, at a very, very fundamental point of consciousness and matter, but it's the same,

89
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,920
the principle remains the same there, and it's the same principle that kind of grows,

90
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,240
further, and further, and further, and to all of the, to, like, even intentionality,

91
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,040
the usage of certain objects for various different things, those various different things,

92
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,600
are all product of that kind of secondary indication of you being conscious of that thing

93
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,440
at the fundamental level. So if you're conscious of the arisen object, arisen shape,

94
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,720
arisen need, intentionality will be there. So if I have a need to bang a hammer into the wall,

95
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,280
well, I would look for something they would fulfill that need in that sense.

96
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,040
And based on my experience, something sturdy, something that can take that nail into the wall,

97
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,840
it won't break under it, it won't get punctured, but if I can't find anything, I'll start kind

98
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,840
of going even wider, and then I might use the back of this metal cup, or I might find a stone,

99
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,280
not ideal, not perfectly tailored for that, but it's still there, and it can serve the purpose.

100
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:49,920
So all of that does not necessarily require a sense of self, but it's on the same level of that kind

101
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,720
of intentionality of things, the negative sort of thoughts in regard to things, the usage,

102
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,160
the possibility in regard to things, it's on the same level that there is also a particular intention

103
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:08,000
that it's for me, it involves me, it's apart from me, it's in me, it's outside me, it's in relation

104
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,040
to me, and that relation can be kind of, well, can go anyway. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it

105
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:26,720
implies you. So if you remove you, then yeah, you can still use an hammer, Arran can go and

106
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,640
go and bend the nails into the wall if he needs it, you won't be like puzzle, you know, like a

107
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,160
primate sort of picking up a tool and looking at it, like there's no one to do with it,

108
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,640
because he lost all the concepts now, doesn't work like that. All he has lost is the appropriation

109
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,720
of the experience as a whole, he has lost the conceit, he has lost that point in that

110
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,520
indication, that literature is indication of that center, independent of anything else, that sort

111
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,600
of centering it, because center cannot be known if there is nothing peripheral to it,

112
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,680
that just wouldn't be a center, yet center starts believing that it's independent of everything

113
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:09,120
and nothing, and all of it peripheral is nothing to do with me on the center, but how can you

114
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,240
have that center if there are no peripheral things? That's the same, like people think things

115
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,400
are mine because I am, but it's completely the other way around, you first assume the

116
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,960
use, that's how you generate the sense I am, and then on top of that you fully develop

117
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,800
view, I am, completely independent of everything, and then yeah, then you just start to property

118
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,920
more things and taking that as a, at a face value, as a complete kind of basis of your experience,

119
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,280
yeah, we talked about that before in terms of sense basis, how the mind is like central

120
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,520
in a way, and people take it all right, exactly, exactly, we kind of mirrors the similar

121
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,000
relationship, and then it's effortless to assume, to assume the same.

122
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,720
And in the last time we had that discussion about, well, it started with like talking about

123
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,800
atheism, by denying theism, asserts the existence of theism, and we got into that whole conversation

124
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,640
about that same kind, similar kind of relationship between negative, positive, conscious,

125
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:23,680
sense number, so on. And I just had a bunch of different thoughts that kind of came out from me,

126
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,480
thinking, trying to think about that some more, well at the same time, reading through the note on

127
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,880
the teacher some part, like carefully, slowly, and stuff like that, so I just wanted to share some

128
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:46,800
things from them by you asking questions about, much through that. So we basically, if I understood

129
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:57,680
correctly, asserted that basically this idea of a negative denying the positive is like a

130
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,480
necessary structural feature, like that's how things can be positively manifested at all,

131
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:13,840
there has to be that which is not manifested there too. Sometimes people might not be able to

132
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,280
understand that quite clearly because you kind of start with the negative possibilities of the

133
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,720
present thing, but even the present thing is what's real, the actual thing feels what's real,

134
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,960
and possibilities seems optional. But once you're looking at the nature of possibilities,

135
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,480
that kind of negative is like not this, then you realize that it extends all the way down to the

136
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,440
presence of that thing, which is what consciousness is, and then you realize, oh, this is actually

137
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,240
more fundamental than the actual thing, it's the manifold possibilities, it structurally precedes

138
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,760
the actual thing, the single thing is the present, but they actually precede it.

139
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,680
So that's basically where all these thoughts kind of start trying to understand how that

140
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:07,040
why there is absolutely necessary, and then further trying to understand, think about that

141
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,440
whole thing we talked about with indicating that is generated by this duality, so to say,

142
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:24,400
and there is a few things that came out of that. I kind of had this thought that when we have

143
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:32,160
this positive indication, like indicating this is for me that I am not that, which is for me,

144
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:41,360
there's this kind of assumption that myself is behind even what that is, that the negative being

145
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,280
indicated, like there's a negative, but then there's me behind that, like in terms of like a

146
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,080
directional kind of way, you know, is also thinking like sometimes, it feels as though

147
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:02,720
like self as a phenomenon can almost, you know, be positive and negative.

148
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,600
Yeah, exactly, that's what I think that's when we were sort of on one level, that's similar.

149
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,320
So it's the ultimate negative, but at the same time, it's the, it's kind of the center of your

150
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,520
universe, so it feels as a positive dimension, but if you were to look at it positively,

151
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,600
these are still separate fingers, it's nothing positive there, yet there is a very,

152
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,680
very strong positive sense of that, of that self, but there's a thing you said that for me,

153
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,480
it feels like it's even behind the negative, possibility there it is, that's how it feels,

154
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,560
in order to kind of bring it back in, and actually, the very thing you just said,

155
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,960
it feels behind, that's why the assumption of Atorada, that there is a,

156
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,760
this translated belief, belief in self, belief in self.

157
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,680
Yes, the common translation isn't it, yeah.

158
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,960
Well, that's where that belief, basically, it's found upon the assumption of

159
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,840
notion that yourself is completely external to your experience as a whole, that it's

160
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,320
an outside of it, and that stems from that very, more subtle assumption of for me also being

161
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,560
behind things that are for me, ultimately, even behind the negative possibilities that actually

162
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,040
determine as for me, but you end up assuming it that you are not within that picture,

163
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,040
that that for me is independent of it, which is why it's a particular, as it's peculiar nature,

164
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,720
which is why, obviously, the whole Patitamphabha exists with Patudjana, and then because of that,

165
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,360
on the subtle level for me notion, then when it comes down to the whole self, you that also assume

166
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,400
behind and everywhere below and above, basically, experiences as a whole,

167
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,480
I or Biggest Smoke can be self is outside of it, or it can be outside of it,

168
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,640
and that's, that's nothing other than Atorada.

169
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:08,240
So you would, you would kind of reel that back in, not by sort of, you can't sort of catch it,

170
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,720
because automatically, the way you look already implies that, so you look, carries the distortion,

171
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:22,160
so to speak, but then within that, you can, you can start looking as a, no matter what's behind,

172
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,160
no matter how ambiguous the background is, it's always going to share the nature of a negative,

173
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,960
which means no matter how far behind yourself is, and you don't doubt that it's behind,

174
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,560
you don't have to doubt that, or you have to know that behind still shares the, like,

175
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,400
the phenomenon of behind, still shares the same nature of the negative,

176
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
that we were talking about, so then you realize, well, it can be as behind as it wants to be,

177
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
it can never escape the nature of a negative, which means it's within the negative,

178
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,080
and that's how it's not assuming them, consequently, the existence of a self, independent of this

179
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,240
body and mind and so on, because it just, it becomes inconceivable. It seems to me kind of like

180
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,280
recognizing that for me is, in fact, an intention, kind of like any intention in a sense,

181
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,840
although a special character. You can't see it as, as an, as an actual sort of intention,

182
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,760
because it determines it involves you, but yeah, it is, it is like any other intention,

183
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,040
it's just the intention, the point set, the center. It seems also like so, as I was

184
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,760
assumed, it kind of bleeds in every other intention, like, I look at the cut, then I say,

185
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,840
that could be used for drinking for me, that could be thrown. You can say that that particular

186
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,560
intention ends up being superimposed over any other intention, or the entire plane of intentions here,

187
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,320
so that's exactly, it can appropriate anything. I was thinking also about that thing that

188
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:07,200
Nyanavira said, where the particular sins, things are mine, because I am, there it is, the

189
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:17,440
area sees properly, I am, because things are mine. We touched upon that briefly last time,

190
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:26,160
but I wanted to try and discuss it a little bit more at length. It's basically saying that

191
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:35,760
those positives, or somewhat positive indications are generated in this way, speaking, not like

192
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:45,040
emanating, but in terms of the structural feature of ignorance, by this denial by the negative

193
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:54,480
consciousness, and from then you take those indications, which are inter-overlaid over just the

194
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,680
normal of, you know, saying, oh, this is positive, this is negative, but then there's an assumption

195
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,960
superimposed, so say on them it says, oh, this indication of negative is the indication of

196
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:14,240
myself, which is the point of view. What I just spoke before this, basically because

197
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,000
there is that assumption of, for me, being behind, or independent of any other intention,

198
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,120
you end up assuming the fully-blown self-personality, complete independent of everything,

199
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:37,040
and the thing is, that is your starting point. You don't start with a corruption of consciousness,

200
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,240
and then the developing of the particular intention for me, that that's misunderstood,

201
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,680
the result in the sense of self. No, you start with the sense of self, so through the sense of self,

202
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,560
then you can start seeing these assumptions, mistaken notions. They're the real as such,

203
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:04,080
because ignorance doesn't have the manifested beginning whereby this is highly originated.

204
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,760
So although it's true, what you said, in one necessarily leads you to the required knowledge,

205
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,080
if it's not seen in the right order, and the right order is actually to start with a sense of self,

206
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,120
and then know that for as long as this sense of self, it's now present simultaneously exists,

207
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,720
means I'm taking things to be mine while this sense of self is present, it cannot be otherwise.

208
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:36,400
So you're not kind of reversing in the sense of an explanation, but more like,

209
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:44,160
that sense of self remains intact, but then your knowledge can go through it, while it's

210
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,160
still present, and then see that it actually requires things to be mine in order for, and then already

211
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,880
you stop regarding it as self, or certainly you regard it as less of a self, because now you

212
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,960
see what it's actually dependent upon something. It's not independent, extra temporal, changeless

213
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,520
self, as Daniel would call it. So then obviously the same discernment can go further than

214
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,000
you realize, well there is no mind, things don't arise beforehand on their own, so the four great

215
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,640
elements paid with consciousness, you know, their eyes unfold, they come and go, and that's it,

216
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,160
and you realize, and that's that whole thing, that whole movement, that whole phenomena is the

217
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,960
necessary prerequisite, the simultaneously present with for the appropriation of things,

218
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,840
for that notion of mind, which is then simultaneously present again. So you could say,

219
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,520
it's because of the appropriation of these things that arise randomly, there is self,

220
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,600
you don't have to necessarily talk about mind, but once you start looking at you realize,

221
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,240
yeah, it's a sort of a refined way of taking things to be self, you just regard it as mind,

222
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,920
but that's what precedes the sense of self. So it needs to be done in that order, and then

223
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,720
that which was taken to be itself, that which was the self, will become not the self,

224
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,120
but it might still be there, whatever that thing was, whatever that notion of self was,

225
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,400
whatever it was implied, stays, but ceases to be yours, because really you abandon the ownership,

226
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,080
only the ownership of that phenomena, you have not been negating or denying the whole phenomena,

227
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,280
or trying to reverse engineer or kind of re-explain it in more pleasing terms.

228
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,560
So it's true, because things are taken in mind, sense of self is this, but that can be seen

229
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:39,440
rightly, only through the existing sense of self. So basically, when let's say one is trying to do

230
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:47,200
mindful thinking, so to say, proper thinking, basically you're saying that one has to become,

231
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,200
let's say, reflexively aware of one's self first, within the situation, then everything starts

232
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,560
within the experiences of all exactly, and you can also, because sometimes, if mindfulness is not

233
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:06,880
developed properly, that sense of self remains kind of under a cloud, that sort of nature of an

234
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,520
extra temporal changeless, it's everywhere and nowhere, and you can't quite grasp it, who's

235
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,880
you're trying to grasp it, obviously, but if you're just mindful of the experiences of your situation,

236
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,520
and then no matter how big use that sense of self is, it can be designated as such. You

237
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,480
might not be able to grasp it as a fully actual thing, but you can certainly designate it as an

238
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:36,480
ambiguous sense, vague, vague remote sense of self, and that's enough, because if it was truly extra

239
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,440
temporal, change yourself, it exists outside of your experience, you could not conceive it,

240
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,960
you just could not talk about it, you couldn't think it, but the fact that you can do all those things

241
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,680
means no, it's very much within that experience, but then it presents itself as the owner who is

242
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:58,880
outside of it, and you believe that presentation, and that's a self-view, just the gratuitous belief

243
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,920
taking you in the face value of its presentation, I'm independent, but you are within the dependent

244
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,240
experience, so how can you be independent? And by not dwelling on that, how can you be independent

245
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,400
long enough, people end up assuming, or carrying on that assumption that there has been established,

246
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:24,480
just completely gratuitously, no reason for it, but the reason for it is not thinking about it

247
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,560
properly, enough ignorance, if you don't think about something after enough,

248
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,680
then you're ignoring it automatically, and that's why ignorance is the absolute first course.

249
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,080
I moved on from there kind of thinking about changing your movement,

250
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:52,560
I think most people assume that manifest things changing fine, whatever, but that, which is not

251
00:26:52,560 --> 00:27:00,000
appearing, they take, oh this is the same, that's experiencing each one, but it's that each

252
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,560
positive conditions, each negative. Yeah, of course, that even that, which appears as not changing,

253
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,840
in your experience, well can only be known as such in relation to that, which is changing, which

254
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,600
means it's not independent over it, which means then there might be something else in relation to

255
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,600
that, that's even less changing, so then from that point of view, that which was unchangeable

256
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,760
is actually changing, just a slower rate, it's changing slower than other fast things around you,

257
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:39,280
and that's just how things work, is just when that, when that sort of confuses people into believing

258
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,520
off, this is, this is permanent because it's not changing as much as other things, but whether

259
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,120
it's changing, whether at a higher speed or a lower, it's changing very slowly, changes them there.

260
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,680
Yeah, this paragraph, I'm not reading the whole thing, I'm just kind of paraphrasing the

261
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:04,480
best it just means trying to understand up to Vadupadhana, the idea that we were just speaking about,

262
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:13,760
okay, the positive seems to emanate from some source unseen, one one thing that was confusing me

263
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,720
as I was reading through the note, was he mentions at one suit to where he talks about consciousness as

264
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,920
he arrived, arrived at the emperor, arrived at the emperor, remember that one?

265
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:38,400
I get caught up when we start saying like consciousness is doing things, like arrived at or

266
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,840
growing or other such terms, like I don't quite understand what is meant by that, you know what I mean?

267
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,640
Yeah, okay, so you could say like this, don't think about it, it's doing itself, think about it,

268
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:03,280
it's happening to it, so, I mean you could say that plants are growing by themselves,

269
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,040
it can still endures the notion of art, it's doing it by itself, but it's basically,

270
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:22,480
yeah, you put a sort of a block of butter in the sun and it will melt, that's all to it,

271
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:30,080
so once the certain conditions come along, something will happen to it, so when the action

272
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:38,720
are rooted in wholesome, consciousness arrives at merit, the action arrives at the merit,

273
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:48,160
that's what ends up being for it, or happening to it, as a result of the conditions,

274
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,880
I guess say, cardinizes a meritorious, yeah, it arrives at it, but it's not doing it, that's the

275
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,160
thing, that's why like the consciousness grows because there are direction of growth that they're pulling

276
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,800
it towards it, and then it's just growing because there is an opening for it, if that's not there,

277
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:13,120
if that opening is understood, then you won't grow anymore, much in that sense, like it's happening

278
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,040
because the conditions are there in whatever is positive, so that's why like, I would say like

279
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:25,200
our consciousness is out there with the matter, doesn't mean it's out there next to it, literally, as matter,

280
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,480
yeah, but it means it's actually, it's nature is closer to that, which you think is the nature of

281
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,000
matter, then it's the nature of what you think yourself is, because consciousness is always

282
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,160
assumed as the most personal thing, as the center of experience, to the point that scientists

283
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,560
in what it comes to file in the center of your consciousness, and things like that,

284
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,360
while all of those sort of silly things basically are the result of the view of that self-centred view,

285
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,920
of self-consciousness being the very kind of root of it, but if you're thinking about consciousness

286
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,000
in the same independent manner as you're thinking about the four great elements,

287
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,040
then things will make more sense, so it's on the level of the four great elements,

288
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,120
and they're just a rise when there is a footing for them, consciousness grows when there is an

289
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,800
opening for it, and so on, and then your experience as a whole is just a result of that,

290
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,200
and that's why the whole appropriation of it is completely unnecessary, that's when you're

291
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,240
really referred to the regarding things in mind and the sense of self as a parasite upon the

292
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,600
upon the structure that does not require it at all, and there's actually no room for appropriation

293
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,280
at all, literally, it cannot be there, but not knowing that you put it there, that's why you

294
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,360
are responsible for its existence, that's responsible for anything that happens in a kind of that

295
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,760
fully assumed existence, but again, it's important to recognize that that's your starting point,

296
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,920
because if you don't recognize that as a starting point, then you will say,

297
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:00,240
oh, this is not real, the reality of things is really pure, the reality of things is nibbana,

298
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,000
and our ignorance is just delusion, which is not real, but it is, there would be true statement,

299
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,560
if there was the discernible beginning for ignorance, if there was a first point,

300
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,600
before which things are not ignorant, then developing the next thing, I can say,

301
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,080
but it's not, whenever you look, however you look, whatever you look, you're going to look

302
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,440
with your ignorance, which means that is your starting point, that mistake, but because it's

303
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
a mistake, because it's not supposed to be there, that's why our handship is possible,

304
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,000
so nibbana is present in everyone's experience as possibility, as a possibility,

305
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,400
but not as the ultimate reality, that you sort of achieve just by denying your mistake,

306
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,960
because you deny your mistake, and that's a mistake, through your ignorance.

307
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,720
So it's beginning one's start with one's end of self is, in a sense,

308
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,600
starting with one's ignorance, and again, it's not that you find the way out of ignorance left,

309
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,280
or right from ignorance, or a ball would be a lot of knowledge, it's right through,

310
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,960
while ignorance is still present, that a cognition of I am, sense of self, and then through that,

311
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:18,000
you can abandon it. One thing I was, I guess you say, excited about, and I'll set the right term,

312
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,200
as I could always kind of not quite understood what some culture of a Nyanam meant,

313
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,560
and I go like, oh yeah, because there's a termination, there's conscience,

314
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:39,760
and whatever, but I kind of had an idea that I think connected, something I wanted to read,

315
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:47,200
can I read the passage? Yeah, so I wrote a Nyanam being the fundamental termination,

316
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,160
and that things must be present before anything else. It depends on the fact that there is

317
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:04,560
determination at all, or the term I made was like determinationism, not like determination,

318
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,920
but like... How would you explain, or rather how would you describe, than the nature of determinationism?

319
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:16,320
How would you describe it? What's the most fundamental sort of nature of it? What's in common to

320
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:28,640
every determinationism? There must be two things. Exactly. So it cannot be by itself,

321
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,120
and if it cannot be one, just me, it cannot be self, because that's what the nature of self is.

322
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,240
So that's why it's because there are already two,

323
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:48,000
means that nature of the termination is there, because there has to be two things simultaneously

324
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,080
present, and consciousness being the most fundamental, one of them, means requires the other one,

325
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,800
which is matter. So because consciousness cannot stay standalone, that's why it's sort of subordinate

326
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,040
to the nature of the termination, the nature of having two things bound together, and now

327
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,440
know them can be the first. Hence, samkara parcevina, that's how consciousness originates as

328
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,720
defined consciousness, because it's not the other thing. That's basically the conclusion that I

329
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,200
got to, like the fact that there is determinationism, thinking where it just works for me,

330
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,400
is why consciousness can be at all. Exactly. Otherwise, it just would be...

331
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:40,080
Well, entirely incomprehensible. You could reflect on it if there's only one thing present,

332
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:46,800
there's no reference point for it. So that's why even the nature of the self,

333
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,200
it's hard, it's an absolute contradiction. There can't be one.

334
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,800
Here are the ones like perceptions of unity to say are what keep the self alive.

335
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,240
Yeah, it's that, and you can't possibly conceive unity without having diversity.

336
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,240
That's then united. But then your point of view cannot be united with it, because if you

337
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:18,000
were, you wouldn't be aware of it. So consciousness is that sort of nature, just presence of consciousness

338
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,560
and non-consciousness, the two simultaneous things, means there's always a point of view,

339
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,160
which means you cannot be that thing you're having of you all. So that's why even if it's

340
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,280
witnessed the unity, you're not part of it. So if you truly become part of unity,

341
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,000
means you become completely unaware, but then what kind of notion of unity is that?

342
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,000
So you realize any notions of unity that you can have in your imagination will be fully

343
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,520
based upon diversity. Some mistakes might say, pure unawareness is something to look for.

344
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,640
Yeah, but even that, they can develop that notion only based on diversity, which means

345
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,400
well, it can't be the pure unity, because it's diversified. So it's just, it's a complete

346
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,040
contradiction. They can never be sort of semantic like that.

347
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,520
So I was quite happy to start getting an inkling of what that actually referred.

348
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,880
Yeah, that was cool.

349
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,680
No, it's quite important, because most of people, no matter, you know, some people might

350
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,040
press it far enough in terms of a kind of detail understanding, something might not go into so much

351
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:32,320
detail, but there's a matter. The point is most of them would assume, all of them would really

352
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,320
assume consciousness in one form or the other as that kind of internal mind,

353
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,840
and often it's hard to sort of pin it down or understand it or clarify so that you can actually

354
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,920
see, ah, actually, no, even that when I am passing in careless thinking regard of my consciousness,

355
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,000
or this, or rather just consciousness order the implies mind for most of the people.

356
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,640
Well, if you were to clarify it enough, then you'd stop doing him and that, and that was in one

357
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,120
of the letters in early, early letters, and you know, he mentioned that, and he they're talking

358
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,840
about consciousness, and he was, he was often called in salutaries and so on, and then in one

359
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,440
of the letters, he kind of realized, oh, actually, no, I think, I think, I think I've been fully kind of,

360
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,520
just, I picked it up from such or something, but I was assuming that consciousness is always me

361
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,280
as opposed to, or here as opposed to over there, but consciousness is on the level of the, you know,

362
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,080
the five aggregates, so to speak. So basically, then he realized that, oh, well, if I'm correcting,

363
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:40,640
what I just wrote, that means I might have kind of abandoned the view of my consciousness being

364
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,600
myself, and if you, that's true, that's very welcome, and then the next letter followed another

365
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,280
inside, and another inside, and another inside, so that's how you build it up.

366
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,520
Like, you just started making sense to him, basically. It wasn't like, something he took on faith,

367
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,440
and repeated, and repeated. No, no, because I guess some people could perhaps just take

368
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,560
something on faith, but whether you take it on faith, or whether you can approach it with sort of

369
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,680
critical reflection and so on, you have to arrive at the same point, which is to understand it,

370
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,520
so often people would, too lazy, mentally, to make the effort to understand things, they say,

371
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,880
I'm not that type, I'm kind of the faith type from Sada, I follow Sada, I said, okay, so what do you do

372
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,920
then? Are you still making it to understand through your faith? And then you realize most of them don't.

373
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,080
So whether it's faith, whether it's its intellectual understanding, it needs to be,

374
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,280
needs to lead you to the understanding of nature of things, so for the Anavira he was not faith,

375
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,320
for sure, he was basically just trying to understand it. It's like an insight, he was after

376
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,040
insight upon insight upon insight, I think we're getting clearer. I think for those people,

377
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,880
too, they kind of mix up the fact that even someone who is the wisdom type has to have

378
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,520
faith still. Oh yeah, of course, he had faith, he wouldn't have spent years trying to understand

379
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,040
that, because he had faith that that was right, but he wasn't sure until he understood it.

380
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,880
The point is it's not like you suddenly get the knowledge of everything and all at the same time,

381
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:21,840
so it's a buildup sort of overcoming and sort of fading out that assumption, just sort of

382
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:27,280
destroying it bit by bit by bit, weakening it, and then things become clear. And then once it's

383
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,440
clear, you can't revert back why, because well, you will never suppose to have this assumption,

384
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,560
so to speak. Experience did not require him, experience did not induce the assumptions,

385
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,280
experience was not responsible for any assumption at all in any shape of form.

386
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,960
What was responsible is you not understanding experience. Now that you have understood the experience,

387
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,040
result of that is cessation of assumptions. And now that you have understood it, you cannot

388
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,240
un-understand it and then bring back the assumptions. So the point is,

389
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,680
in the year, if you did the suitors, you'll see whatever different approach you want to

390
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,840
mindy-taken, it all leads to understanding. Full understanding, I think that's what makes

391
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:19,760
a moment full understanding, not some perfect adherence to this method or to that method or to this

392
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,920
mantra, no, it's full understanding. And you understand things when you fully know them, really,

393
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,080
there's other word to describe it. And that's why, as I said, it cannot be reverted back.

394
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,800
Yeah, I have to even admit that up until fairly recently, there was this thing being

395
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,160
a sudden notion of what you described as ignorance, as a mystical entity, as opposed to an active

396
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,560
thing. Yeah, it's an active passive ignoring, ignoring, sorry, ignoring the thing, that's it.

397
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,120
As I just said, five minutes ago, yeah, because you don't look at it often enough,

398
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,360
that's automatically a form of ignoring you. And pair that with following distractions of the

399
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,280
senses, adhering to the view because of the blaze you and so on. So then you kind of reinforce

400
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,040
the act of not looking at those things. So then you reinforce your ignorance.

401
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,120
Yeah, no, that was, that was very important. Like, I remember him when I kind of realized that

402
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,880
because yeah, everybody starts with assumption of ignorance is kind of buried deep down inside

403
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,280
and they're all this kind of hardened shell of habits and whatnot. And then you need to kind of

404
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,760
unravel it all and reach the source and sort of pull it out. No, it's the most,

405
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,720
it's the thing on top of like on the very surface of everything what you do. It's right there and

406
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,400
you carry it through all your life times. But it's because it's so close to your eyes basically,

407
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,080
you don't see, because I just always look beyond it and other things. That's why distraction takes

408
00:42:52,080 --> 00:43:02,320
away from it. But when you look at it, it's really just a fully an active attitude. That's sort of

409
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,440
active in the sense you engage in it, but you can engage in it passively. There's literally

410
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:16,800
constitutes an active attitude. Exactly, that's what it maintains so easily. Yeah, flawless, flawless maintenance.

411
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:26,960
So using all these kinds of things you've been talking about, I think I understood more

412
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,400
one time, I think it may be like July, August, I brought you that suit there where it talks about

413
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,360
like feeling as a bubble, matter as a lump of foam, conscious magic show. So I went back to the

414
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:48,480
magic show one and I just wanted to share it with you, see what you think. In magic show,

415
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:56,080
always involves deception. A card trick, for example, relies on the viewer not seeing or being

416
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:03,280
ignorant of the hidden cards of the magician's sleep. The Buddha compares consciousness to a

417
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,160
magic show. The indication is generated by consciousness is denial and the positive,

418
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,640
but not understood, point to the self, so if we're imposed upon negative, rather than simply

419
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:23,600
pointing to a negative, necessary structural aspect, not seeing this and quote unquote,

420
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:30,000
elusions, realized such, of self as master, appears. This self can, in a sense,

421
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:39,200
and appear both positive and negatively, talked about that stuff. I can speak of myself as a

422
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,000
arisen phenomenon in some sense, but also is that behind the direction disclosed by consciousness.

423
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,120
Since this is all assumed as valid, self is then assumed to be independent of either

424
00:44:53,120 --> 00:45:02,960
positive or negative, since it is assumed to be, can be both, or the experience of the whole,

425
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,080
because one set out to see that, wherever self may seem to go, positive, negative,

426
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:15,120
determine each other. So whichever location one assumes becomes a little point because they're

427
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:21,520
all undermined. It's just interesting how this one thought, and then that sort of comes around,

428
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,080
and I'm like, oh, yeah, about that one, you kind of, this thing, kind of makes sense of the deception.

429
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:32,720
Yeah, that's what it is. The figure that deception equals a parasite, in a sense, so it's not

430
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,760
something to be there, and things that are being sort of hidden like that deception,

431
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,440
and nothing to do with deception, they don't care about deception. It's the viewer who's

432
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,080
deceived. Things remain uninfected by it. Cards don't care, where they use the

433
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,520
for deception or not. They remain indifferent to it. In the same sense, the organism,

434
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,640
so there's a parasitic, they're not aware, it just doesn't affect them, it affects the viewer.

435
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,400
But as I said, that's the starting point because there is no first moment when that parasite

436
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,680
or that deception began. So because that's the starting point, it is really such.

437
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,400
Although that being is fully kind of given to it through that assumption, through that mistake,

438
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,520
through that deception, through that parasite, it is given as such, and it is real as such.

439
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,200
So only through admitting that it's real, you can go through it, so to speak. And then again,

440
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,960
it won't become unreal. It will basically become not mine. And when it becomes not mine,

441
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,720
then the main fuel of deception ceases, and then it's not real in a sense, it's not there anymore.

442
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,200
But when it's there, it's real. And that's important thing to recognize, when people say things

443
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:56,720
are not real, when people say things are not real, they fail to see that that requires those things

444
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,200
to be present there, in order for them to be designated as unreal. Right, I wrote a little

445
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:07,360
version in the credit code. Yeah, sure, sure. No, I don't think you think that, but I'm just saying

446
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,240
you have to be careful because you can still fall into like subtler assumption. Sure.

447
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,320
Of unreal, it's not unreal. No, it's unreal, and it's real as unreal deception.

448
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,920
So the mirage, the magic trick, it's real as such, and that's important thing. That's why it's hard

449
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,760
actually, and it's a good example. The people misunderstand, they use the example just to justify

450
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,000
if it's unreal, but they fail to see that you're witnessing a magic trick, and it's really such.

451
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,080
You can't pin it down because you don't understand it, and that's why it's real as a trick.

452
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,680
Once you understand it, once you see what he done, he pulled the car out of his sleeve,

453
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,880
the whole thing is now revealed. It's still the same thing, same performance, same everything,

454
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,000
but it's not a trick anymore because it has been understood. So the being of it as a trick has

455
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,760
ceased because it's seen. But yeah, see, that's already slightly subtler way to kind of understand

456
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,240
it then to just say, it's not real, what's real, it's what's behind the trick or something like that,

457
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,680
and that's how people who dismiss the whole experience often.

458
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,040
Okay, I see what you're saying. The hidden reality.

459
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's basically the same reality. It's your attitude to change the world,

460
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,200
the reality remains unaffected. The magician still continues to perform in the same trick,

461
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,640
and deceiving probably the rest of the audience, but you've seen through it.

462
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,720
Same, you're witnessing the exactly same things that you've been witnessing before,

463
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,120
but now your mind is not deceived in regard to it. Yeah, nothing has really changed,

464
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,800
and that's somebody who's fully understood the consciousness. He's not deceived anymore

465
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,840
in regard to everything that has stayed the same, and that's why people can't tell the

466
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:23,680
part externally, because everything can stay the same.
