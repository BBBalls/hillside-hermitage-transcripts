1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, that's what I was going to ask, what do you think about the empires, the basis for

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
potency, the kitchen of your environment, as potency, people join their powers, or basis

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of spiritual powers?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's really concerned, well, it seems to be initially concerned with who's getting spiritual

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:43,000
powers. It's strange to me to be talking about that, but what it is is desire, energy,

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:59,000
tension is on, and amongst these four bases which have plus the determinations of striving,

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which is the four right efforts, and the composure days based on that will attain this composure

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
to that composure. You can build mastery of the body, you have these spiritual powers, you

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
can fly, whatever. And then it says, you know, it gets rid of all the tanks coming home.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you understand that, because you know, this is not an analysis, so these four bases of

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
potency may develop and cultivate and upgrade fruit benefits.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A big big advantage for basis for spiritual power, that's a basis for potency. It's

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
because there is a spiritual spiritual power, you know, that for this is composure due to

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
desire and determinations of striving. Thus my, many things, thus my desire will neither

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
be too slack nor too tense, and it will be neither constricted internally nor distracted

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
externally, nor dwells perceiving, after and before, as before, so after, as after, so

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
before, as below, so above, as above, so below, as day, as by day, so at night, so as night,

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
so by day. But as you can, as you can see from there, basically it's like the ultimate

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
clear perspective. That is, then the mind is composed upon.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, as you said, this is just one last thing, you know, many of the first cross ones

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that we said, that's because the mind is open and envelopes, the develops, the mind

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
gives them luminously. Right. That's it. So basically, I mean, the

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
approach that is dealing with others, but obviously the Iran is the same, the same thing

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
of, of like an establishment of mind on a certain clarity that depends on a certain

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
generality of that mindfulness in their level. Each, as if for some people establishing

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the mind in such manner would also result as other sort of say, if there is an opening

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
like in the service translation, what is often gained in these powers?

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Or hypotheses. But they are basically gained on the foundations of that clear

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
perspective that's actually the foundation of wisdom. So if somebody develops

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
wisdom in their right manner, plus has these openings, they'll get these special

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
powers. Or if somebody aims at a special powers through gaining wisdom, well,

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you'll have to go through developing that wisdom and knowledge based on the clear

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
perspective. And then the powers will be seconded, it really.

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This whole thing is about, no argument, just the keen earnestness,

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
earnest, putting forth an age you too, I understand.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, because you've got to go out the mind. Yeah, because you have one goal,

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
one thing going to the goal. And actually, people use this suit as this

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Buddhist teaching as a way to succeed in anything new.

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, right. It's right over there.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The power for base to success. Right.

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The beginning of what it is. Yeah, of course.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You need that same. Well, perspective and wisdom will help you with whatever

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
that. Obviously, it's not. It's not the end of it.

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because it's clearly talked about the terminations of striving in terms of

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
getting rid of an awesome quality for identity. With that,

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
you say, with that is coupled with that desire, coupled with that investigation

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
energy in the result. No, definitely.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The determination of striving was simply basically the energy.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's the main factor of very much among the main factors.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because it's at that constant, underlanting effort to the minds

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
putting in. That's basically how the world gets done.

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I think I told you that before, if there is a closest to a method of practicing

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the download, that would be the method of just not pressing

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
mentally as in possibly striving mentally to understand.

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Not striving blindly to some mechanical sort of repetition of some

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
motions, but striving mentally to clear out the mind from my

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
wholesome states, whether you're sitting, walking, standing or laying

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
down, whether you're going in the mud, tripping the leaves,

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
walking, because it basically, no matter what you're doing, externally,

60
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
internally, the mind maintains the same proportion, the same attitude,

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
which is not bothered at anything of wholesome, and understand the

62
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
wholesome, basically.

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Whereas the one who said, like the monk, like one, he's keen,

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
he doesn't leave anything out. He doesn't leave anything unturned.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So he does everything and investigates the meaning, everything until he gets

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
a clarity. Like the other source has dealt with a knife, like

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
cutting and getting in further and further and further, until things become

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
very, very clear. Or the other source, the butcher, skilled butcher,

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
cutting up a cow. And in the beginning, you just see this mountain

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
mass, sort of, of organs and stuff, but the skilled butcher is

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
capable of cutting it all out. And as he's cutting it bit by bit, he's

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
understanding what does phenomena. Now, that needs to be qualified.

73
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's understood in that mindful, phenomenological way, not in an

74
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
analytic way, as in you divide into 16 conformance and memorize them

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and suddenly think that's not understanding. That's just collecting

76
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
information. So in the proper sense, you basically keep pushing

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
things until the clarity is reached.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There's always having to go in mind.

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, there's one goal in mind, basically.

80
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Three of the top rankings.

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If he ain't known, it's going to be striving in this way

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
without the government. Well, of course, yeah.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So you have to understand what you have to get some degree of

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
understanding, as I said, so to say again, you hear the teaching and

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you measure the task, basically means you get the idea of what

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
needs to be done. And that's how you're around the energy

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
you're doing it. That's why people can't.

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They're very keen, very inspired, but they can't get the energy

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
because they don't really know what it's supposed to do.

90
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They're attracted from one meditation technique to the other,

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
from one teach to the other. But deep inside, they really don't know

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
for themselves what they're supposed to do.

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And for as long as that's the case, they won't have the energy

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
to do it.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, you have to have something.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's going to be broken, you know, all the time.

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The chanting is going to be.

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, can you show the ears, but you don't want to be defending

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
on that. You don't want to be defending on something

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
poking you. You want to be poking yourself.

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And basically getting the energy going in that manner.

102
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
As in, so like, taking up, becoming a monk.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
As in, well, sure. But no, I mean more particularly,

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
as in like, if you're sitting around, don't let your mind wander

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
thinking lazy thoughts, but pick up something you haven't understood,

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
something you think you're in this way, but just keep drilling.

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And then it'll pick itself up. The momentum will take over.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But not before you invest in that sort of whining up.

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're somebody who says, that's the urgency of ages.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I think it's going to make him do the methods.

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, I guess so.

112
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, because it seems, because you can become complacent here

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
with, like, the government asked him,

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and he said, okay, I'm not happy with being a good enough monk.

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah.

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's so easy, he's the guest.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He's used to live a lot to do something.

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're not exposed to anything.

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, I mean, yeah, but that is just like,

120
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
that's your undoing.

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Basically, because no matter how comfortable or agreeable

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
circumstances are, the fact is what you're still subject to death,

123
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
illness, dissolution, and everything else.

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So you just have to be thinking about those things,

125
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and you will be coming out complacency soon enough.

126
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But it's that lazy attitude, mental laziness, indulgence,

127
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
complacency that prevents you or other takes away from thinking

128
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
those thoughts, and then you don't even.

129
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And the further away you go, the harder it becomes to think those thoughts,

130
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
because then you have to make more effort to think that.

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If I may, this segue is nicely into one of my questions.

132
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This could dimensions.

133
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was ethereal being too strained versus too lax.

134
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The other sit, I always remember about it,

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is like the one we're in, but it's talking to some musician.

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He said, as you can, there are strings too tight for the loose.

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So I guess the question is, like, if you can just speak more about,

139
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
maybe, practical, so to say, you know,

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
finding the middle between, like, you know,

141
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
putting forth so much energy that it becomes, like, restless,

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and kind of, like, a little nutty versus, like, saying,

143
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
oh, you know, as you say, often you have to keep drilling,

144
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and then you can fall into the blaze, like, oh, you know,

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you just have to kind of wait around for it,

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
which is falling into that complacent.

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, the thing is, yeah, especially in the beginning,

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
you might be getting restless and so on,

149
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
but even nutty, but it's not only the world,

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
even if you do, as long as you're starting

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and doing it for the right reasons,

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and along with our lines, as in,

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
you're really trying to understand the sort of,

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
in that case, sort of picking up some metals

155
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and becoming a robot or something,

156
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and then get completely obsessed with that.

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So it has to be, that's what I say,

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
so the method, so you can't just keep repeating it,

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
you can't do it the same every day,

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
because different things arise in your experience,

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
which means you need to look at them differently,

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you need to, so that, which is in common to your efforts,

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
is that desire to understand,

164
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
desire to reach a clarity of the phenomena,

165
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
or the feeling, intention, perception,

166
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
basically suffering, freedom from it,

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the form of the truth, whatever you want to call it.

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's the same insight, so,

169
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
if you're doing it rightly,

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you would see that basically,

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
you can't do too much of it,

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
as in, you might get tired,

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
so you can't keep actively making effort to understand,

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but the state of not making the effort mentally,

175
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
does not need to lead to the state of being

176
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
relaxed and complacent either.

177
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So yeah, you don't have to be actively pursuing,

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but you can remain mindful,

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and you can't have too much of that mindfulness.

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's basically the other,

181
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
it's when people don't see everyone, that's the problem,

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
it's not that they make too much effort,

183
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it's when they stop making the effort,

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
they don't stay on that mindfulness, which is neutral,

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
then they go completely the opposite way.

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, I made the effort, now I get too relaxed,

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
because of the effort they made.

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So, you need to find,

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you need to learn how to,

190
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
how to rest,

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
because it is a restful place in that mindfulness,

192
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
not in the distraction,

193
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
not in the senses,

194
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
not in the sensuality,

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
which is usually what people use

196
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
for the restful place of their mind.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, I've been working hard,

198
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
now I'm gonna put my feet up,

199
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and really, you know,

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
have a drink and just relax,

201
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
or go out with a friend,

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
or do something,

203
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and that's what it relaxes people,

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the sensuality,

205
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
but actually that's not relaxing at all.

206
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But, for the mind who has that

207
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
as a starting point,

208
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
it will take some effort

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
into relearning what's true,

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
a relaxation is which is basically mindfulness,

211
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
the practice of mindfulness,

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
which is nothing other than samadhi.

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So, when you're not actually pursuing

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the understanding of the meaning,

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
but you remain on that basis

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
upon which the understanding of the meaning occurs.

217
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So, that's why even if you're not actually pursuing it,

218
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
the development of that basis,

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
so that samadhi,

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
will bring the clarity eventually,

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and a slow rate of still.

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, the composure, yes.

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Good, but the rest in touch are mindfulness screening.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, exactly.

225
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Because that's the thing,

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
like, it can make too much effort,

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
too little effort, doesn't matter.

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There will vary on your end of the day

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
what you have to do,

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
but there is no excuse for being mindful.

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Actually, there is no excuse for that.

232
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So, there is no excuse

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
for allowing your mind to rest

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
on unholesome things,

235
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
because not resting on unholesome things,

236
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
it's not actually touched them at all.

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But it states that it's the assumption of sensuality

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
that it requires us to,

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
well, that sort of makes us,

240
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
or maintains the belief that,

241
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
resting means when you get the pleasure

242
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
of the senses or distraction.

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But it's not.

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But that they stand to unlearn.

245
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
To relate it to a summary,

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you've used this word with, like,

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you know, when you're mindful,

248
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and there's nothing particularly on the whole sum,

249
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
it's like watching cows in a field,

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
like a chase absolutely,

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to see if they're there, just doing their thing.

252
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But people perhaps say,

253
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know if I don't look at the cows at all,

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and they're off my mind,

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
they don't have to worry,

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
but then anything can happen.

257
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, exactly.

258
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So, you don't want to be

260
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
counting and strangling a cow

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
in terms of trying to control it,

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
nor do you want to be looking completely elsewhere

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
where you don't even see a cow.

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So then that's the whole point of mindfulness,

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
giving that perspective

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
where you can see it,

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
without actually having to chase it,

268
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
or hold it down.

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And yeah, no matter how tired you are,

270
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
physically or mentally,

271
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
mindfulness is never cause of that tiredness,

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
nor can I be an impediment to rest.

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You could basically say,

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you remind a lot of I'm tired.

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Absolutely.

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And that's already quite a wholesome way

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
of resting.

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So if you're established

279
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
of a mindfulness correctly,

280
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you can never kind of veer off too much

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
of the right track.

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can't forget.

283
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, you can't.

284
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You can't get too warmed up

285
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and restless,

286
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
nor can you get too careless in central.

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is,

288
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
when you've got this,

289
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
there's already

290
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
any explanation,

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and how big is does it be cool,

292
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
as well,

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
receiving after and before,

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
before and after,

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
as not as after and before?

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah, because the perception

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
of after and before is well brought

298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
by a big alternative,

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
well considered,

300
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
penetrating by wisdom.

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Just in that one.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And that's it.

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay.

304
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So?

305
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Before and after.

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What?

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well,

308
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
do you have anything specifically

309
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
before and after?

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Who told you some sound?

311
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, no, no.

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Did you do that?

313
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No, no.

314
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Just before a phenomenon

315
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
before and after.

316
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Before this and after this,

317
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
past and future,

318
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
up and down,

319
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
above or below.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Basically, the point is

321
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
getting the perspective

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and your experience as a whole.

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Now, just what's here now,

324
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and what has been,

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
if you think about past,

326
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
what will be,

327
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
if you think about the future,

328
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
that's all already present

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
in the present.

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So, as before,

331
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
after this is what he clearly understood,

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
as after so and before.

333
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

334
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And that's where he goes to be

335
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
thinking about contemplating,

336
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
because if you're looking

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
to clear the self-management,

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
please,

339
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
you see what has happened

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
before.

341
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And you can see the possibilities.

342
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, I'm just sure,

343
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
but it's not the particular,

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
you don't pick up particular things

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
of your past,

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and then you think about it

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and learn from it,

348
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and introduce some sort of information

349
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
that can help you.

350
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And yet, that's fine.

351
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But this refers to

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
the actual framework

353
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
called before,

354
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
a framework of after.

355
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
On a very general level

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
of that perspective,

357
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that's why it's listed there

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
with those things.

359
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Not like with things

360
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
just remember what you've done,

361
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
remember what you might do.

362
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

363
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Before and after.

364
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
For as long as there is now,

365
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
there will be before.

366
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So as long as there is now,

367
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
there will be after.

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's not like

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that they're all free

370
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
at the same time.

371
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not like before,

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
now and after.

373
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why is this coming?

374
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why is it?

375
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well,

376
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
because all the assumptions

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
they are assumed in the past,

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
because all the other habits,

379
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
they're not existing

380
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
for the future,

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
they're presently present.

382
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's why.

383
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Because they're like,

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
when other hand becomes

385
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
another hand,

386
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
even when he thinks of himself,

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
at the time he was put to dinner,

388
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
even that,

389
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
he's not his self anymore.

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He doesn't even take

391
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
the past self as his self.

392
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Why?

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Because he has presently understood

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the nature of self

395
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
as truly not self.

396
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay.

397
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So he's taking this phenomenon

398
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and living in it.

399
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

400
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So anything before,

401
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
anything before,

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
just a framework of before.

403
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So a framework of after.

404
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There's after,

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
so before,

406
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
basically,

407
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
you apply that perspective,

408
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
that perspective,

409
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
that perspective,

410
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
in all directions,

411
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
so to speak.

412
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Now just right here,

413
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm not what I'm seeing,

414
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
what I'm hearing,

415
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
what I'm mindful of,

416
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
but any thoughts of past,

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
any thoughts of the future,

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
everything becomes included

419
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
in that perspective.

420
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Clearly.

421
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No, okay.

422
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Could you have,

423
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
obviously,

424
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
have that thought of yourself?

425
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You will.

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They always,

427
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
always,

428
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
always in the future.

429
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

430
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Every point of view,

431
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
as Annabella said,

432
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
has, like,

433
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
either under-determined

434
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
or over-determined

435
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
aspect to it,

436
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
which means,

437
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
depending on how you're looking,

438
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you're only looking to,

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
like,

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
either seeing your past

441
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
represent,

442
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
or you're looking

443
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
in the future through your present.

444
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And that's all present.

445
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Doing something now,

446
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
with this,

447
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
future in mind.

448
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah.

449
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah.

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Or you have some thoughts

451
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
with you now,

452
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
which, basically,

453
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
are kind of lingering

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
from something

455
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
there was before.

456
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That is also present,

457
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
as before,

458
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
now.

459
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And explain to the other,

460
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
think,

461
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
PROJECCDULORN

462
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
as a big draw,

463
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
as below,

464
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
is a little further about the

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,000
figure that is completely

466
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:43,000
your experience of the body depends. So you can take one part, you'll have to take 32, but if you would take all the parts that were there that can be taken, you'll have 32.

467
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So the body is the body as a whole, the experience of the body as a whole. You don't leave anything out or down left or right.

468
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You don't leave anything out to bring out that body, everything is dependent upon that body, which is included by including that body.

469
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So it dwells, it dwells. Yeah, it dwells not resting upon anything, not picking up anything, not assuming anything, not taking up anything.

470
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Interns spatially, and in terms of temporally, before or after, tens of time, and in terms of space above or below in regard to this, before or after in regard to this.

471
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So the same thing really just pertains to two different phenomena, but the same as it should. Not as it can be this one.

472
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:43,000
As it by day is so at night, so it's night so by day, it develops the basis forms, you know, the prosceness is composure due to desire and termination of striving, by way of the same qualities, the same features, the same as this, as it develops that basis form.

473
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You can see by day, it does not exist. Yeah, no difference. It doesn't really strive.

474
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And then, with the mind, it's open and uninvolved. Developed the mind and used the monocity. Here we use the perception of light as well, to ask.

475
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Luminosity, which basically should be to say there's a non-indicative. I, not pointing at anything, not resting at anything, luminous all around.

476
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It means basically not picking up anything in any direction. So I'm going back to it. I'm just saying that you can't use the word luminous, but you have to determine what it is, in what sense it's luminous.

477
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's in a sense, it's a non-indicative thing. Because if you're just to be luminous all around, you think of consciousness being this bright light that shines, and that you're entering this extra plane of permanent light and beauty, or something like that is up.

478
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It really doesn't indicate anything anywhere, before or after, up or down, as a resting point, as a sense of self, as something you will lean on.

479
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hence that infinity of that structure shines everywhere and nowhere, so to speak.

480
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So here we use the perception of light as well, across the perception of days, while we're solved.

481
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So it is in this way, because it's bigger with the mind, it's open, and it's empty, mind can use it.

482
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Correct, I get that. Do you know the phenomenon of light?

483
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Well, the phenomenon of light is negative in regards to everything that you see, when the light is present. You can't see anything, there's no light.

484
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But what you're seeing is not light, it's the objects, or in more particular things revealed by their light.

485
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So again, it's the same principle of a more general phenomenon upon which you start to remind, because of which you then transcend the particular phenomenon that depends directly upon it.

486
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Everything you see depends upon light being there.

487
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You know darkness.

488
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well, in a sense, yeah, the absence of light.

489
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So you resolve upon perception of day, or perception of light, and then your mind can develop, get established upon that perception.

490
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And at the standard for you provide you basically freedom from the pool of any particular things that you'd be seeing.

491
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So you're viewing these thoughts, particular parts, and present thoughts.

492
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You're reviewing them presently.

493
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You're going to end the body, but you're striving.

494
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Any night. The same.

495
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah, just maintaining the same attitude, regardless of what you're doing, obviously depending on what you're doing means you will have more.

496
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You will be able to invest more or less effort in it.

497
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But even if you're doing something that requires most of all of your attention, in that sense, you still want to compromise the mindfulness.

498
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And restraint, which is really kind of luminosity.

499
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, yeah, like on the basis of that mindfulness, your mind can get established upon luminosity.

500
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But upon all sorts of other different establishments, they will kind of provide you with the same results.

501
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Three of the only studies is just for different people, we work differently.

502
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I, different people can establish upon different things more successfully.

503
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But it's the same principle of the same establishment.

504
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's the same as seen as in some.

505
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The other says it's all the different meditations.

506
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It might just be breathing.

507
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
The different things is, I would say, different exercises in regards to the same principle.

508
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh, absolutely.

509
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And also, it's not like, for example, as it says, like the casinos, the ten casinos for example.

510
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's not like ten casinos.

511
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
One establishment of mind upon the casino, or one casino for all the establishments.

512
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But then within that, you can take that same establishment, same principle, further and further and further.

513
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Ten times, like the ten refinements to the same principle, so they're ten casinos.

514
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's not like they're laid out one, so you go from one, then you do the next one, then you do.

515
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
No, it's basically doing the same further and further and further.

516
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We'll take you from the casino verse to the most refined casino consciousness.

517
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But it's the same principle, which means you don't need all ten.

518
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You just need one.

519
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And you'll have all ten in a way.

520
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And the same, same.

521
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
For every genre is the same.

522
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Whenever in the suit, there's always a beyond this.

523
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's like developing the same.

524
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
How far you can go.

525
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So the practice of genres, the casinos, the establishment of different perceptions.

526
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's always the same principle.

527
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Now, principle.

528
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's a principle.

529
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's alternate.

530
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Well, yeah.

531
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah, I mean, you can.

532
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The principle is where the principle could be some further.

533
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Better.
