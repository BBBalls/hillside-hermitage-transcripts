1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So how was it going? Did you start?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah, actually, actually hosting I want to know is actually many monks, they asked me

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
what's the problem about the understanding of dependent origination.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Actually, I asked a winner where I find you at least it's not necessary for me to know.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He thought that maybe I would get confused, but actually simply I don't understand what they're talking about.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I started only the teaching of the non-zero whoever, the timeless creation.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But I think in Zealand most monks, they don't understand that.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
They think like a dependent origination process.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And that like two lines, three lines, I don't know.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But what they're talking about, I don't understand.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So it's very difficult for me to explain what the winner and winner thought.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So how do you explain to them?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, I don't think you have to start with a premise that they already have a different view.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't want to say never wrong view.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But yeah, from a real point of view, that's a wrong view.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wrong view.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because they approach a Patitsamapada as an explanation.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I remember Bikubodi.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He was very, very much sharing the traditional view.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And he would write about it and so on.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And he would say that no, this is not the core of the Dharma.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is more like an encompassing explanation of the entire teaching and the purpose of it.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So in a way, when you look at it, it's not wrong.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Because any aspect of the Dharma contains the entire Dharma.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So you can say in relation to anything that it encompasses the entire Dharma.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Because it can't be enough for somebody to become an Arahant.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
However, the Buddha himself said,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Dhamma is Patitsamapada.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Patitsamapada is the Dhamma.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Which means, oh no, it's actually quieter.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And then the Buddha also referred to Patitsamapada as the reason.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Not knowing that is why people remain bound to some sort.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So it's actually not an explanation of some ideal and overview.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a very direct insight.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And the fact is that every Patitsamapada formulation in the sutras

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
starts first by saying, with this, this is, or with the rising of this, this arises.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And that's already a calica.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So with the presence of this, this is present.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It doesn't say, as in the video pointed out, if you adopt a three-life interpretation,

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
it will be with the rising of this and then ceasing, then this arises,

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
then it ceases, then something else arises, then it ceases, then something like that.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But it doesn't say that.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It says, with the rising of this, this is.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So the determination, the reason, the cause, is present simultaneously with that,

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
which is being determined.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then the Buddha would say himself, with the rising of what, this is,

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and then he would formulate Patitsamapada.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And Bikobody was aware of that.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Because, you know, his palace is very good.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But he will refuse to give up his view of three-life interpretation.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So then he would dismiss this opening statement with this, this is,

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and say, ah, this is just an abstract principle.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But actually, even an abstract principle is still a principle.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So whether it's an abstract or not, it's irrelevant.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But by saying abstract, you dismiss it.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But the fact is, it's a principle within which the whole Dharma is contained.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So if you dismiss that, and then your interpretation of that Patitsamapada

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
goes against the principle, means that's a contradiction.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And that's why it's wrong.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So he always, oh, just, ah, this is just an abstract principle.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then puts it aside by labeling it such.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And then goes on into expounding how the feeling, connection,

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and this, I even forgot what the traditional interpretation was.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But yeah, then you had other people say, well, it doesn't pretend.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think that was K Nyananda Tehra, I think.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He was saying, doesn't pretend to the three-life, it pretends to one life.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But again, he took it as an explanation,

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
like as a kind of explaining what's happening.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's not the Dharma.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you're explaining what's happening, then it loses the aspect of open Ico,

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
leading on, that the Buddha talked about.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because if I provide your explanation, you can say, oh, yes,

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
or you can say, oh, no.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But that's it, it stopped there.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Because it just remains in the level of intellect and the view.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But if the Buddha describes something that in order for you to understand,

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
it leads you on to more understanding.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That means, ah, that has the nature of the Dharma.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So you have to bear that in mind when you try to explain to somebody

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
who already has a different view.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There are very little chances of them understanding it.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Because it is possible for them to understand,

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but it has to come from them.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In other words, they first have to see that they're wrong

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and then have to start looking out for what is less wrong

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
in terms of their current view.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And then they might be receiving to hear it.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But if you're just trying to convince somebody otherwise,

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it's useless. It won't work.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When I'm working on you, is it, ah, after if we try to understand

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the teaching of Venomanyana Bhira,

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
a timeless relation, and then the past and the future,

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
both are not important, is it?

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is it correct?

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is it a traditional interpretation program

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that passed on the future?

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, is it which means, oh, yeah.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, that's it.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, whether it's your past, whether it's your future,

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
it's present as such.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ah, past is present, future is present,

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and the present is present,

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
which is the nature of humanism.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's immediacy and reflection.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's two modes of existence, so to speak.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So when you think about your past,

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you think it in your present.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When you think about your present, you think it in your present.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
When you think about your future, you think it in the present.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So if you abandon that present,

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
in terms of you and this full understanding,

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
then neither your past nor future,

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
nor that which is right in front of you,

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
can pertain to you anymore.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So in that sense, yeah, absolutely.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's not important anymore.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Like, because if the past would be important

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
for the practice of the Dharma,

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
well, you couldn't practice the Dharma,

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
because you can't change what has happened.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If the future would be important,

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
in terms of how you just have to wait

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and it will happen by itself,

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
well, then again, well, you just,

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you can never know that directly for yourself.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can just take it and faith and believe,

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
which is actually what most religions rely on.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Just these belief that eventually,

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
it will all work out fine for me.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But like, well, okay, good luck then.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But what makes you think so?

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So even if, well, in the cases of people

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
who had horrible past, like Angulimala or other,

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
if they can overturn that,

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and escape that sort of past,

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but he couldn't, certainly,

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
he couldn't undo what he'd done.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And he'd done some serious things.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So you realize, it's in the present,

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
which is what I would have said.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's here and now, visible, here and now.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You don't have to wait for it,

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and you don't have to remember it.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's here and now.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And in the same sense,

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
he called it up and I call it timeless,

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
not pertaining to time.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And that's exactly how it doesn't pertain.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If it was pertaining to time,

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
it would pertain to past.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It would require future.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But it doesn't.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's timeless, which means all.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Because if past is present,

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
that's it.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
One thing is present, like,

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
output it.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Past is in present.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So that's a timeless relationship.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Present is in the present.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's another timeless relationship.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Future is as future in the present.

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's another timeless relationship.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
When you look at it from the point of view of present,

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
even if it's present which you're looking at,

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
that's a timeless relationship.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So if you understand that,

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
then whatever particularly was that past you were thinking of,

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or whatever particular thoughts were pertaining for the future,

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
that's irrelevant.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because you abandoned present,

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
which means you abandoned past, future, and present,

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that were in the present.

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So nothing is left out.

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And in terms of not having to understand,

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
but it's only about that.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, that's true, in a sense,

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you don't have to understand all of the individual factors

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the way the Buddha laid them down,

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
because they're quite subtle,

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but you need to understand this timeless principle,

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
which is why the Buddha called Patitsambhara,

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the Dhamma, Dhamma, Patitsambhara.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's the same.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Actually, was it...

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
One who sees the Buddha sees the Dhamma,

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
one sees the Dhamma, one sees the Buddha.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, that's what the Buddha said.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And then, sorry, Buddha said,

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
in terms of Dhamma, Patitsambhara,

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
or Buddha, Patitsambhara.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What are you saying?

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah.

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Either way, you don't have to understand all of the specific

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
factors of it.

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But you have to understand that principle,

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the big body dismisses is abstract,

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
because you understand that all of these things are implied.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And the fact that the Buddha, quite often,

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
described Patitsambhara differently,

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
sometimes it would have 12 factors,

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
sometimes it would have 15 factors,

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
sometimes it would stop,

205
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
if Nama Rupa, Vinyana, Vinyana, Nama Rupa,

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
he would omit the whole Vinyana,

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Sankara, and then Sankara, Vija.

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He wouldn't talk about it.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So you realize, oh, it's an exemplification

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
of a principle that can be laid out in different ways,

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
but it's still the same principle.

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So if you dismiss the principle,

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you get bogged down in the detail,

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
which becomes, basically,

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
you have to explain it,

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
you have to find the connections,

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and it becomes linear psychological traditional commentary.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But if you keep the principle in mind,

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
as something that has been understood,

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
then you might even not think in terms of

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the way the Buddha laid it down,

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the whole Patitsambhara, it's your own.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You understood the principle,

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and three different ignorance, and it's done.

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because again, all of those individual factors,

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
if you can refer to them as such,

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
it's not one to three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They're all present simultaneously,

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
just on different layers,

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
of present on different layers within the same principle.

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So it is all simultaneous.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But it doesn't mean that again,

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you can approach it,

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you can think in terms of these 12 factors

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
arising at the same time.

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It depends how you look at it.

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The principle arises at the same time.

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
With this, this is.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Now, if you take it further,

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
you can start defining the same principle,

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
further, and further, and further.

242
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And that's how those factors were defined.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But it's not more than that.

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And certainly, it's not about

245
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
drawing linear connection between the factors

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and trying to present a chart

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
that will really encompass it all.

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, that is definitely pointless.

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And won't bring any,

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
well, any timeless understanding.

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And I think the Unreal also mentioned

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
in one of the letters,

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
when somebody asked him,

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
well, this is the first time that they heard

255
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that somebody defines

256
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but did somebody learn that?

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And so on.

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They were not disagreeing with him,

259
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but they were just curious,

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
how is that?

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, he said, well, you know,

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you might have another sort of partner

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
who wouldn't necessarily think in those terms.

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Because if he didn't approach it

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
through that way in terms of understanding,

266
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
he won't be able to recognize that,

267
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
but what he would recognize,

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
what he will know is the principle

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
with this, this is.

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And that principle is contained

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
in that representative insight

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
of a sort of partner,

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
which is whatever has the nature of rising

274
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
for every reason,

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
has the nature of ceasing

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
because it has a reason.

277
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So permanence is implied

278
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
so that's how the being gets undone.

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So again, it's not that, you know,

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
for a sort of partner,

281
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
for another hand, those 12 factors

282
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
just get kind of emerged,

283
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
like a glowing writing in the wall

284
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and it's the principle that can be taken

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
as far as necessary.

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Obviously, the Buddha being the foremost

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
of all of the Buddhas

288
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
in explaining the Dharma,

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
he really explained to the last

290
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
every possible detail,

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
which is why

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the previous Buddha, when he explained

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
the Petit Sampada, he actually didn't go further

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
than Nama Rupa Vinanda.

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Vinanda Nama Rupa.

296
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And again, if you end up,

297
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
if you end the description

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
of the principle,

299
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you end with mutual dependence

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
of two things.

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And two things can be mutually dependent

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
only if they're simultaneously present.

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If two sticks

304
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
hold each other,

305
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
which is that the similissari

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
put the gate for Nama Rupa,

307
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
determining Vinyana, Vinyana,

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
determining Nama Rupa,

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
they have to be up simultaneously.

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
They have to be down

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and then lift the other one.

312
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There is no dependence there.

313
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So the entire relationship

314
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
which have a factor

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
of Petit Sampada,

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
you pick up, is

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
within that nature,

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
shares that nature.

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Simultaneous dependence.

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, this consciousness

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
is actually very important to anything.

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Actually, before

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
many Christian people, they give

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
something like the desire.

325
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah.

326
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Actually,

327
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
after actually knowing

328
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
the teaching of Vinyana,

329
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and then, actually,

330
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
after meditating,

331
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
actually come to see, actually, this

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
consciousness is just like

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
supporting the

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
contact to arise.

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, it's one of the aggregates.

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So if somebody is after

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the bond of understanding,

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
all of the aggregates need to be

339
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
understood.

340
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Obviously, consciousness

341
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
is that which doesn't appear

342
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
like you can't see consciousness

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
directly as an object.

344
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
As you can see a cup

345
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
or a glance, or a door, or a car.

346
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It just doesn't arise there.

347
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Which is why

348
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
most often consciousness is

349
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
that with people regardless

350
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
of one way or the other.

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But the fact that there is

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
something, even if you don't know

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
what it is, but

354
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
that there is a designation

355
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
that you can call consciousness,

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
you can see, and you can even

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
describe it, means there is something

358
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
in your experience that stands

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
for that.

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So, full understanding of that

361
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
would mean full understanding

362
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
of consciousness.

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
In the same way, you would understand

364
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
objects of your senses.

365
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Because it precedes them.

366
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's because your conscious

367
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
objects of your senses can arise.

368
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you are not conscious,

369
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
eyes won't be seen.

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It is won't be hearing.

371
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So it's a

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
negative phenomenon.

373
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And that's why

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
when I told you before,

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
it's very important to

376
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
recognize this actual

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and peripheral,

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
we spoke, because

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
consciousness is the ultimate

380
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
peripheral.

381
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's that peripheral that never

382
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
appears, but it's there.

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And the most

384
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
precisely you can define,

385
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
you would be in the very

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
ambiguous terms,

387
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
such as, it's the presence,

388
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
presence of things.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The fact that things are

390
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
present means consciousness is there.

391
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Obviously, people can now

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
overdo that,

393
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and then end up

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
mystifying consciousness,

395
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
as the example you gave Christians,

396
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
or new age,

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
whatever, religion, really,

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
including Buddhism,

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
when they start over.

400
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's the ultimate consciousness.

401
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's the pure consciousness.

402
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That consciousness is this consciousness.

403
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You overmystify that presence,

404
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
but if there is nothing present,

405
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you can't have the presence.

406
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You need to have a thing

407
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
in order for it to appear.

408
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So, that's why consciousness is

409
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
not independent.

410
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It requires Nama Rupa.

411
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If there isn't,

412
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
consciousness could not

413
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
be discerned.

414
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So, as much as

415
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
consciousness determines that

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
which appears,

417
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
allows it to appear

418
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
to the same extent that which has appeared,

419
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
defines consciousness.

420
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Otherwise, it wouldn't be there.

421
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Consciousness is just

422
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
a six kind.

423
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In particular,

424
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
you don't have to think of them

425
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
at the same time,

426
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
because they get complicated,

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
but you can take a sense.

428
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Eyes are conscious.

429
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Eyes are conscious.

430
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's the thing.

431
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Most of people automatically assume

432
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
matter is out there,

433
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
consciousness is in here.

434
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But actually matter

435
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and consciousness

436
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
are on the same level

437
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
out there.

438
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And their relationship

439
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
is known as Nama Rupa.

440
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And that can have the internal aspect

441
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and external aspect.

442
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So actually, consciousness

443
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
is out there with the things.

444
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Which is why

445
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
it can never be yourself.

446
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
For as long as you think

447
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
it's in here,

448
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
you will be taking it as me.

449
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But if you see it out there,

450
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
in that material world,

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
then you realize,

452
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
well, I cannot have that

453
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
nothing more than I could

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
have matter to be mine.

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And that's

456
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
what Yonero is talking about

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
instead of different terms.

458
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
When he was saying that Rupa

459
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and Vinyana,

460
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
they were

461
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
well superimposed

462
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
or just like two different things

463
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
but they come together.

464
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They don't mix.

465
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I mean, they just get associated.

466
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The result of that

467
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is Nama Rupa.

468
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's the whole world

469
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that you know that you can never know

470
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
your past, your future.

471
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's all within Nama Rupa.

472
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Within the conscious matter.

473
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Because if your consciousness is truly

474
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
in you, it would be independent from the body.

475
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But when that material body

476
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
gets disintegrated,

477
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
consciousness goes.

478
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It cannot stay.

479
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You mean that the sense of self.

480
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Sense of self.

481
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The consciousness is in the body,

482
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
you know?

483
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No.

484
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why would it be?

485
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
With the consciousness,

486
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
this body consciousness is associated

487
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
with the body.

488
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The reason you can look in or out

489
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
or in and out or wherever you want

490
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
is because you are already conscious.

491
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So the sense of space

492
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
the direction where you look

493
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is possible only because

494
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
the body is already conscious.

495
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The consciousness, the five aggregates

496
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
are already there.

497
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So it's secondary to that.

498
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If it's secondary means

499
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you can't use it then to find

500
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
its origin.

501
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Not the origin.

502
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And if you, you know,

503
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you look in the distance and you see

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
the tree really, really far out.

505
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, your consciousness is out there.

506
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Consciousness is out there.

507
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I mean the...

508
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Doesn't mean it's in that matter.

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Means it's associated with that matter.

510
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
No matter how far it is.

511
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Whether it's in your thoughts or through your senses.

512
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's actually external.

513
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
For other hand,

514
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
all of the aggregates become external.

515
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Externally.

516
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
External means you mean

517
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
that they're not serve in the...

518
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, yes, for other hand, yes.

519
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
External means not serve.

520
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And the Buddha did say that

521
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
for somebody completely free from ignorance,

522
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
what is left is

523
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
this conscious body

524
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and all

525
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
whatever name and form externally.

526
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's what's left.

527
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So the body

528
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
that is associated with the consciousness

529
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
or consciousness associated with the body

530
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
is just like

531
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
two completely different things

532
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
that kind of come and stop together

533
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
which is the birth.

534
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But then

535
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
when one of them goes

536
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
the other one cannot remain standing.

537
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But it's not that consciousness enters

538
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
in the body.

539
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Because any notion of space

540
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
is the fact that you're conscious.

541
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So consciousness cannot be

542
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
in its own result.

543
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
For other hand,

544
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
does any idea appear that

545
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
as my body, but the thought itself

546
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is not this.

547
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Well, even when he thinks my

548
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
eye, I am or I am this

549
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
or this is my carp order,

550
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
that doesn't imply

551
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the emotional significance

552
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
of me and sense of self.

553
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
In other words, I can say that's my cup

554
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
but if somebody comes and steal it

555
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I won't suffer an account of it.

556
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But as a designation of speech

557
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you can, you know, in the Buddha said that.

558
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well, the target that says I am

559
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but it doesn't mean that he really thinks he is.

560
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He's just the figure of speech

561
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
becomes for him.

562
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Where a practitioner, when he says

563
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I am for him, that is his sense of self.

564
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So as a designation, it's valid.

565
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You have to designate it somehow.

566
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He's just a misunderstanding

567
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
that goes with it.

568
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's removed.

569
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
In case of an other hand.

570
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You thought itself was different?

571
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Actually, different, you know, I think?

572
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well, differently as much as there is no

573
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
greedy version of the illusion ever.

574
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Again, to arise.

575
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, they cannot appear.

576
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Cannot.

577
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
No. So, he's not just temporarily free from

578
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
greedy version of the illusion.

579
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
An other hand, he's free from

580
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
a possibility of those things arising.

581
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Which is why he's another hand.

582
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
There might be pleasing thoughts,

583
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
displeasing thoughts, neutral thoughts.

584
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But pleasing thoughts won't be inducing

585
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
any more lust.

586
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Displeasing thoughts won't be inducing any anger.

587
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And neutral thoughts won't be inducing any delusion.

588
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Hmm.

589
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Displeasing.

590
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
How it happens in the mind of our hunter?

591
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Displeasing.

592
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Displeasingness.

593
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, this is disagreeable.

594
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's a feeling.

595
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Well, I know, because if you could see the difference,

596
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
you would be on a way to become an hunter.

597
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
How can something be displeasing

598
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
without implying

599
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
ill will or aversion?

600
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Hmm.

601
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If you can see that, then, oh, keep doing it.

602
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And then you learn how to be displeased

603
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
without being angry.

604
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Hmm. Which means you free yourself from anger.

605
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Hmm.

606
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But

607
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
you can't, like, feeling

608
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
as feeling for a protugina

609
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
is not the same...

610
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, it's not the same

611
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
as arrogance feeling

612
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
as an aggregate.

613
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So then, that's why,

614
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
when the Buddha would talk,

615
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
he would make a categorical difference.

616
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
He would say, no feeling.

617
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
In case of an argument,

618
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
because there's no protugina feeling.

619
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
No.

620
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But that doesn't mean that he's just dead.

621
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Because, again, that's another protugina's reference, then.

622
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Hmm.

623
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And none of the protugina's references

624
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
can apply to another hunt.

625
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Which is why, again, we have said,

626
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
if protugina would understand

627
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
what a state of our hunt is,

628
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
he would be on the way to become one.

629
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Hmm.

630
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So it's not that you can get a clear idea

631
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
and still be a protugina.

632
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Clear idea frees you from the state of protugina.

633
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Hmm.

634
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Hmm.

635
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
In the case of an argument,

636
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
it's different.

637
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Well, it's in between.

638
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So, the overall picture,

639
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
the fundamental principle,

640
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
that's all understood,

641
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
that's all set.

642
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But they have to keep repeating it.

643
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Until all the habits,

644
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
they were based on unwholesome,

645
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
greedy version delusion,

646
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
disappear,

647
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and then they can stop.

648
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So, if you're trying to have, like, a clear definition,

649
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
you can't.

650
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's just,

651
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
well, the most precise you can get

652
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
is what Buddha himself used

653
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
to describe the four different

654
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
stages of enlightenment.

655
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But in the beginning,

656
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
they weren't.

657
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
He didn't. They didn't exist.

658
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That doesn't mean the dhamma didn't exist

659
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
or the stages didn't exist.

660
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It was basically somebody who understood the dhamma

661
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and somebody who fully developed it

662
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and now went beyond and is free.

663
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And then there was that whole,

664
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
whole chapter in Samyutani Kavan,

665
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
whenever somebody would die,

666
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
renderable under,

667
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
would go to the Buddha and ask him,

668
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
oh, such and such person died.

669
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What's their destination?

670
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And then we say,

671
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
oh, he will return one more time,

672
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
or he won't return it all.

673
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh, he will be reborn in this heaven.

674
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
He will be reborn.

675
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But it was just becoming all the time.

676
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
He said, well, if,

677
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
he will ask me about the river,

678
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
it's just going to be a real bother for me.

679
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So why don't I tell you something,

680
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
that you can use as a criteria

681
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
to decide for yourself

682
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
where most likely that person will be reborn?

683
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So Sotabana,

684
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
at most, will have seven rivers.

685
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
He might have less.

686
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So it's not.

687
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Sotabati, seven,

688
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
or something like that.

689
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's a guideline.

690
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's like a little

691
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
stopping points

692
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
of one, actually,

693
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
just one process,

694
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
which is developing,

695
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
understanding the Dharma,

696
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and fully developing that understanding.

697
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So then he would say,

698
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
he's suffering and we would return one more time.

699
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And then he wouldn't return.

700
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And then he would give that in relation to the ten fetters.

701
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Because,

702
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
by dwelling on those ten fetters,

703
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
by contemplating them,

704
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
you will, you can fully understand them.

705
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And when you fully understand them,

706
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
you understand that you understood.

707
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So it's not like, oh,

708
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
however understood means, oh, there is doubt there.

709
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It means you haven't understand them enough.

710
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So sometimes people might,

711
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
when they get,

712
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
when they're overestimate themselves,

713
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
or are just plain deluded,

714
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
they refuse to doubt.

715
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And they think that's the way to go beyond the doubt.

716
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
When they just do not doubt.

717
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
If somebody doubts, they just ignore that.

718
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
If somebody doesn't know,

719
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I think no, no, I refuse to accept that.

720
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But that's just ridiculous.

721
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Doesn't, doesn't work like that.

722
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So you should doubt all the time.

723
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Because doubt keeps turning things around.

724
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And then,

725
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it can make you, it can enable you

726
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
to develop understanding

727
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
that will then be truly impenetrable

728
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
to your full-on acts of doubt.

729
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Because if you never doubt,

730
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
you don't know if you'll be on the doubt.

731
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
If you doubt all the time

732
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and learn how to,

733
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
while doubting, go beyond that doubt,

734
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
ah, then you can truly know for yourself

735
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and you cannot doubt that.

736
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Because you're doubting,

737
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and it makes no difference.

738
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Lord Buddha, you encouraged people to

739
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
question some doubts.

740
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Whenever for you,

742
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
you're actually not only one.

743
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Several times tower me that

744
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Lord Buddha actually said

745
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
that we must believe what he said.

746
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And not,

747
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
you don't actually encourage people

748
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
to question beliefs.

749
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's not correct.

750
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
No, it's not correct.

751
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Oh, yeah, he said, don't take my word for it.

752
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
He said that himself.

753
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Don't just believe what I say.

754
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's great for you if you have such faith.

755
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But you don't have to.

756
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
No, you should examine it

757
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and see why is it so.

758
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And then your faith will be unshakable.

759
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Because you understood it.

760
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah.

761
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Quite the opposite, quite the opposite.

762
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Because often, yes, you would have, no, no, just don't doubt.

763
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Just do what I said. Stop asking.

764
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
No, no, he was, like, he would even encourage monks

765
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
to keep interrogating each other all the time.

766
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Because that's how you progress.

767
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That's how you develop understanding.

768
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Obviously, sometimes people can take that,

769
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
oh, well, the Buddha encourages us to doubt and to question.

770
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And then you state that for just being argumentative.

771
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You know, when somebody just wants to argue

772
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
over any little point.

773
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And then, well, the Buddha won't know.

774
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
He didn't say that. He said, if you have a genuine interest,

775
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
you have to keep overturning things.

776
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And like digging, digging, and digging, and digging,

777
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
while you're through conversation with others

778
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
all inside of your mind.

779
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Because that's how understanding can come.

780
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But, yes, sometimes people just use that as an excuse

781
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
to indulge their habits of arguments

782
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
or just enjoying the debate or things like that.

783
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And he didn't encourage that.

784
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
He didn't encourage debates for the sake of debate.

785
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I think in the history, this is actually

786
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I really wanted to know it.

787
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I think there are a few other things that share

788
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
even from that, even for the Buddha's channel, you can see

789
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
the career, the record is perfect.

790
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I've said, there are so many cases that in sutra

791
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I've mentioned that there are some areas

792
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
that are like immoral or whatever.

793
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But I actually want to understand this.

794
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Some people thought he was angry.

795
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But there is no anger in his mind.

796
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah.

797
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
How much does it have?

798
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because I heard it's a very harsh speech.

799
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yeah, that was your case.

800
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Well, the first thing is, it's possible.

801
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But it's very unlikely.

802
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So when you get cases like that,

803
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
there are a few cases in the sutras,

804
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
or even Vanderbilt Chana and Sariput,

805
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
the one who committed suicide,

806
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
the Buddha thought that he wasn't an other hand.

807
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And Buddha said, well, why do you say that?

808
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Because he was associating with bad families,

809
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
with families of bad reputation.

810
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
He was very close with them.

811
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So they all thought, bad of him.

812
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But they said, no, he wasn't an other hand.

813
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So the external measure, it's not necessarily a measure.

814
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And the putusions criteria cannot encompass an other hand.

815
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And if they do, it's accidentally.

816
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They don't know why.

817
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But nevertheless, from, I think, probably for 80 or 90%

818
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
of people, 100 means there won't be any of those things left.

819
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I think there is some, well, like in the case of an angry,

820
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
well, seemingly angry aren't.

821
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The Buddha said, well, the reason why his speech is still like that,

822
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
is for 500 lifetimes.

823
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
500 times, he was reborn and lived, I don't know, a long time.

824
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So let's just say he lived 80 years each time.

825
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's like, oh, 4,000?

826
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
4,000.

827
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But it's 4,000, 4,000 years.

828
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
He was reborn in the Brahmin family.

829
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And they were always higher than the others.

830
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
They would always speak convincingly to the others.

831
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So the habit just got so established that even he became an other hand.

832
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He's actually just calculating the same form of speech.

833
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The feeling itself is different for their hands.

834
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
There's no angry.

835
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I was thinking there was something kind of anger that taught itself

836
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
already disowned.

837
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Well, again, the only way you can look at it is through your own.

838
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Like, window or experience, you can't really.

839
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And you can actually relate to that.

840
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm sure everyone at some point experienced when some person

841
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
told you something that you really believed it was like that.

842
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And then you realized it was completely different.

843
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
While they were saying this, they meant something completely different.

844
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And you didn't know that.

845
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You couldn't know that.

846
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So in the same sense, when you come across somebody who speaks angrily,

847
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
you end up assuming he's angry.

848
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But then you can find a later on that actually, no, he wasn't.

849
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
He just says, have it.

850
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Or if you go again, like, you know,

851
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I've been in Thailand, Sri Lanka.

852
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So you see the different cultures, different things people do.

853
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And sometimes, some things people do in Thailand

854
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
consider very rude in Europe.

855
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And vice versa, something we do in Europe.

856
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So you know that there can be a different significance

857
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
of the identical external output.

858
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So you can do something exactly the same in one country.

859
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Do exactly the same in another country.

860
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It can be completely different.

861
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Or even coming from the same person.

862
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Sometimes you can say something exactly the same.

863
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And be angry about it.

864
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Sometimes you can say something exactly the same.

865
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And not be angry about it.

866
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So anger is indifferent to that.

867
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Often it's a manifestation of anger.

868
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I act of both the speech of mind.

869
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But if there is no anger, there is still both the speech of mind.

870
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And they will still be doing things.

871
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And that's why it's a manifestation of anger.

872
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hmm.

873
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
For areas, is it correct that I was thinking that

874
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Aria means totally, I think,

875
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
become indifferent to any feeling or thought.

876
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Or is it?

877
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Actually, that's why I was thinking that some of

878
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
these behavioral, not the arhanda, are areas.

879
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I basically couldn't understand because

880
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
any kind of an Angkor Santhor,

881
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
in the case of Aria, not the arhanda.

882
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Just an Aria means totally indifferent to such a feeling of thought.

883
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well, no.

884
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Totally different would be an arhanda.

885
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Different.

886
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Totally indifferent would be an arhanda.

887
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Totally indifferent means the economy.

888
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
There would be fully developed to pay car.

889
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's totally indifferent.

890
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
40,000, by the way.

891
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So, in case of an Aria,

892
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
again, it depends on how far his faculties developed.

893
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Like, you know, when...

894
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Well, there was that sutra when the Buddha

895
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
was staying in that forest.

896
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And on the other side of that forest,

897
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
it was a group of young men and women.

898
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
They paid those courtesans to come with them in the forest.

899
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
They were all getting loose and central.

900
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And then they all fell asleep after.

901
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And one of them woke up,

902
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
one of the courtesans woke up and stole all of their gold money.

903
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And ran away.

904
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
When they realized they start chasing them.

905
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So, imagine their state of mind

906
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
after this pleasure,

907
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
central evening,

908
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
and then full of anger over like,

909
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
oh, we've been deceived and so on,

910
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
they were chasing to kill her most likely.

911
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And then they accidentally,

912
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
as they were chasing,

913
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
they came across the Buddha.

914
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
They didn't even know he was the Buddha.

915
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And so, he told them,

916
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
well, why don't you sit down

917
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and I can teach you something instead.

918
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
They will be more beneficial to you than finding that gold.

919
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So, you know,

920
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm sure some of them come down,

921
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
but still,

922
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm pretty sure they're still angry.

923
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And then upset.

924
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yet, right there and then,

925
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
he calmed them down.

926
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
He first he talked about the significance of virtue,

927
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
why it's good to develop in generosity.

928
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
They understood that because everybody can understand that.

929
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And there was a sufficient basis for them to then

930
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
develop right view,

931
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
because then he spoke about the Dharma

932
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and they understood exactly what he meant.

933
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And they all became sort of honest.

934
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So, you realize,

935
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
oh, okay,

936
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
it's not that hard then.

937
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
If somebody can have their mind full of lust

938
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and then aversion and anger,

939
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and then they could come down

940
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and then they could see the nature of things.

941
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But that doesn't oblige them to follow it.

942
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So, they might have well understood it,

943
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but I think it comes from their previous rights.

944
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I mean, they have many practices.

945
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Well, I think what comes from previous life

946
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
is the fact that you're born as human

947
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
with all of your faculties intact.

948
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Nothing else excuses somebody

949
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
for not understanding Dharma

950
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
or understanding it.

951
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
In other words,

952
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
those who make the effort will understand

953
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
those who don't, they won't.

954
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But yeah, there is something's previous life,

955
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
but I think people put too much emphasis in that

956
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
as a way of absorbing

957
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
themself from responsibility.

958
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh, well, no.

959
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
If you're a born, intelligent,

960
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
normal, human being who can think normally,

961
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
discern normally,

962
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
there is no excuse for not understanding Dharma.

963
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
They're just seasoned.

964
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Everything is there.

965
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So, if you don't understand it,

966
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
because you haven't been making the right effort.

967
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And it's kind of blunt,

968
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
but that's exactly how it is.

969
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So,

970
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
when you had those,

971
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
like when sometimes the householders

972
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
would come and see the Buddha

973
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
or even come to complain about something,

974
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
or criticize you,

975
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and then he would come and down,

976
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
talk about them,

977
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and then they would understand them,

978
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and become sort of honest.

979
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And sometimes they would say,

980
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
oh, from now on,

981
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm going to become a monk,

982
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and practice this.

983
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But sometimes they would,

984
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and sometimes they would say,

985
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
well, thank you, Lord.

986
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We are very busy.

987
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We have to go back home,

988
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
we have lots of things to attend to.

989
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
As sort of honest,

990
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
like his father,

991
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
when his father came and complained about

992
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
because he ordained him,

993
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
he came only tears and upset.

994
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Because, well, first you went,

995
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
now you took my only grandson.

996
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But then the Buddha came down,

997
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
made him a sort of money

998
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
through explaining the dharma,

999
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and they all,

1000
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
thank you very much,

1001
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I have to go now, I'm busy.

1002
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So, they don't necessarily always want to practice it,

1003
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
especially because, oh,

1004
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
this understanding is already quite an accomplishment,

1005
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and they get content in that,

1006
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
which means that three quarters

1007
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
of their mind still needs to be

1008
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
dealt with,

1009
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
but they don't.

1010
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
They're still one quarter.

1011
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So, the spirit,

1012
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
it's not that clear,

1013
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
clear cut,

1014
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
but in the nutshell,

1015
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
then the student of one needs to be done,

1016
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
but they don't necessarily want to do it right now.

1017
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
They will eventually,

1018
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
they can't ignore it for too long,

1019
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
which is why,

1020
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
so the one is that,

1021
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
at most, seven beavers,

1022
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
no more than that.

1023
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So, that, and even, even that,

1024
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
the whole, as I said before,

1025
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
the whole,

1026
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the vision of Suttapana,

1027
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Saka Gamyal Gamyal Gamyal Gamy,

1028
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
sometimes the Buddha

1029
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
would omit Saka the Gamy,

1030
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
even he would just say,

1031
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Suttapana,

1032
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and then he would start talking about Anagami,

1033
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and then he would talk about Anagami,

1034
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and as I said,

1035
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
in the beginning,

1036
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
they were not.

1037
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
He was just fully enlightened,

1038
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
or not fully enlightened.

1039
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So, it's a guideline.

1040
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's a guideline,

1041
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I don't know, basically,

1042
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
of understanding the Dharma.

1043
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And he was also a guideline,

1044
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
given to people to reassure them,

1045
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
just reason they came again,

1046
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
across that sort of,

1047
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Mahanam and the household there,

1048
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
who was,

1049
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
he wasn't clear in the suitors,

1050
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
whether he was Saka the Gamyal Suttapana,

1051
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
because he was never said,

1052
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
he was always said that he's a noble disciple,

1053
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
who still lives the household life.

1054
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And,

1055
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and there was this, this Suttapana,

1056
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and he says,

1057
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
so he knew that he was a,

1058
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
well, he knew that he was a noble disciple,

1059
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
but it was before the Buddha,

1060
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
defined all of these seven reverts,

1061
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
so he came to the Buddha one night,

1062
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
one evening, and he said,

1063
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
oh, how is it Lord that,

1064
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
like, you know,

1065
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm the one who understood the Dharma,

1066
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and I know that I understood it,

1067
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and so on.

1068
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
But on some occasions,

1069
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
when I walk on the,

1070
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
like now,

1071
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
when I come to see the Lord in the evening,

1072
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and it's getting dark,

1073
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and if I come across,

1074
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
a stray dog,

1075
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
a stray man,

1076
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
or a stray elephant,

1077
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
or some form of danger,

1078
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
he forgets about all the Dharma he understood,

1079
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
and, you know, he gets filled with fear,

1080
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and then he says,

1081
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
what if I were to die

1082
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
at that moment,

1083
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
on account of that stray dog,

1084
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
stray elephant or stray man,

1085
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
what would my destination be?

1086
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So he was concerned,

1087
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
that if he dies in that state of mind,

1088
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
although he knew that he was a noble disciple,

1089
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
he was concerned,

1090
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and if he dies in that state of mind,

1091
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
his destination might be unfortunate,

1092
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
because,

1093
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
unless you have a supernatural body,

1094
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
you can't see those things.

1095
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And the Buddha said,

1096
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
oh, you have absolutely nothing to fear.

1097
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
The one who understood the Dharma,

1098
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
who developed that kind of noble virtue,

1099
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
noble understanding,

1100
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
nobody's,

1101
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
even if your mind is overwhelmed with fear,

1102
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
when you die,

1103
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
it still won't make a difference

1104
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
to your destination.

1105
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But the interesting bit, to me,

1106
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that is that,

1107
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
oh, there was a sotapanarsaka,

1108
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
the Rami,

1109
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
who wasn't sure about certain things.

1110
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
He was sure about the nature of the Dharma,

1111
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
but he doesn't know

1112
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
how far he's understanding of the Dharma,

1113
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
the real understanding of the Dharma,

1114
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
how far he takes him,

1115
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and for that,

1116
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
the Buddha would often talk,

1117
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
like,

1118
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I will see the mountain,

1119
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Himalayas,

1120
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and then he would pick up seven grains of sand.

1121
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And he said,

1122
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
the size of that mountain

1123
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
is the size of suffering

1124
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
that sotapana has abandoned,

1125
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
and all he has left,

1126
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
is the amount of this,

1127
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
seven grains of sand.

1128
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So that's how much he has destroyed.

1129
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So it's quite an accomplishment,

1130
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
even to get that understanding.

1131
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And that's why he will give those encirigments

1132
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
of that kind,

1133
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but sotapana doesn't see that.

1134
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
He sees the Dharma,

1135
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
he sees the time of principle,

1136
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
he sees the four noble truths,

1137
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
he sees the way out of suffering,

1138
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and actually that in itself,

1139
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
is more than enough.

1140
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
All of this comes in as an extra.

1141
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Over the other hand,

1142
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
they don't remember their previous,

1143
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
not over, not only some.

1144
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Sorry, Buddha couldn't remember,

1145
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I knew it.

1146
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
He said,

1147
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
the foremost,

1148
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
after the Buddha,

1149
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
in teaching the Dharma,

1150
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
in expanding every angle,

1151
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and approach,

1152
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
just like,

1153
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
you know,

1154
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
people couldn't see the difference

1155
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
whether he would speak of the Buddha,

1156
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
because he understood all of it,

1157
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
but he said he couldn't see

1158
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
even a little goblin.

1159
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Like nothing,

1160
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
he couldn't see any of that.

1161
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Neither supernatural,

1162
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
nothing,

1163
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
he was just non-existent for him,

1164
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
which is why it's irrelevant,

1165
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
whether you see it or not.

1166
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It makes no difference.

1167
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Some people can,

1168
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
but...

1169
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I was thinking that remembering the past,

1170
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
it's very important to understand the role of karma.

1171
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It's not necessary.

1172
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
No, no, no.

1173
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
If karma is truly

1174
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
determined by your past,

1175
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
you're stuck.

1176
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You can't do anything about it.

1177
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
If Angoli Mala's karma was in his past,

1178
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
he couldn't have not overcome it,

1179
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
because he couldn't bring those people back to life.

1180
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Action is intention,

1181
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
and intention is very present thing,

1182
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and things you do are very present,

1183
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and that's where you abandon it.

1184
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And when you abandon your...

1185
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Through, like, a full understanding,

1186
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
through abandoning ignorance,

1187
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
when you abandon your action by both this speech and mind,

1188
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
nothing you have done,

1189
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
nothing you would have done

1190
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
can pertain to you anymore.

1191
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
In the same sense,

1192
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
when you abandon the nature of present,

1193
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
what's present,

1194
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
you abandon past that can be present,

1195
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
you abandon future that can be present,

1196
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and you abandon present,

1197
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
that's present.

1198
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
There are some people

1199
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
they are always doing wrong things,

1200
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
but it's quite important

1201
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
to understand karma.

1202
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Well, no, it's not action, no.

1203
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I think it's important for them to understand Vipaka.

1204
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Because karma,

1205
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I think the whole notion

1206
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
you've got overly mystified now,

1207
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
it almost becomes like this energy

1208
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
of righteousness,

1209
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
like, well, that's your karma,

1210
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
you deserve it,

1211
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
or things like that,

1212
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
but karma means action.

1213
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Feeling this carpet water is a form of karma.

1214
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Whole sum,

1215
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
around whole sum,

1216
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
people might want to dwell on Vipaka

1217
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
on the results,

1218
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
on that karma.

1219
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And that's something

1220
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
that can cause sense awareness,

1221
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
because if you start thinking,

1222
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
well, if I misbehaved,

1223
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
if I do these things,

1224
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I could end up experiencing

1225
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
very bad results,

1226
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and then that can inspire them

1227
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
to be more whole sum

1228
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and do less evil

1229
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
or whatever they've been doing before.

1230
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But in terms of thinking about karma,

1231
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and understanding the workings of the karma,

1232
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
or something like that,

1233
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
the Buddha said

1234
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
that it can only bring madness

1235
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
or destruction.

1236
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Unless you're a Buddha,

1237
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
who can then fully understand

1238
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the workings of the karma,

1239
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
if he directs his mind towards it,

1240
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
if somebody else tries,

1241
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
you just end up distracting yourself

1242
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
about pointless things,

1243
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
or go mad on account

1244
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
of really trying to understand

1245
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
something that you cannot possibly comprehend.

1246
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Which, enough,

1247
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
it just says it in a different way,

1248
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
it's irrelevant

1249
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
in terms of understanding.

1250
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Like you understand the nature of action,

1251
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
you abandon it,

1252
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
but you don't understand,

1253
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
why when you've done something

1254
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
in the past now,

1255
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
that was the result of this,

1256
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
that's a complete

1257
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
like looking elsewhere

1258
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
in a wrong direction.

1259
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
How Buddha could teach

1260
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
the importance to be a Burgess,

1261
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
the Burgess,

1262
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
how would he teach it?

1263
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Well, he would teach that

1264
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
because of the,

1265
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
he would say about the Vipaka,

1266
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
he would say about the results.

1267
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And then again,

1268
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
even that,

1269
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
he said,

1270
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
well, don't believe what I say,

1271
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
but reflect for yourself.

1272
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And I think I've already said before,

1273
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
when you told those people,

1274
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
okay,

1275
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
it's a fact that you don't know

1276
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
whether there is an ex-life or not.

1277
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It's a matter of belief,

1278
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
you don't want to take it or you want to know.

1279
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But actually,

1280
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
even then,

1281
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
you can use your intelligence.

1282
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So even puttuja,

1283
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I can understand that,

1284
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
whereby you can kick in just,

1285
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
basically,

1286
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
sit and think,

1287
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
okay, I don't know

1288
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
that there is a future life,

1289
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
or not.

1290
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
If I misbehave here,

1291
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
right now, in this life,

1292
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
well, I'll get in trouble

1293
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
from people,

1294
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
that's a fact,

1295
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I'll be put in jail,

1296
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
people will hate me,

1297
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
if I get away with it,

1298
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
people will trust me,

1299
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I have to be on the run,

1300
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I have to keep looking

1301
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
around all the time,

1302
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I'll live in fear,

1303
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
or whatever,

1304
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
so that's all unhoveled,

1305
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
some states.

1306
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And then,

1307
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
if there is a future life,

1308
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
then he'll experience

1309
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
even worse rebirth

1310
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
when a count of bad actions.

1311
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
If there isn't no future life,

1312
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
okay, he won't experience

1313
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
any bad rebirth,

1314
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
but he'll still suffer

1315
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
in this life when a count

1316
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
of his bad actions.

1317
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Now, the other person

1318
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
who thinks,

1319
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
well,

1320
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
if I do good in this life,

1321
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
well, people will praise me,

1322
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
which is nice,

1323
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
people will be helpful to me,

1324
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
which is nice,

1325
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
people will want to

1326
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
repay my kindness,

1327
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
which is nice,

1328
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
people will trust me,

1329
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
which is nice.

1330
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And then,

1331
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
if there is no future life,

1332
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
well, so big,

1333
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
at least,

1334
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I live a good life here.

1335
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
If there is a future life,

1336
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
then I'll also get a better

1337
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
rebirth,

1338
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
so I'll win on both fronts,

1339
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
and if I misbehave,

1340
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'll lose on both fronts.

1341
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So even then,

1342
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
it doesn't have to be a matter

1343
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
of belief anymore.

1344
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
There is a clear understanding,

1345
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
almost a practical,

1346
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and oh,

1347
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
so it's actually,

1348
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
that's why this is awesome.

1349
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
That's why that's awesome.

1350
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's why it's better to behave,

1351
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
than to misbehave.

1352
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And then,

1353
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
they have no knowledge

1354
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
of previous lives,

1355
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
no knowledge of

1356
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
future Vipaka,

1357
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
waiting for them,

1358
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
is just intelligence,

1359
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
human intelligence,

1360
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
basic discerning.

1361
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You just stop and think,

1362
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
for a second,

1363
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
and it becomes apparent.

1364
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Because there's no denying

1365
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
that if you do unwholesome things,

1366
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
people will complain.

1367
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
If you meet someone,

1368
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
if you can't stop doing wrongdoing,

1369
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
how you can...

1370
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Some people,

1371
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
there's a problem in front of me,

1372
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
keep killing the snakes,

1373
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and all of those things,

1374
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
and it's impossible for them to stop.

1375
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
They say,

1376
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
it's impossible.

1377
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
How do you...

1378
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
No, they're lying to themselves.

1379
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
If they say it's impossible,

1380
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
what that means,

1381
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
doesn't mean it's impossible,

1382
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
it means they can't be bothered

1383
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
to try to stop.

1384
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So they'll keep doing it.

1385
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
But you can't stop it,

1386
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
if they don't want to stop it.

1387
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Unless you're stronger than them,

1388
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and twist their arm,

1389
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and restrain them

1390
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
until the snake escapes.

1391
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You can't do it.

1392
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So...

1393
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So you never give in otherwise?

1394
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Well, the reason,

1395
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I mean, you could...

1396
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Again,

1397
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
if you can...

1398
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
If you try to convince people too hard,

1399
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
they will start

1400
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
ignoring you even harder.

1401
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So unless the person who just

1402
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
done something silly,

1403
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
unwholesome in front of you,

1404
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
is not willing to listen to you.

1405
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
No amount of things you say,

1406
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
and you'll be wasting your words then.

1407
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
They won't take any heed.

1408
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
If they come and...

1409
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Oh, yeah, okay, well,

1410
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
like if they really want to understand it,

1411
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
then it's a different matter.

1412
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Matter.

1413
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And then you can tell them

1414
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
just what I told you now.

1415
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Like,

1416
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
even if you don't know

1417
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
whether you're bad action,

1418
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
we'll bring the...

1419
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
the future misery in terms of the future rebirth.

1420
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Well, you can still know for sure

1421
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
that in this life,

1422
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
it will.

1423
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And also,

1424
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
the fact is that you don't know

1425
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
whether you're going to be reborn or not.

1426
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Surely you should play it safe.

1427
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
As if you are going to be reborn.

1428
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So just in case,

1429
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'll behave here.

1430
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I'll be praised here on my behavior.

1431
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And if there is a future rebirth,

1432
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
then I'll be safe.

1433
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So it's almost like a precaution.

1434
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Just in case I'll behave.

1435
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
If I know for sure that there is no life,

1436
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
this is going to live here,

1437
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I'll do whatever I like,

1438
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
but you cannot know that for sure.

1439
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And that's something you can know.

1440
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You can know for sure

1441
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
that you don't know these things for sure

1442
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
and you can never will,

1443
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
which is why it's better to

1444
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
use wisdom and say,

1445
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
well, why would I like a risk?

1446
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Especially when

1447
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
we're not risking our behaving properly,

1448
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
we'll only respect in this life

1449
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and protect in the future life

1450
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
if there is one.

1451
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It's a winner in every respect.

1452
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But people usually say,

1453
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
well, I don't know that there is a rebirth.

1454
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Well, yeah.

1455
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But you don't know that there isn't a rebirth,

1456
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
but they don't think that far.

1457
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
They just think the first part

1458
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
because that means,

1459
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
oh, well, I don't believe that

1460
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I can do what I want here.

1461
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
But actually,

1462
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
even if you don't believe or believe,

1463
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
if you stop and think,

1464
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
it would become apparent

1465
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
why you shouldn't be doing those things.

1466
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But again,

1467
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
unless a person is willing to hear that,

1468
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
everyone listen to you.

1469
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
They don't want this to anybody.

1470
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You know,

1471
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
a lot of people don't really get quite.

1472
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Well, yeah,

1473
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
sometimes people come and ask,

1474
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
ask him the wrong question

1475
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
or they would formulate the question wrongly.

1476
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
She said that.

1477
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Sometimes the target that

1478
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
meets this person

1479
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and the target that has inclination

1480
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
to teach him.

1481
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
But then this misguided person

1482
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
formulates his question wrongly

1483
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and then the target that goes silent.

1484
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And that's what I teach him then.

1485
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Ah, yeah.

1486
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Because they came from a wrong place.

1487
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Because whatever he says,

1488
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
they'll take it wrongly.

1489
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Or sometimes they come with the question

1490
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and ask him,

1491
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
like when they ask him,

1492
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
oh, must they go down?

1493
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Is there a self?

1494
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So if you say,

1495
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
yes, there is,

1496
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
but there isn't that person

1497
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
who will take,

1498
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
that's not self.

1499
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
A self.

1500
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Because you already implied in his question,

1501
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
that there is a self.

1502
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So which one is it?

1503
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So the Buddha was quiet.

1504
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
He said,

1505
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
well, does that mean there isn't?

1506
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Well, there isn't.

1507
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
There isn't.

1508
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Or both.

1509
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
No, yeah.

1510
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And he was just quiet.

1511
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And then this person left.

1512
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And I asked him,

1513
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
why didn't you answer?

1514
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
He said, well,

1515
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
because whatever I would have said,

1516
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
he would have misunderstood.

1517
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Why?

1518
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Because he was coming

1519
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
with a completely wrong attitude.

1520
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So he wasn't willing to understand.

1521
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Then I think on a later occasion,

1522
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
when I'm in the told him,

1523
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
you should answer like this.

1524
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Don't answer like that.

1525
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And then he asked rightly,

1526
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
that the target of the told him

1527
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and then he understood.

1528
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Because that's a big surprise.

1529
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
We thought that,

1530
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
when I was going up on you,

1531
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
actually, he first told me

1532
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
that there is no self.

1533
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
He's wrong.

1534
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
There is no self.

1535
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Before, always,

1536
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I heard that,

1537
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
the old monks,

1538
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
they teach there is no self.

1539
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
There is no self.

1540
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's a denial.

1541
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
He is quiet.

1542
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I have seen,

1543
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and didn't notice my mistake.

1544
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And he told me,

1545
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
that in the case of Potuchana,

1546
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
it's impossible to say that

1547
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
there is no self.

1548
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Exactly.

1549
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
But why many monks

1550
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
they don't know is there?

1551
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Well, because they are Potuchana's.

1552
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Yeah, maybe.

1553
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Like,

1554
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
if somebody is not a Potuchana,

1555
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
they would know,

1556
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
they wouldn't be saying it.

1557
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's not written in sutra

1558
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
that for Potuchana,

1559
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
we can't say that there is no self.

1560
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Nothing written.

1561
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Nothing.

1562
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Nothing.

1563
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I mean, Potuchana

1564
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
should see through the nature of herself,

1565
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
that it cannot be his,

1566
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and that's why it becomes not self.

1567
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It doesn't mean no self.

1568
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It's not self.

1569
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It's not self.

1570
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's not myself.

1571
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I think that's not just that everywhere,

1572
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
in the West, in the entire of everywhere.

1573
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
That's not just in Sri Lanka.

1574
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Because when anybody comes across Buddhism

1575
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
on the superficial terms,

1576
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
that's the first thing you come across.

1577
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Ah, there is no self.

1578
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And then that negative,

1579
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
like, becomes yourself.

1580
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, yes.

1581
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I don't believe in self.

1582
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
That's my self, believe.

1583
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It's much harder than that.

1584
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
As I said before,

1585
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
no, you actually have to first see

1586
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
what your self is,

1587
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
in order to stop regarding it as yours.

1588
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And that's a very different thing.

1589
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And that's why you have atta,

1590
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
and then you have an atta,

1591
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
like, not, no self,

1592
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
but not self.

1593
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
But that which is taken as self,

1594
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
and then understood as not self,

1595
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
is still there.

1596
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
That thing doesn't change.

1597
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
But when you say no self,

1598
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
you just deny the whole thing.

1599
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
For us they are self,

1600
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
but it's not self.

1601
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
There is that which used to be taken as self.

1602
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Used to be.

1603
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yeah, but now there is no self.

1604
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
No, self.

1605
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Or rather it's not self.

1606
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Not self.

1607
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Every experience of an arahant is not self.

1608
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
No, self.

1609
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
What does it mean that the eight-pukarande,

1610
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
the one-pukarande,

1611
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
the one-pukarande,

1612
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the one-pukarande,

1613
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
the one-pukarande,

1614
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
the one-pukarande,

1615
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
the part and the...

1616
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Well, it means what I said before.

1617
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's only defined later.

1618
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So the commentator,

1619
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
the interpretation of those mind moments

1620
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
when you kind of want to

1621
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
and then you enter into the...

1622
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You enter the path,

1623
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
then you realize the fruit

1624
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
to the next moment.

1625
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's just a lot of nonsense.

1626
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
In the certain means.

1627
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And again,

1628
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
even that division came from the Buddha,

1629
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
from somebody who had such vision.

1630
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
But people might not know that,

1631
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
necessarily for themselves.

1632
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Or for others.

1633
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
When you inside the public,

1634
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
you can recognize an arahant.

1635
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
There is another sort,

1636
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I think,

1637
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I might mention before,

1638
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
but Venerable Badiya,

1639
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
wasn't it?

1640
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
The dwarf.

1641
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
You've been marked it.

1642
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Well, no, no.

1643
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You don't recognize it.

1644
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Yes.

1645
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
In Udanas,

1646
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
when Sariputra was teaching

1647
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
this monk,

1648
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
thinking he still had work to do.

1649
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But this monk was just sitting silently,

1650
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
just hearing whatever Sariputra was saying.

1651
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And then the Buddha saw the occasion

1652
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
and he said,

1653
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Oh, look at the occasion.

1654
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Venerable Sariputra

1655
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
is very diligently teaching

1656
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Venerable Badiya,

1657
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
not knowing the Venerable Badi

1658
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
is already an arahant.

1659
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So he actually didn't have any work

1660
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
to do any more.

1661
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But there wasn't a parent.

1662
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
In Suta,

1663
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
the clearly sweet one,

1664
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
that A8,

1665
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Pukaral,

1666
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
one Pukaral,

1667
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
one Pukaral,

1668
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
what does it mean?

1669
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Well, no.

1670
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's clearly written in terms of again,

1671
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
and it's clearly written

1672
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
that there are four stages of enlightenment.

1673
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
The Buddha talked about it.

1674
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Buddha said that

1675
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
there is a somebody,

1676
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
there is a difference,

1677
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
within somebody with a sort of partner,

1678
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
there is a difference

1679
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
between somebody who

1680
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
fully realized

1681
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
that he's a sort of partner.

1682
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And somebody who didn't quite yet realize

1683
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
that he is actually a sort of partner.

1684
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So in other words,

1685
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
you develop understanding

1686
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
of the four-nover truths, for example.

1687
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And you understood it.

1688
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But now the benefits of that understanding

1689
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
have not become a parent yet.

1690
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And that's the difference

1691
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
between the path and the fruit.

1692
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
For some people,

1693
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
they understood it

1694
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
and they understood it so hard

1695
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
that the benefits

1696
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
are pretty much immediate.

1697
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
For others,

1698
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
they are not.

1699
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
But what the Buddha said

1700
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
in relation to that,

1701
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
is that if somebody has,

1702
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
like in case of a sort of partner,

1703
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
somebody that is to the Dhamma,

1704
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
the benefits will

1705
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
have to be reached.

1706
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
If not before,

1707
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
then at the moment of its death.

1708
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And it's not nothing

1709
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
kind of magical or mystical,

1710
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
it simply means that

1711
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
nature understanding of the Dhamma

1712
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
basically goes through the nature of death

1713
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
and panic and falling apart

1714
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and losing aggregate.

1715
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So if you understood that,

1716
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
when those aggregates

1717
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
do start falling apart,

1718
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
you will fall apart

1719
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
through that understanding.

1720
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Because that's what you have understood.

1721
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Which is why,

1722
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
at the moment of death,

1723
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
the latest,

1724
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
you will get the benefits

1725
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
of your understanding.

1726
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And that's the same

1727
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
for any of the aggregates.

1728
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Whether it's a sort of partner

1729
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
and his fruit,

1730
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
circling, I mean,

1731
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
his fruit,

1732
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
orangami and his fruit,

1733
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
or oranghan,

1734
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
then his fruit.

1735
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
There is a career

1736
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
in between the

1737
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Anagami and oranghan.

1738
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
What's up over here?

1739
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
No, there isn't.

1740
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
No, there isn't a career line at all.

1741
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That's why there's that

1742
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
that suit them.

1743
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And those,

1744
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
all those monks came.

1745
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I don't know, hundreds of them.

1746
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And they all declared

1747
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
an orangish.

1748
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And somebody has the Buddha

1749
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
is that really the case?

1750
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And he said,

1751
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
some of them are truly

1752
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
arahans, but some of them

1753
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
overestimated themselves

1754
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
and they're still anagamis.

1755
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So, he didn't like,

1756
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
you know, they were not like

1757
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
putunjanas completely

1758
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
deluded thinking

1759
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
they're arahans.

1760
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
No, they were anagamis,

1761
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
thinking they were arahans.

1762
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Road Buddha

1763
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
but they couldn't.

1764
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
He could distinguish it.

1765
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah.

1766
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So, for road Buddha,

1767
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
there is a career line

1768
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
between Anagami and oranghan.

1769
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yes.

1770
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah, because he was

1771
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
the same Buddha.

1772
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Only he can.

1773
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Well, only he can,

1774
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
or sometimes people

1775
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
had the ability to see

1776
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
other people's minds,

1777
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
especially when they could see.

1778
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But there was, you know,

1779
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
random.

1780
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
There was not a guarantee.

1781
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So, that is a meaning

1782
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
of Aikukara.

1783
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It's basically,

1784
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
right, not career.

1785
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It's basically, as I said,

1786
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
it's one development.

1787
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That's why somebody

1788
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
can become an arahant

1789
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
in the first watch of the night.

1790
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But it doesn't mean,

1791
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
it's the same path

1792
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
they walk.

1793
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's just how fast

1794
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
they walk it.

1795
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And whether they stop

1796
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and the resting stops

1797
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
or not.

1798
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That's the difference.

1799
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But it's one path.

1800
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It's the same path.

1801
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It's not, like,

1802
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
trying to achieve

1803
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
four different things,

1804
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
or something like that.

1805
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And even those

1806
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
four different things

1807
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
are sometimes three different things.

1808
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
When he admitted

1809
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Sakyadagami

1810
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
from the descriptions.

1811
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Well, if you read

1812
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
in the San Yutani kaya

1813
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
part,

1814
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
but you think,

1815
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Sakyadagami means rebirth

1816
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
in pure bones.

1817
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But there is the whole chapter

1818
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
in San Yutani kaya

1819
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
of Adanagami's.

1820
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
There are, like,

1821
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
hundreds of

1822
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
different realms

1823
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
within the pure bones,

1824
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
whereby

1825
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
the Adanagami's

1826
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
would be reborn,

1827
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
depending on

1828
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
how big Adanagami's

1829
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
they were.

1830
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yeah.

1831
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So it's just like,

1832
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
it's, it's,

1833
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
well, it's kind of irrelevant

1834
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
in that sense.

1835
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It's relevant in a sense

1836
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
of abandoning the

1837
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
ten fetters.

1838
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And that's something

1839
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
something people can

1840
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
contemplate in practice

1841
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
in regard to.

1842
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
How far and what rebirth

1843
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
unless they're

1844
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
supernatural powers

1845
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
or unless you live

1846
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
with the Buddha

1847
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
or somebody like that,

1848
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
it will be a distraction.

1849
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And it's not,

1850
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
it's not,

1851
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
it's not directly related

1852
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
to the practice of Adanagami.

1853
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It can be an encouragement

1854
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
if it comes from,

1855
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
well, again,

1856
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
you don't need to have

1857
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
somebody now.

1858
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
If you read the sutras,

1859
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
you can see what the Buddha

1860
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
was saying in relation

1861
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
to people who were

1862
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
saying this, this, this,

1863
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
this.

1864
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And that can be an encouragement

1865
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
to the ten.

1866
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Mm-hmm.

1867
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Mm-hmm.

1868
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Mm-hmm.

1869
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I was to know that,

1870
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
what did you mean

1871
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
that you said that

1872
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
what I see

1873
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
bubble in the mind?

1874
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You said that

1875
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
that is a total sound,

1876
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
the total sight.

1877
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
What does it mean?

1878
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Or a total?

1879
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Five senses.

1880
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I don't know.

1881
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
For what they are

1882
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
because of your mind.

1883
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
They will meet

1884
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
in your mind.

1885
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Mm-hmm.

1886
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And because of that,

1887
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
the mind comes first,

1888
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
like the,

1889
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
is it the first verse

1890
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
of Dhammapada?

1891
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
The mind is the four-run,

1892
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
of all things.

1893
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So in other words,

1894
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
if you, like,

1895
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
if you have an object

1896
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
of your sight,

1897
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
again,

1898
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
if you look at a flux

1899
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
in front of you,

1900
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
see, you can't just

1901
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
have a pure sight.

1902
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Because even colors

1903
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
are distinguished

1904
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
as different colors.

1905
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
What is it?

1906
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Well, your eyes

1907
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
cannot distinguish.

1908
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Like, if your eyes

1909
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
would operate

1910
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
without your mind,

1911
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
well, it's inconceivable.

1912
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
You can't even think

1913
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
like that.

1914
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
In other words,

1915
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
when you look at the

1916
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
flask, there is already

1917
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
a significance

1918
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
implied in it.

1919
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
There is already a thought

1920
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
of flask.

1921
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Even if you know,

1922
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
don't know the name,

1923
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
don't know what it is.

1924
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
There is a thought

1925
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
of object being seen.

1926
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Mm-hmm.

1927
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And that's the sight.

1928
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Before, before you heard this,

1929
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
just up to the

1930
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
with consciousness,

1931
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
and this is a ton of object,

1932
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
the ninth and the sense of organ.

1933
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
With the help of consciousness,

1934
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
the contact arise.

1935
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Then the sight is called

1936
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
feeling.

1937
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
It's not correct.

1938
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
The perception means that

1939
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
this is perhaps.

1940
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah, perception means perception.

1941
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah.

1942
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You see it?

1943
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You don't feel your perception.

1944
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
You feel your feeling.

1945
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Feeling?

1946
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
No.

1947
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Oh, the supposition.

1948
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
There, you can be surprised.

1949
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
What kind of feeling?

1950
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Maybe nothing.

1951
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Maybe neutral feeling.

1952
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Yes.

1953
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
But if it's perhaps something,

1954
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I don't know,

1955
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
something very significant

1956
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
that some person gave you.

1957
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And if you look at that,

1958
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
then the feeling will arise.

1959
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So it doesn't always.

1960
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
That's the thing.

1961
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Like, feeling has its own domain.

1962
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Perception has its own domain.

1963
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
If you want to understand it correctly,

1964
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
you have to start applying that understanding

1965
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
to those domains correctly.

1966
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
In other words,

1967
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
if I ask you,

1968
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
how do you feel now?

1969
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
There has to be a feeling there.

1970
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And you can say,

1971
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
oh, I feel all right,

1972
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
which is a form of pleasure.

1973
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
You can say,

1974
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
well, I don't feel that well.

1975
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm a bit tired,

1976
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
which is a form of one pleasure.

1977
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
You can feel neutral.

1978
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And that situation,

1979
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
that general situation of

1980
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
you sitting here in this city,

1981
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
talking on Dhamma,

1982
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
that is already

1983
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
something that you are perceiving peripherally,

1984
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
in your thoughts.

1985
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It's present,

1986
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
because if I ask you,

1987
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
where are you now?

1988
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
You will immediately know where you are.

1989
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
You will have to stop and figure out.

1990
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Because it's already there,

1991
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
so you just have to access it with your attention.

1992
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Now, if you forget about that,

1993
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
which is where actually

1994
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
where it should start,

1995
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
the contemplation starts to start

1996
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
at the most general level you are capable of.

1997
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
But if you don't know that,

1998
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
then you will take a random object

1999
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and try to examine it

2000
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
on a scientific psychological

2001
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and then try to discover the nature of perception

2002
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and the nature of feeling.

2003
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
So I look at this thing in my hands.

2004
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
What do I feel?

2005
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Even if you get any understanding from that,

2006
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
it will be on the level of intellectual satisfaction.

2007
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Oh, yes, it makes sense.

2008
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But leaves the whole domain

2009
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
of feeling and perception

2010
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
on that general level,

2011
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
absolutely intact.

2012
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
So in other words,

2013
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
you have to start

2014
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
from the opposite direction.

2015
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So you have to think,

2016
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
you are here,

2017
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
away from home,

2018
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
in this city,

2019
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
talking about Dhamma.

2020
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Or you can define it,

2021
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
whichever way you are.

2022
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But that's your current situation.

2023
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Within that situation,

2024
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
there are objects around you.

2025
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Within those objects,

2026
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
they are more particular objects.

2027
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
They are more important objects.

2028
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
They are less important objects.

2029
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
They are more useful objects like that cushion.

2030
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
They are less useful objects like that being

2031
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
that you don't need at the moment.

2032
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And that's all within that experience

2033
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
as a whole of you being in this room

2034
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
sitting down and talking.

2035
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So that was the demandfulness

2036
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
of the body postures

2037
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
works on that level.

2038
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
If you are aware of your body posture,

2039
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
that's almost like the most general thing

2040
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
that determines your current situation.

2041
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And that situation is perceived,

2042
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
that situation is felt,

2043
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
that situation is intended.

2044
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
What's the technique at the...

2045
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And on the level of that situation

2046
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
is where the contact happens.

2047
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And only because you are already contacted,

2048
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
you can distinguish all these particular things

2049
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
around you with your eyes, ears, nose, and so on.

2050
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So in that general situation,

2051
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
is where the three meet.

2052
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
They don't meet like cause and effect

2053
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
as often the commenter is in terms of

2054
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
you have one hand, another hand,

2055
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
you have the sense organs

2056
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and the consciousness

2057
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
and the meat and the sound is the sound

2058
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
to whatever it was.

2059
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
No, the sound is the contact.

2060
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I forgot it.

2061
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But the point is...

2062
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
They don't meet like that.

2063
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Well, even the nature of meeting

2064
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
is timeless.

2065
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It does not involve time.

2066
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Clapping hands involve time.

2067
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
You can put it as simple as that.

2068
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Salayatana is part of the Patitson Pada.

2069
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Whatever is part of the Patitson Pada,

2070
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
she is the principal of the Patitson Pada,

2071
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
otherwise it wouldn't be included there.

2072
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So it means that conscious matter

2073
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
is already there.

2074
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And if things come in range

2075
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
as the Buddha said,

2076
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
the corresponding engagement occurs.

2077
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But it doesn't occur always.

2078
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So if things come in range,

2079
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
that can be the cause for the contact.

2080
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
But then also consciousness

2081
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and their working sense organs

2082
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
are a matter

2083
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
are required.

2084
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Because if something happens to them,

2085
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
there won't be any sight arising.

2086
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
There won't be any hearing

2087
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
or anything like that.

2088
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
If your ear organs are damaged

2089
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
or whatever, even while you're still alive,

2090
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
that's it.

2091
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
They'll stop working.

2092
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Would there be any explanation there

2093
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
about the lambda and coma?

2094
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well, like,

2095
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the Buddha did refer to a thing called

2096
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
the Ayusankara,

2097
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
that upon which life depends,

2098
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
like vitality.

2099
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So sometimes you can be brained

2100
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
that the body can be almost

2101
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
completely dysfunctional

2102
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
but not quite.

2103
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And for as long as it's not quite,

2104
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
there might be still some vitality,

2105
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
vitality left in the body,

2106
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
in which case,

2107
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
people wake up from the coma

2108
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
or something like that.

2109
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
But sometimes they just don't.

2110
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Well, there is a state of cessation

2111
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
and perception and feeling,

2112
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
where breathing stops

2113
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
in meditation.

2114
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
You're just the ultimate

2115
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
form of development of your mind,

2116
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
whereby, like,

2117
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
you don't even breathe.

2118
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
That's it.

2119
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
The man,

2120
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
when her ex,

2121
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
when her husband came to visit her

2122
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and she thought he became

2123
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
sort of one,

2124
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
and he asked what's the difference

2125
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
between somebody who is dead

2126
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
and somebody who is

2127
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
cessation and perception of feeling.

2128
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Instead, the difference is that the one

2129
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
who is sensation and perception of feeling

2130
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
still has his life vitality left.

2131
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
So he returns.

2132
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,360
on the level of metaphysics, but yeah, the relationship

2133
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,880
between consciousness and body is external.

2134
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,520
Conscious is not internal in the body.

2135
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,640
And I think the Buddha compared in the suitors

2136
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,080
like a gem.

2137
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:35,520
And if there is a thread running clearly through the gem,

2138
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,720
that's like conscious body.

2139
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,400
But there are completely two different things.

2140
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,640
Thread is not part of the gem.

2141
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,840
Gem is not part of the thread.

2142
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,080
It's entrapped in the gem.

2143
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,000
And that's what Yenavira referred to it, actually.

2144
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,500
Yeah.

2145
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,960
He didn't say that body and consciousness

2146
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:50,880
are superimposed.

2147
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,120
He said they're jacks to post.

2148
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,480
Means they're completely indifferent to each other.

2149
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:59,400
He's just an occurrence of them coming together,

2150
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,120
but not merging together.

2151
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,120
They come together.

2152
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,200
And as a result of that overlap,

2153
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,600
you get Nama Rupa, which you can designate.

2154
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,600
So you can ever directly access matter.

2155
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,880
Nor can you ever directly access consciousness.

2156
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,800
You can abandon matter by fully understanding it.

2157
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,760
Sorry.

2158
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,360
By fully understanding consciousness,

2159
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:27,360
you remove the footing for the matter.

2160
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,240
In other words, you stop misunderstanding

2161
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,600
that overlap of conscious body.

2162
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,920
But well, it helped me.

2163
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,120
And I think it's probably more happened because everybody,

2164
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:44,240
but they fault assumes consciousnesses inside

2165
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,960
and everything else is external.

2166
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,360
And I did actually remember that I didn't

2167
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,840
make much out of it at the time.

2168
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,440
But when I was reading existential philosophy

2169
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,400
such and they were talking in terms of things

2170
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,120
were being, like, not things are conscious

2171
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,400
in terms of the dead matter has consciousness in it.

2172
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,160
But no, their consciousness is out there with the things,

2173
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:07,920
not in them.

2174
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,760
In other words, that's why you have six types of consciousness

2175
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,880
because you have six senses.

2176
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,480
Every sense, the sun's things are there.

2177
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,000
And the only reason it can be sun is because consciousness

2178
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,160
is there with those things.

2179
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,320
So the conscious matter.

2180
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,280
And then if there is ignorance present,

2181
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,400
when that contact arises, well, the contact will arise

2182
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,560
as a result of you feeling conflicted.

2183
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:46,840
So if you appropriate the contact, then you're contacted.

2184
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,480
So contact always pertains to sense of self.

2185
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,200
But if you see that thing out there already

2186
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,120
a reason the conscious matter means, oh,

2187
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,040
you can't do anything about it.

2188
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,000
You can't prevent consciousness from disassociating

2189
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,840
from the matter if it decides to do that.

2190
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,400
Which is, I think what happens when sometimes people

2191
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,520
lose their mind and they go cut-atonic.

2192
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,800
They go completely like dead motionless.

2193
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,000
Nor can you prevent that matter to be destroyed.

2194
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,360
You absolutely know.

2195
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,880
You can't even conceive having say in it.

2196
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,280
It's just beyond your range.

2197
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,040
Yet your entire life depends upon it.

2198
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,600
So that's the parallel situation.

2199
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,160
So if you realize that your consciousness

2200
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,640
is as external as this matter that you see

2201
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,720
and you have no say in it, then it ceases to be yours.

2202
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:45,120
And then when corresponding engagement occurs,

2203
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,200
you see that occurring as a result of things

2204
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,640
that you have no say in it.

2205
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,800
Therefore, whatever occurs on their account,

2206
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,520
you have no say in that either.

2207
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,760
It's not yours.

2208
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,680
Near this experience, how old is it?

2209
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,200
Some people have seen that they are the body either.

2210
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,120
Well, I don't know.

2211
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,840
Yeah, hard to say really.

2212
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,080
It's quite early.

2213
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:10,760
I'm sure something happens, but people use words differently.

2214
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,120
They say they saw their body.

2215
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,240
But without any ice, how old is it?

2216
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,760
Yeah, I see that's the thing.

2217
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,760
Some people.

2218
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,760
I don't know.

2219
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,840
As I say, it's hard to know what people mean

2220
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,040
when they describe these things.

2221
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,080
Because they might use certain words.

2222
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,640
They would mean something for you, something else for them.

2223
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,800
So they would say, oh, I saw my body.

2224
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,000
You might have well been a thought of their body,

2225
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,080
a thought of them abandoning the body.

2226
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:43,440
But because it was a real life and death experience,

2227
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,400
that thought was very significant.

2228
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,600
It was so real as they would usually describe it.

2229
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,440
It was as real as if I was looking at my body over there.

2230
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:59,640
It can be that, or who knows, really.

2231
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,120
I mean, when people even try to explain mundane things,

2232
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,080
often misunderstanding happens.

2233
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,640
Because you realize they're using the same words you know,

2234
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,920
but completely differently.

2235
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,120
They meant something completely different.

2236
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,600
Imagine when you try to explain such personal things

2237
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,880
or when people try to talk about spiritual thoughts

2238
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,600
or whatever else, and you get all like, well,

2239
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,800
you can't make sense out of it.

2240
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,400
Because what it means for them doesn't necessarily

2241
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,160
mean other things to others.

2242
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,040
But that's exactly why the Buddha did

2243
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,120
refer to the miracle of teaching.

2244
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,600
He said, if a person understood the Dharma,

2245
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,880
he's able to convey that to another.

2246
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,360
And then they understand it.

2247
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,000
That's what that equals a miracle.

2248
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Why?

2249
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,120
Because the Dharma is so personal, the sense of self,

2250
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:54,520
the senses and everything, that there is no way

2251
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,880
that when I say something in regard to senses,

2252
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,960
another person will think exactly the same thing,

2253
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,120
unless we're both aren't, so something like that.

2254
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,280
Because it's so personal that the meaning of it

2255
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,880
is so personal.

2256
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,160
So it really needs to be, you need to dig through it

2257
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,360
and see what it's meant.

2258
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,440
That, I think a mother said before, again,

2259
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,760
it's like, when I said, you can just take these five aggregates,

2260
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,640
poly terms, Rupa, Vedana, Sainas and Karavinyana,

2261
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:26,080
and just take the English words, or Japanese words for them.

2262
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,920
And think about it, and see how much we do,

2263
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,640
you actually understand.

2264
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,120
How do I remember when I was reading the sutras

2265
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,000
and then the consciousness?

2266
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,800
And you just read all your consciousness.

2267
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,800
But then the spot wants to think, well,

2268
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,600
OK, forget about it, Pali.

2269
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,160
Forget about the sutras.

2270
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,720
Just use the word consciousness that I think I know.

2271
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,080
What is it?

2272
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,200
What, like, when I say consciousness,

2273
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,440
what is that that this designation consciousness

2274
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,960
stands for in my experience?

2275
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,200
What is it?

2276
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,800
And then you realize, OK, consciousness is very hard.

2277
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,520
Why don't I start with easy matter?

2278
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,880
And then you start, and then you realize that's equally hard.

2279
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,440
So what is that matter then?

2280
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,560
And you realize, if you were to fully understand

2281
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,360
these five designations, you would be an adult.

2282
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,160
Because there is no difference between intellectual understanding

2283
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,000
or real understanding.

2284
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,600
Understanding is understanding.

2285
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,920
You can start intellectually or non-intellectually,

2286
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,560
but understanding that it's the same arrival.

2287
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,600
So you might start pondering about it.

2288
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,520
And as long as you're not doing, like,

2289
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,280
scholastic comparison between the words and the truth,

2290
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,280
if you're really trying to see what designation consciousness

2291
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,760
stands in your experience, that's when the sutras,

2292
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,160
if you read something, they say, think twice.

2293
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,800
When they say, first-genre, first-genre, what is first-genre?

2294
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,160
Or they say something else, they repeat it twice.

2295
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,080
That's basically the way you're bringing it to the mind.

2296
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,680
And then to see that, that you just brought to your mind

2297
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,960
in your experience, for what it stands for.

2298
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,760
Not just kind of an example, it's called an explain it,

2299
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,920
or draw the parallel to the drawing or whatever, a scheme.

2300
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,200
But they really understand, if consciousness, consciousness,

2301
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:17,720
that I just said, what is that, what I said?

2302
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,640
What is it that this saying stands for?

2303
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,120
What is that?

2304
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,320
What did I just designate in my experience

2305
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,600
when I said feeling?

2306
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,600
What is feeling now that I said it?

2307
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,520
And the fact that you said feeling means it stands for something.

2308
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,320
It designates something.

2309
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,640
So you really have to push as hard as far as you need to

2310
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:44,160
until same feeling stands for that which feeling really is,

2311
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,120
not for your idea of what feeling is,

2312
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,080
or for your misunderstanding of what feeling is.

2313
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:55,000
And you can see how many people have not understood this

2314
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,160
by seeing how many people cannot distinguish between what they perceive

2315
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,320
and what they feel, or what they intend.

2316
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:08,160
And it's all like a jungle, just everything and everything.

2317
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,400
Is it that I remember that you sent me

2318
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,560
that I can know some meditation something,

2319
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,080
you are a disciple, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord.

2320
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,680
No, that was Dukka, on Dukka.

2321
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,400
It was written that the difference,

2322
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,840
the perception, the difference between the Dara and the Puduceno

2323
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,280
is the Arahat and when you see the chair, he doesn't think it is his.

2324
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,960
But Puduceno thinks it is his chair.

2325
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,000
Only that is a difference, is it true?

2326
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Well, it's slightly subtler than that.

2327
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,480
He might not think that's my chair,

2328
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,800
because if it's his chair, I won't think it's my chair.

2329
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,080
But I can think that chair is for me to sit on.

2330
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:48,840
For me?

2331
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,080
Yeah.

2332
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,040
Not in the market.

2333
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,760
It's for me to sit on.

2334
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,960
Like the chair, the significance of the chair, is for sitting.

2335
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,920
It's to be sat on.

2336
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,720
And that doesn't necessarily mean sense of self.

2337
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,880
But when somebody who holds sense of self and self,

2338
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:13,880
you approaches it, he will inevitably take it like that.

2339
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:18,480
So when a Puduceno sees a chair or any other sign,

2340
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:24,680
a cup to drink water from, it will be a cup is for my eye

2341
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,360
to drink water from.

2342
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,320
It's for me to drink water from.

2343
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,360
The chair is for me to sit on.

2344
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,400
And that's already a sense of self.

2345
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,520
For me?

2346
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,360
The Puduceno sees the opposite, the river.

2347
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,120
Oh, what's happening?

2348
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,040
I never think that it's my river.

2349
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,560
That's fine.

2350
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,440
But as I said, seeing the river outside,

2351
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:52,200
it's only a particular object within the general situation

2352
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,360
that you're in.

2353
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,440
And yourself is on the general level.

2354
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,440
You'll never see your sense of self on the level

2355
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,120
where you're seeing.

2356
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,720
Your sense of self is in that peripheral situation

2357
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,680
that determines everything particular that's

2358
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,640
right in front of you.

2359
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,640
That's why people never can ever understand an atom

2360
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,400
and they go about.

2361
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,360
And, oh, that's not real.

2362
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,200
That doesn't exist.

2363
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,440
See, it's so constantly changing.

2364
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,280
I just destroyed it.

2365
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,840
It means it's impermanent.

2366
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,520
Those are all objects of your senses.

2367
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,480
And your sense of self is way deeper than that.

2368
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,880
It's on the level of that situation I was telling you about.

2369
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,360
Yeah.

2370
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:27,880
Oh, yeah.

2371
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:31,640
So you are standing here from which position

2372
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:34,120
you can see the river out there.

2373
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:38,560
That's already something you perceive as one thing.

2374
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,720
That's one thing.

2375
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:43,160
Very general thing.

2376
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,720
And your sense of self is on that level.

2377
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,080
And that's where it has to be understood.

2378
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,280
So if you look at the river out there

2379
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,000
and start looking at your sense of self there,

2380
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:00,360
then you already forgot half of the image.

2381
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:06,080
What does it mean that you said that because of sense of self,

2382
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,080
I think that there is a front contact feeling, right?

2383
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,120
The next perception reason, next method formation.

2384
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,600
I see this process because of sense of self.

2385
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,520
What does it mean?

2386
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,160
Otherwise, it doesn't think for contact.

2387
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,000
Well, that process, as I said before,

2388
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,080
it's not really a process like that.

2389
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,320
It's all simultaneous.

2390
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,360
So you can't think one, two, three, four, five,

2391
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,400
occurring one after the other.

2392
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:35,880
When ignorance, there is contact.

2393
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,440
When ignorance, contact.

2394
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,280
That's all you can say.

2395
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,960
If the contact is manifest,

2396
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,920
means ignorance is present there, right there and there.

2397
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,920
For as long as contact is being manifested.

2398
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,960
Contact, you mean that the...

2399
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,160
Meaning being touched by things.

2400
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,400
Before and they have contact.

2401
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,760
No, they don't have ignorance.

2402
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,920
So there is nothing to be contacted.

2403
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,600
Contact about what do you mean by contact?

2404
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,280
Being touched.

2405
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,280
Means having...

2406
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,880
Expaling your objects in the sense of the...

2407
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,160
No, not necessarily, no.

2408
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,160
Not necessarily.

2409
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,160
As you see, you can be very indifferent to the external objects.

2410
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,480
Care about the flask, I can care about the river.

2411
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,080
I can care about anything.

2412
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,880
But you can still be able to do that.

2413
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,960
Yeah, aren't they have experience?

2414
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,400
Well, no, I don't, they haven't done everything properly

2415
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,200
on the level of that situation.

2416
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,680
In other words, if you are not,

2417
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,200
if there is no sense of self

2418
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,240
on the most general level

2419
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,640
of Michael sitting in a cave with him,

2420
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:42,000
leaning on the cushion, talking about it down,

2421
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,960
that's one experience, very general.

2422
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,760
And you can define it as far as you want.

2423
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,640
It still remains one experience

2424
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,960
as a whole, general.

2425
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,960
If you abandon that,

2426
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,920
then whatever comes in front of you,

2427
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,520
particularly,

2428
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,840
pleasing with this pleasing,

2429
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,000
or neutral, or extremely pleasing,

2430
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,800
or extremely pleasing, or neutral,

2431
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,360
you won't be moved by it, why?

2432
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,480
Because you abandon its foundations.

2433
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:16,400
And the foundations is the situation as a whole.

2434
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,720
But if you keep chasing after particular objects,

2435
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,240
you're not seeing the bigger picture,

2436
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:25,560
and that's where the problem is.

2437
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,360
I abandon you now, or what do you mean by that?

2438
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:32,960
Full understanding, not regarding his ears.

2439
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,680
OK, let's try it this.

2440
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,160
Michael, in the cave, it's not easy.

2441
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,280
It's not easy to understand.

2442
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,320
So you don't have to, yeah, you don't have to worry about it.

2443
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,160
Well, maybe a little bit,

2444
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,800
because it can keep you going, but

2445
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,240
Michael, in the cave,

2446
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:52,240
living in a cushion, talking about the dharma.

2447
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,240
That's a thought,

2448
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,240
but not just a thought.

2449
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:59,240
That's a thought that stands for your actual experience right now,

2450
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,240
which means it's a very general experience,

2451
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,240
very real as such.

2452
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,240
And that's your situation,

2453
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,240
and you can stop there now,

2454
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,240
because that situation remains unchanged.

2455
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,240
Whether we talk quickly, or slowly,

2456
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,240
or stop talking for a moment,

2457
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,240
it's still Michael in the cave,

2458
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,240
living in a cushion, talking about the dharma.

2459
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,240
So in that sense, it's independent of the particular.

2460
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,240
So even if you move the cushion,

2461
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,240
if you're not living on the cushion,

2462
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,240
it's still generally Michael in the cave.

2463
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,240
Within Michael sitting in the cave,

2464
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:36,240
she leans on the cushion, sits on the floor,

2465
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:39,240
and then within that, she talks the dharma.

2466
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,240
She might stop talking about dharma,

2467
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,240
she's still living on the cushion,

2468
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,240
sitting on the floor in the cave.

2469
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,240
She might stand up, stop leaning on the cushion.

2470
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,240
She's still in the cave.

2471
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:53,240
So that's how it's hierarchically ordered.

2472
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,240
So you don't have to understand all of it.

2473
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,240
You can take one of those levels,

2474
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,240
which is the body posture.

2475
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,240
I'm being seated right now.

2476
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:06,240
That's a general thought that stands for your actual body posture.

2477
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,240
And you can establish your mindfulness upon that.

2478
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,240
Now see, the thing is,

2479
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:17,240
Michael in the cave sitting in the floor talking dharma

2480
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:21,240
is the fundamental situation you're in.

2481
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,240
But if you look at it,

2482
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:29,240
would it be possible for you to sit in this cave

2483
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,240
that you can see now,

2484
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:34,240
if there is no cave here,

2485
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,240
or if somebody destroys it?

2486
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,240
Would it be possible for you to sit on the floor

2487
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:44,240
or lean on the cushion if I take the cushion?

2488
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,240
It wouldn't.

2489
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:48,240
So you realize that these objects of your senses,

2490
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,240
things you can actually see and hear and touch,

2491
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,240
in that indirect manner, not directly,

2492
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,240
like this is not mine, this is not mine.

2493
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,240
But in that indirect manner,

2494
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,240
they indicate that that situation as a whole,

2495
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:06,240
the general mindful picture, is not independent.

2496
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,240
It depends upon these very particular objects.

2497
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,240
Because if they're removed,

2498
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,240
at any point,

2499
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,240
this general situation cannot remain standing.

2500
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:19,240
And the utmost general situation is your body.

2501
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:23,240
The whole world is within your body.

2502
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,240
And if your body is removed,

2503
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,240
your whole world goes.

2504
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,240
It's the same principle.

2505
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,240
So if the body goes,

2506
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,240
the one you can see,

2507
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,240
you can see in the mirror,

2508
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,240
like you can see in others.

2509
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,240
If that's taken,

2510
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,240
none of the general situation,

2511
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,240
none of the most lofty feelings or thoughts

2512
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,240
can remain standing.

2513
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,240
So that's the relationship

2514
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,240
with peripheral and actual understanding

2515
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,240
about the needs to be understood.

2516
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,240
Because that's how it works.

2517
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:57,240
If you forget about the peripheral,

2518
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,240
general,

2519
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:01,240
you just end up chasing these particular objects.

2520
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
But you're not seeing them correctly.

2521
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,240
You don't see them as mutually determined

2522
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,240
in the general situation.

2523
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,240
You just see them in a very linear manner,

2524
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,240
which is on the level of science,

2525
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,240
scholastics,

2526
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
or I don't know,

2527
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,240
medicine,

2528
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,240
any form of like natural psychology,

2529
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,240
all of that is just linear observation.

2530
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,240
But it doesn't reveal the timeless principle

2531
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,240
of mutual dependence.

2532
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:31,240
But it's no better.

2533
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,240
Because for as long as the case is present,

2534
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,240
your situation of being in the cave

2535
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,240
can be maintained.

2536
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,240
But then vice versa.

2537
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,240
If there was no intention for you

2538
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,240
to be in the cave in the first place,

2539
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,240
this particular cave you see,

2540
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,240
you wouldn't have come here,

2541
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:49,240
therefore you wouldn't have seen it.

2542
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,240
So as much as the particular things,

2543
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,240
determine your general situation,

2544
01:29:54,240 --> 01:30:00,240
general situation defines the particular things.

2545
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,240
So in terms of the practice of mindfulness,

2546
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,240
works along those levels.

2547
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,240
If you have a thought,

2548
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,240
no matter how distant,

2549
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,240
but even a little bit present,

2550
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,240
in the back of your mind,

2551
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,240
that you are in this cave.

2552
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,240
If that's established as an anchor,

2553
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,240
what I said before,

2554
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,240
whatever you do,

2555
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,240
while you are in the cave,

2556
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,240
you'll be mindful of that.

2557
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,240
Without having to trace

2558
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,240
every particular thing you do

2559
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:31,240
while you are in the cave.

2560
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,240
Or you can anchor yourself in

2561
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,240
being seated on the floor.

2562
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,240
Whatever you do,

2563
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,240
whatever you think,

2564
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,240
whatever you say,

2565
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,240
while you remain seated on the floor,

2566
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,240
if you are established upon the thought

2567
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,240
of being seated on the floor,

2568
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,240
you'll be mindful of whatever you do.

2569
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,240
Because mindfulness is about

2570
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,240
not chasing these particular things,

2571
01:30:53,240 --> 01:31:04,240
but being established in regard to them.

2572
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,240
And it's already seen as dependent.

2573
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,240
Well, you don't have to like

2574
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,240
strain yourself in terms of always seeing it

2575
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,240
because it's already there.

2576
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,240
You just have to remember

2577
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,240
and step back into it.

2578
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,240
Because your situation of sitting on the floor

2579
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,240
in the cave is already there

2580
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,240
and it's still there.

2581
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,240
And even if you stop thinking about it,

2582
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,240
it's still there.

2583
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,240
Because the body is still in that situation.

2584
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:31,240
That's why you can reestablish mindfulness.

2585
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,240
And the more skilled you become,

2586
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,240
the quicker you reestablish it.

2587
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,240
The more skilled you become

2588
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:40,240
in recognizing the things

2589
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:43,240
that you can use to establish your mindfulness on.

2590
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,240
And that's a very different

2591
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,240
type of practice than what you get.

2592
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,240
The Bermis retreat centers,

2593
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,240
when you're all about focusing and staring

2594
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,240
and observing and trying to catch

2595
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,240
the particular moment.

2596
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:05,240
That's as mindful as you can get.

2597
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,240
And you end up forcing yourself into that,

2598
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,240
more and more,

2599
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,240
which is why all those people

2600
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:14,240
get very intense.

2601
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,240
Yeah.

2602
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:21,240
So, it means that you don't need to worry so much

2603
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,240
and what's feeling or what's the perception or what is the feeling.

2604
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,240
Well, that's the thing.

2605
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:27,240
Like, you can if you choose that as an approach,

2606
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,240
but you don't have to understand everything

2607
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,240
at once all the time.

2608
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:34,240
You need to develop mindfulness

2609
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,240
to the extent necessary

2610
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,240
when understanding is developed

2611
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,240
to a sufficient degree where

2612
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:44,240
you don't take things to be yours anymore.

2613
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,240
It doesn't mean that you actually have to go around destroying things

2614
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,240
or giving things up.

2615
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,240
I octane this because it's not mine.

2616
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,240
It wasn't you able to begin with.

2617
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:56,240
So, how can you even give it away?

2618
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,240
So, and again, you can be mindful in regard

2619
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:06,240
to any of the feeling, perception or intentions

2620
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,240
through this form of mindfulness.

2621
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,240
So, if you're mindful,

2622
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,240
sitting of your situation and your body posture,

2623
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,240
and then feeling arises

2624
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:18,240
while you're seated in the cave.

2625
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,240
It's your mindful in regard to that.

2626
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:23,240
Oh, you can choose feeling to be

2627
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,240
the anchor of your mindfulness.

2628
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,240
You say, I'm feeling this way now.

2629
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:31,240
While I feel like that through that,

2630
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,240
I'm feeling this, through that, I'm feeling that.

2631
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,240
And that's why in Anapurna Satisood

2632
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,240
the Buddha said, when he was talking about

2633
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,240
the development of mindfulness, he said,

2634
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,240
while breathing in like this,

2635
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,240
I feel like that.

2636
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:48,240
While breathing in like that,

2637
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,240
I'll observe my whole body.

2638
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,240
While breathing in, breathing out,

2639
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,240
breathing in, breathing both,

2640
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,240
I will experience my body in this way.

2641
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,240
I will feel this.

2642
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,240
I will feel pleasure.

2643
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,240
So, you actually do it rightly.

2644
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,240
By doing it rightly,

2645
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,240
you end up recognizing it rightly.

2646
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,240
And that's why it brings the

2647
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:11,240
force of the pathanas to complete

2648
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:13,240
fulfillment in regard to body,

2649
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,240
in regard to feeling, in regard to thoughts,

2650
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,240
in regard to mind, in regard to mind,

2651
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:20,240
in regard to thoughts.

2652
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:26,240
So, you can do it actively,

2653
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,240
you can do it passively.

2654
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,240
Like while I'm seated right here,

2655
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,240
breathing, I'm going to be thinking this.

2656
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,240
Oh, while I'm seated here breathing,

2657
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:41,240
these thoughts are arising.

2658
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,240
That's passive.

2659
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,240
You know they're actually actively thinking,

2660
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:47,240
but you're just recognizing what your mind does.

2661
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:54,240
I was practicing this as a director,

2662
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,240
whatever I think the mind,

2663
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,240
any kind of thought.

2664
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,240
Any kind of thought.

2665
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:06,240
Just see the...

2666
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,240
Not mind means it for everything is appearing on their own standards.

2667
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,240
Yeah, but the thing is,

2668
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:14,240
you have to know what not mind is,

2669
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:17,240
in order to be able to see particular things

2670
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:20,240
as they arise, as not mind.

2671
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:23,240
So, first the right view needs to be developed,

2672
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,240
in order to be applied.

2673
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,240
So, when I said that,

2674
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,240
the nobody's argument should be contemplating,

2675
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:35,240
this is not mind, not for me, not I am.

2676
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,240
Not myself, and you should...

2677
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,240
That requires the right view.

2678
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,240
You won't work otherwise.

2679
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,240
Everything is appearing on their own.

2680
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,240
Is it not in the...

2681
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,240
Well, it is, but the thing is,

2682
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,240
when you're like,

2683
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,240
whatever arises,

2684
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,240
and then you regard it as not mind,

2685
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:55,240
it's almost like a form of management for a pathogen.

2686
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:58,240
You need to think to arise first,

2687
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,240
and then you can...

2688
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,240
Oh, this is not mind.

2689
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,240
But actually,

2690
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:06,240
you don't want to think to arise as yours to begin with.

2691
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:10,240
You don't want to have to do anything.

2692
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,240
That's what freedom means.

2693
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,240
That's what I don't lay down his burden,

2694
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,240
done his work,

2695
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:19,240
in every conceivable regard.

2696
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,240
There is no shoot for him anymore, in any way.

2697
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:28,240
So if your practice is about doing things when this arises,

2698
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,240
that requires that thing to keep arising.

2699
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:35,240
So you want to start focusing on your practice,

2700
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:38,240
taking you to a place whereby

2701
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:42,240
arising things won't require you to do anything anymore.

2702
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,240
In other words,

2703
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,240
when they will not arise as yourself,

2704
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,240
because the only reason you can...

2705
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,240
Well, the only reason you have to

2706
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,240
be saying to whatever arises,

2707
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,240
this is not mind,

2708
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:56,240
is because you first took his yours,

2709
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:59,240
and then you say it's not mind.

2710
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,240
So you want to stop taking it as yours,

2711
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:05,240
and then you can stop saying it's not mind.

2712
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:09,240
Because now it's true, it's not mind.

2713
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,240
And again,

2714
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,240
that's the difference between this general peripheral situation

2715
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,240
you're in,

2716
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:18,240
while you're looking at these particular things.

2717
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:23,240
Do you take things as yours on this general level?

2718
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:30,240
Well, that's what a sense of self is.

2719
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,240
So then trying to address the particular things

2720
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,240
that arise at you,

2721
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,240
as not me, not mind,

2722
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:36,240
actually leaves.

2723
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,240
If you don't see the connection

2724
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,240
between the particular,

2725
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:41,240
determining the general,

2726
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:45,240
and general defining the particular in return,

2727
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,240
your application of not mind, not me,

2728
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:52,240
won't work, just doesn't apply to anything.

2729
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,240
But if you see that,

2730
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:59,240
if I regard these particular things as not belonging to me,

2731
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:02,240
while I see those particular things determining

2732
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:04,240
this sense of me,

2733
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:07,240
well, that's a different story then.

2734
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,240
But that can only be done if you're fully aware

2735
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,240
of the situation as it has a reason,

2736
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,240
if the mindfulness is developed

2737
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,240
in a sufficient extent,

2738
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,240
to be aware of the situation

2739
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:21,240
while the particular things are coming and going.

2740
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:25,240
And then it can work.

2741
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:35,240
Something that the mindfulness of body

2742
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,240
or whatever,

2743
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,240
something gets lost.

2744
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:43,240
Like, it happens even for earlier.

2745
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,240
It's just because you put it generally.

2746
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,240
It happens.

2747
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:48,240
Well, like,

2748
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:54,240
for earlier, less and less,

2749
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:59,240
and for an other hand,

2750
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:02,240
forgetting things,

2751
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,240
forgetting particular things,

2752
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:08,240
does not induce ignorance anymore.

2753
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,240
So when you forget something,

2754
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,240
then you remember it.

2755
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,240
There was no ignorance induced in you,

2756
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,240
forgetting.

2757
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,240
No sense of self-induced,

2758
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,240
no appropriation induced,

2759
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:22,240
no pedan induced.

2760
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,240
For putugina, that's not the case.

2761
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,240
When putugina forgets,

2762
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,240
his habits,

2763
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,240
when he's in the state of forgetfulness,

2764
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,240
are habits of putugina,

2765
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:35,240
are habits that maintain a Vija

2766
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,240
and everything else.

2767
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:40,240
So that's why,

2768
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:42,240
that you cannot possibly be

2769
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,240
100% mindful all the time.

2770
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,240
It doesn't work like that.

2771
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,240
What you want to do is try to be mindful

2772
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:51,240
as much as you can,

2773
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,240
and while you're mindful,

2774
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:53,240
understand the things.

2775
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,240
And then when you forget,

2776
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:59,240
like when Adahans,

2777
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,240
or even Adahs,

2778
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,240
when they were,

2779
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,240
when they were around

2780
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:09,880
I was still a sort of runner, and when Sari put a diet, he was very shaken, he was very

2781
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:14,960
effective, but he said, everything went black, and the clouds were dark, and I couldn't

2782
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,760
... 20 years I've been serving the Lord and listening to the devil and I couldn't remember

2783
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:19,760
a single thing.

2784
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:23,840
But it doesn't mean that he stopped being a sort of runner.

2785
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:30,960
Means when whatever the pressing circumstances were gone, things were back to normal or

2786
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:43,960
earlier.

2787
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:49,360
When the sense of self is, when you are reflecting, when you are thinking, whether

2788
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:55,680
mindfully or not, there is an implication of me, that's the sense of self.

2789
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:02,800
And that's what I meant.

2790
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:09,360
When he might be forgetful in regard to things, that doesn't imply a sense of self anymore,

2791
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:17,040
because self and the whole appropriation thing is not in the things, it's in a relationship

2792
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:21,160
with the things, which means there is always a degree of awareness in that.

2793
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:28,560
So forgetfulness is in regard to particular things, but forgetfulness as an experience is

2794
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:38,000
something you can be mindful of, it's present, and it's something you don't have to forget.

2795
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,800
And on that level is the level where the sense of self arises.

2796
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:46,920
So that's why even when the act of forgetting does not adhere to the ignorance of the sense

2797
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:51,040
of self anymore, that's when you know that mindfulness is being developed.

2798
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,920
And you can afford to forget particular things, but obviously you forget less and less

2799
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:01,880
of the nature of things, and generally you remember what better if the mindfulness is

2800
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:05,520
developed, because that's how memory works.

2801
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:12,480
And as I said, if you remember, if you remember that you are here in this cave, if you don't

2802
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:18,120
forget that, whatever you're doing on account that you've been in the cave, you can be mindful

2803
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:21,400
in regard to that.

2804
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:25,280
Then you forget that you're in the cave, but the things you're still in the cave, then

2805
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,480
you can remember that you're in the cave, and you're establishing mindfulness, obviously

2806
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,280
a situation.

2807
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:33,040
But I don't mean that now you just have to keep thinking I'm in the cave, I'm in the

2808
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,040
cave.

2809
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:38,560
Now the point of mindfulness is to recognize this relationship between peripheral and

2810
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,040
actual, between general and particular.

2811
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:46,240
So you're mindful in the cave, that's it.

2812
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:52,720
Now through that mindfulness, while you're in the cave, do things.

2813
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:57,320
Talk, sit, walk, whatever, well, you will be doing inevitably something, even if it's

2814
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:02,440
nothing, I'm just sitting, well, that's something you're doing while you're in the cave.

2815
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,280
And that's mindfulness.

2816
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:11,720
And that's how the memory works, and if you read the sutras, that's why they always,

2817
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:16,880
when whoever would be related to the sutra, well, when they were on under the sutras, they

2818
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,680
said, that's a habit.

2819
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:23,240
On one occasion, the Lord was staying in this province.

2820
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:28,240
While he was staying in that occasion, in this province, he visited this forest.

2821
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:32,240
While he was staying in that province, visited this forest, he was sitting under the root

2822
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,560
of tree.

2823
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:39,240
While he was in the province, in that forest, under the root of the tree, these people came

2824
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:40,640
to visit.

2825
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:45,000
So it's situation within, situation within, situation within, situation within, situation

2826
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
within, and that's infinite.

2827
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
There's none to it.

2828
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:53,160
You can go as particular as you can observe, and as general as you can hold.

2829
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:56,320
The point is not to kind of find the beginning with the end of it.

2830
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:02,160
The point is to fully understand the relationship between more general and then more particular,

2831
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,560
because that's how mindfulness is established.

2832
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:10,320
So you don't have to necessarily start, oh, I mean, this province, in this forest, under

2833
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:15,880
this tree, you can just start with the body posture, because it would be implied.

2834
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:21,720
Well, you can just, while I'm under the root, while I'm under this tree, under the

2835
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:25,920
root of the tree, these people came to visit.

2836
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,360
While I'm still seated, under the root of this tree, we were talking about this.

2837
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:33,960
While I'm seated, under the tree, and we were talking about this, they asked me this

2838
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:34,960
particular question.

2839
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,720
Within that question, I gave this particular answer, and you end up remembering the whole

2840
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:45,280
thing, as opposed to linearly trying to list and just hold everything in mind at the same

2841
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,280
time.

2842
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,280
It doesn't work like that.

2843
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,480
And that's how sometimes there is a, like, the establishment of mind in the suitors

2844
01:44:52,480 --> 01:45:01,440
when they would have said the monk goes off and lives in the forest, and then he observes

2845
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:09,160
while in this forest, any perceptions and feelings, disturbances, based on the perceptions

2846
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:15,760
of the village, cannot arise, because I'm in the forest.

2847
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:21,920
So then he sets his mind like that, establishes it upon the perceptions of the forest.

2848
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:29,400
So in the morning, when he goes to the village, he might see unsuitable sites, hear unsuitable

2849
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:34,680
things, things they will provoke last, diversion and delusion, but because his mind is established

2850
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:39,960
upon perception of the forest, none of these things can touch him.

2851
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:42,360
They cannot disturb him.

2852
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:46,920
And then he reflects further, he says, because I'm established upon the more refined perception

2853
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:52,480
of the forest, perceptions of the village cannot disturb me.

2854
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:57,040
Any disturbance in the rise will be on account of perceptions of the forest, because that's

2855
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,320
what the mind is.

2856
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:04,480
And he can go further, he can establish his mind upon the perception of the earth as

2857
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:09,440
general as it is, element of earth.

2858
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:16,160
And now, not even perceptions of the particular forest can bother him any more, let alone

2859
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:20,480
the village.

2860
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:25,120
So that's like the contemplation of the four elements, that's how it works.

2861
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:30,440
More general, the most general is earth, water, fire and air.

2862
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,800
It doesn't get more general than that.

2863
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,200
Yet, as subtle as it is, the mind can get established.

2864
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:42,400
And the Buddha said, I'll be like earth, or be like fire, when you contemplate the nature

2865
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:47,600
of the earth, you get established through the mindfulness of the earth.

2866
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,640
You don't even say element of earth, because a lot of people are in the implies of

2867
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:52,640
you, element.

2868
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:58,960
You just say earth, designation of earth, stands for solidity, stands for heart, stands

2869
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,360
for earth, and that's it.

2870
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:09,880
You establish the mind, and that's the meditation of casinos, that's exactly that.

2871
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:15,760
Not nothing to do with what people do, exert color discs and stuff like that, they're

2872
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,480
just from serious misunderstanding.

2873
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:25,560
And then the ultimate casina, the ultimate establishment, is the establishment upon the

2874
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:31,720
casina of consciousness.

2875
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:36,520
So in the same sense that you establish upon the perceptions of the forest and established

2876
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:42,760
upon earth, and so on, you can get established upon consciousness.

2877
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:51,480
Why? Because if you establish upon the nature of presence, in regard to that which is

2878
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:58,360
present, then whatever is present cannot disturb you.

2879
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:03,920
Because you're established in regard to the nature of presence of that which is present.

2880
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,560
So you cannot disturb you.

2881
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,120
And literally whatever you experience is present, which means whatever you experience

2882
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,800
cannot disturb you anyway.

2883
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,080
And the Buddha said that the ultimate, that's the supreme, the most refined casina you

2884
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,640
can get established.

2885
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:21,880
But you don't need to go that far, even the first element of earth is enough to abandon

2886
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:27,080
everything inferior to it, as the Buddha will refer to it, which is everything.

2887
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:35,400
Because again, whatever arises in your experience has a degree, has an element of solidity in

2888
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:40,120
it, has an element of earth present, a phenomenon of earth present.

2889
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:44,440
If you establish upon that, you're surmounted everything that has that, and everything

2890
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,120
has that, which means you're surmounted everything.

2891
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:56,680
In my case, in my medicine station, now practice what I'm doing, it's all those things

2892
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:03,720
are also with different things, like in my case, when you have thoughts coming up, or

2893
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:09,880
bubbles as you refer to it, whatever it's different perceptions, try not to forget about

2894
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:15,120
the general situation you're in.

2895
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:20,640
The fact that you're sitting in your room, on the floor, or on the chair, that's already

2896
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:25,160
the situation, seated in such and such situation.

2897
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:29,800
That's a general thought, that's one experience.

2898
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:35,200
Within that, and while you are in that position and that thought, whatever you're thinking

2899
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,240
of, whatever you're feeling, whatever you're hearing, whatever you're seeing, you can

2900
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:41,440
be mindful of that, from that perspective.

2901
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:47,040
But if you forget about the general situation, then you'll end up chasing every particular

2902
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:53,120
thought or perception of earth, and that's a problem, that there is no mindfulness there,

2903
01:49:53,120 --> 01:50:00,120
no rather very little mindfulness, not established.

2904
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:12,040
So, in that case, I was thinking that the need to see all the bubbles, this is not mine,

2905
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:17,400
and that these bubbles are calling it as I am, and the same view and the dependent relation

2906
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:18,400
I have to think of.

2907
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:23,880
Now we'll see the problem with that is I am seeing all of this, which means your general

2908
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,120
sense of why it remains unaffected.

2909
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:32,720
You have to reverse that, you have to start indirectly, whereby you see yourself first

2910
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:37,920
in this situation, while you're in that situation, whatever is in front of you, you start

2911
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,280
being mindful of that.

2912
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:45,360
When that mindfulness is established enough, it becomes apparent then, like you don't

2913
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:52,520
see it, you don't invent it, you just discern it as already there.

2914
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:58,600
And what is already there is that, as I said before, the general situation during defines

2915
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:04,280
these particular bubbles and thoughts and perceptions, but they are the ones enabling the

2916
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:09,960
general situation to be such in the first place.

2917
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:16,120
So you recognize that relationship with the dependence between this general and particular

2918
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:22,760
level, out there, not me and I am doing it, not in front of me, not for me, it's just

2919
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:27,040
there, because you are there sitting in the room, while you are there sitting in the room,

2920
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:31,320
you are thinking certain things, while you are sitting in the room on your chair, looking

2921
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:36,200
through the window, you are thinking certain things.

2922
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:40,120
Would you be thinking those things, if you are not in that room sitting in that chair looking

2923
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:43,840
through the window, you might well not be thinking that.

2924
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:48,600
So your general situation determines, defines these certain things, defines significance

2925
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:53,400
of those things, thought in that situation.

2926
01:51:53,400 --> 01:52:01,160
But then again, if you are not thinking in your room on your chair, like if there was

2927
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:05,080
no chair, there was no room, no window, you are not thinking, would you be able to have

2928
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:09,960
a situation of me sitting on the chair looking through the window thinking these things?

2929
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:13,920
You couldn't.

2930
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:22,160
So that's how they depend on each other, and none of it can be yours for that very reason.

2931
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:25,640
Does mindfulness on body mean that not only the body, the situation on the ground?

2932
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:30,360
Yeah, mindfulness on the body means mindfulness on the situation, the body is in.

2933
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:37,040
Not the actual physical posture, and observing of like, oh, this is how my knee feels and

2934
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:41,240
this is probably something, that's all already because you are in that situation, you can

2935
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:44,200
look at those particular things.

2936
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:51,320
And you can, if you want, while you are seated on the floor in a certain posture, if you

2937
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:55,840
start looking particular aspects of your body, your hands, your knees, your feet, your

2938
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,960
head, again, you can do it rightly, you can do it wrongly.

2939
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:05,120
If you do it rightly, you see those particular components being defined by the fact that

2940
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:11,160
the body is generally already there, but at the same time, without those particular components,

2941
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:16,240
that body couldn't have not there is any such in the first place.

2942
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:21,040
It's the same principle.

2943
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:24,160
But if you just go at the components, forget about the whole picture, and just as this

2944
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:31,160
is not mine, this is not mine, nothing will change really.

2945
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:42,720
Before I was missing the point, if I was thinking this body, this body, or what is this body

2946
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:43,720
doing?

2947
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:48,440
It's not that important thing, just I only have to keep seeing the feelings arise, as

2948
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:53,440
I thought, as a bubble in the mind, and just need to keep knowing that everything is

2949
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:58,880
appearing on their own, so situation works so well, but anyway, feelings are rising,

2950
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,880
wherever I am.

2951
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:05,600
Yeah, again, you can do that, but even then, you need a reference point in regard to what

2952
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,600
you're looking at.

2953
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:11,920
So, you might not want to be mindful of the body, that's fine, if you want to be mindful

2954
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:14,600
of the feelings, you need a reference point in regard to that.

2955
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:20,600
In other words, there is always a situation that you have to be mindful of, there is always

2956
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:25,360
more general and more particular, that's needed for mindfulness to be established.

2957
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:31,200
You can't just be staring at the particular and being mindful, I am mindful, or rather

2958
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:37,000
that mindfulness is not really established mindfulness.

2959
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:47,520
So, if you're mindful of your feelings arising, again, you can be anchored, established in

2960
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:58,160
your situation, in terms of bodily posture, while I'm walking fear arose, while I'm walking

2961
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:05,920
fear is present, while I'm walking fear is present, while I'm walking fear is ceasing,

2962
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:16,040
while I'm walking fear is gone, as opposed to I'm afraid, I'm not afraid.

2963
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:26,960
Oh, it's like the most subtle, you can get established in terms of mind object, thought,

2964
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:27,960
dhamma.

2965
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:35,960
That's another satipatana, whereby I'm feeling this on account of this memory, or on

2966
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:43,440
account of what somebody said, or on account of something I've seen.

2967
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:50,360
For as long as that reason, I've seen something unpleasant, I feel bad.

2968
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:55,320
For as long as this unpleasant thing is present, bad feeling endures.

2969
01:55:55,320 --> 01:56:02,240
I'm pleasant feeling, unpleasant thing ceases, bad feeling is gone.

2970
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:13,400
So, you see the feeling coming from that thing.

2971
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:17,600
Not from you, belonging to that thing, not to you.

2972
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:23,200
And again, you can see the fear belonging to the body in the situation, not to me, I'm

2973
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,200
afraid.

2974
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:26,200
Because of the situation.

2975
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:27,200
Yeah.

2976
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:33,960
And that's how you abandon both, situation, and the particular thing that has a reason.

2977
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,120
Not because of me.

2978
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:43,120
Because if it comes from me, me will never be abandoned.

2979
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:48,880
So, it's important to see that the relation, is it not enough support if I total forgot

2980
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,880
about the situation with this body?

2981
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,200
You can't forget about it.

2982
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:56,000
You can ignore it, but it's already there.

2983
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:02,040
In the meditation support if I just keep seeing the bubbles arising in the circle.

2984
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:05,800
And just, whatever arises, everything actually arising on their own.

2985
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:10,720
The only reason particular things that arise, can arise, is from the perspective of a more

2986
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:14,240
general situation that it's already there.

2987
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:22,000
In other words, the movement of arising and ceasing is impossible if there is no static

2988
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,360
point in regard to it.

2989
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:26,280
That's just the nature of things.

2990
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,440
If everything is moving, there's no movement.

2991
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:34,360
But the fact that you discern bubbles coming and going means there is a point that is

2992
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:37,040
still in regard to that.

2993
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,600
And that point is your situation.

2994
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:42,480
That is more general than those particular changing bubbles.

2995
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:46,280
So, you cannot, but not have it.

2996
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:48,640
You can only ignore it.

2997
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:49,640
And that's not good.

2998
01:57:49,640 --> 01:58:01,440
Does that know that they can't go through a less tanky mildly or somewhat like that?

2999
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:06,880
No, there's a part, yeah, yeah, well, with that, there is only doing meditation also.

3000
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:12,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the whole thing, it's not like the A4 part and the A8 components

3001
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,640
they need to be developed.

3002
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:19,560
But it's not one, and then you develop two, and then you develop, in some of it is Sutta.

3003
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:26,280
The Sutta they talk about, the main Sutta, Majemika 9, he says that, with every of those

3004
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:31,920
factors, it's governed by the first factor of the right view.

3005
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,600
So knowing things rightly, it's too fast to go through, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's get

3006
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:36,600
you to see.

3007
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:37,600
No, sorry.

3008
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:38,600
No, it's fine.

3009
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:39,600
What's right?

3010
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:43,960
Knowing things rightly, would make your meditation right, would make your reading the

3011
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,520
Sutta's right, would make your actions right, your seal of right, everything will become

3012
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:51,880
right if you know that it's right.

3013
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,760
So that's how it's done.

3014
01:58:53,760 --> 01:59:00,800
So the thing is, people misunderstand meditation as a separate thing from contemplating the

3015
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,920
dharma, but it's not.

3016
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:09,800
One like meditation brings contemplation, contemplation brings meditation.

3017
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:16,040
So if your meditation is not making any difference to your contemplation, that's a wrong meditation.

3018
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:22,280
And he said it's like two yokes pulling each other, and the two yokes, if one goes forward

3019
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:24,920
what the other one will have, because they're connected.

3020
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:29,400
So if you're putting forward some of that, the person that will be there, it's not like

3021
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:33,360
I'll do some of that here, then I'll go the other way and do a bit of a person there.

3022
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:39,120
No, if you don't be a person, your meditation is coming with it, you can't even conceive

3023
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:40,120
being separate.

3024
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:43,480
And if you read the Sutta's meditation, like Kanapana Sati, it's all this practice of

3025
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:44,480
this mindfulness.

3026
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:49,800
And you got to more generally like, while I'm reading, I will feel this, while I'm reading

3027
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:53,400
I'll think that.

3028
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:58,760
So being skilled in recognizing situation, you're inevitably, you can't even conceive

3029
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:06,760
not being in situation, because if you think I'm not in a situation, that is your situation.

3030
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:11,880
And then you don't even have to constantly think about your situation, but in your daily

3031
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:16,800
life, the fact that there are particular things, like, oh, I need to sweep this floor now

3032
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,440
and clean this up.

3033
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:22,920
It's only possible, because the floor in the cave and all the significance of the whole

3034
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:28,160
thing is already present in my situation, and then I can attempt to these particular things.

3035
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:31,200
I can't fool with the situation, or what does it mean?

3036
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:38,080
No, you can forget it, but you can't escape it, you forget it when you're not mindful.

3037
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:43,040
You ignore it, then you get caught up in particular things, and then you suffer more on the

3038
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:48,920
particular things, or you get elated more on a kind of particular things.

3039
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:53,160
In either way, you get moved much more by the particular things, you suffer.

3040
02:00:53,160 --> 02:01:08,400
It's probably, I don't know, very new for you to hear this, but even if it's not, it's

3041
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:09,400
not something.

3042
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,920
It's not something you can just hear somebody say once, and then you are.

3043
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:18,320
You can get the idea, but you have to keep doing it, and like the nature of intention

3044
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:24,720
works the same, like, because you had intention to come here today to see me and talk about

3045
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:29,840
the Dunlain, that's a very general intention you had.

3046
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:35,160
While that intention was still present, you went and hired a tuk-tuk, there was a more

3047
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:42,320
particular intention, calling the driver, telling him to come, giving him the time.

3048
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:46,480
Walking to the tuk-tuk, sitting in the tuk-tuk, being in the tuk-tuk, coming here, walking,

3049
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:51,760
finding the place, getting lost, realizing that you were lost, finding the right way.

3050
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:57,280
All of those particular intentions were within the intention of you wanting to be here,

3051
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:58,800
talk tuk-tuk.

3052
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:05,480
If that general intention, you wanting to be here, tuk-tuk, disappears, but if you suddenly

3053
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:10,600
change your mind on the way here, ooh, I can't go there today, that's it.

3054
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:11,600
You go back.

3055
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:20,360
All of those particular intentions then lose their general, like, a significant direction.

3056
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:24,280
You change your mind, suddenly I called and said I had to go to a hospital or something

3057
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:25,280
like that.

3058
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:31,400
If the general intention of you wanting to be here, changes, whether through you or through

3059
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:35,440
the circumstances, all of the particular intentions, then go.

3060
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:38,880
I cannot go there, therefore, why would you be calling a tuk-tuk, telling him to bring

3061
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:39,880
you here?

3062
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:40,880
No.

3063
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:46,520
If you're about to make a phone call to call a driver, but then you find out if you

3064
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:50,720
can't come, you're not going to be doing this particular.

3065
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:55,320
So that's how you can be mindful of all of those particular intentions by knowing what

3066
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:57,400
the general intention in regard to them.

3067
02:02:57,400 --> 02:03:04,760
And obviously, there is no end to generality, nor there is an end to particularity.

3068
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:07,680
But that's not important.

3069
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:12,280
You won't have to reach the end or the first point, because there won't be any.

3070
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:15,720
The whole point is to understand that relationship.

3071
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:20,920
So if, sometimes, you had an intention to come here, but then your mindfulness is not

3072
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,520
established upon that intention.

3073
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:27,240
Well, then you can establish your mindfulness upon even more general intention of intention

3074
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:30,920
of you wanting to understand the dharma.

3075
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:34,880
As a result of you wanting to understand the dharma, you want to come here particularly

3076
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:36,560
and talk about the dharma.

3077
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:39,600
As a result of you wanting to understand the dharma, you want to come here and talk the

3078
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:40,600
dharma.

3079
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:44,040
You want to call the talk to driver and tell him to come at certain time and bring you

3080
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,040
here.

3081
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:48,640
As a result of all of that, you will sit in the talk to for two and a half hours.

3082
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:53,640
As a result of that, you will be excellent and so on and so forth.

3083
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:58,520
So you can pick any of those things as long as you're mindful in regard to particular.

3084
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:02,440
Now just chase the particular or get lost in the general.

3085
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,680
It's the relationship that's important.

3086
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:08,760
And that relationship is Sankara, Sankata dharma.

3087
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:11,200
The whole experience is dual in that sense.

3088
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:12,200
Everything.

3089
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:14,200
Everything experience falls into that.

3090
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,360
That's when you recall the fundamental structure.

3091
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:20,280
It's the structure of the experience, the structure of the aggregates.

3092
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:24,680
And the Buddha said, even if somebody is remembering one previous life, five previous

3093
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:30,360
lives, five hundred previous lives, all they're remembering is these five or one among

3094
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:31,360
them.

3095
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,600
These five aggregates are one among them.

3096
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:34,600
Nothing.

3097
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:35,600
Nothing out of that.

3098
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:36,600
It's all within.

3099
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:39,600
All within the same structure.

3100
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:46,120
The intention of this choosing, these things actually are really confusing because they

3101
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:49,600
have a sense of self, really, really, really, in intention.

3102
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:50,600
Yeah.

3103
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:57,160
The closest, closest relation, like intention is that with the sense of service, but again,

3104
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:02,480
if you start looking in terms of the situation, the only reason you can intend to drink that

3105
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:06,720
glass of water is because it's already there in your situation.

3106
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:13,840
So the particular intention, well, exactly, you can choose what's already given.

3107
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:18,400
If you haven't been given and displayed through your senses, you can't even conceive it,

3108
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:22,040
let alone intend it.

3109
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:27,240
But if you're just looking and focusing on the particular, then your intention will

3110
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:31,800
always feel very direct, always feel me and Aliya.

3111
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:35,440
Well, yeah, I want to drink water, but the only reason I can drink water is because there

3112
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:39,920
is water here, drinkable water, and there is a little, and then you realize, even this

3113
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:45,640
whole sense of I want to do this is actually determined by that general situation, because

3114
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:50,640
if that thing changes, no matter how strong my sense of self is, if there is no water

3115
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:55,280
to drink it here, that intention will not make sense, and I might have to go somewhere

3116
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:56,280
else.

3117
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:59,600
That's totally up here, you know, I don't know, I think it is.

3118
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:05,240
Now, if you start looking through a situation, the relationship becomes more and more apparent,

3119
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:11,320
the relationship that is mutually determining and kind of not requiring your sense of self

3120
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:14,640
at all.

3121
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:19,720
So the more you are aware of it, the more you discern it, less of it is yours.

3122
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:27,040
Externally, not much can change, not much needs to change, obviously, virtuous behavior

3123
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:35,200
and so on, but that's it.
