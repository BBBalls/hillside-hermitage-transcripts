1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,360
So it's generally referring to like the senses, but also then kind of what the senses disclose.

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,840
Like I was thinking about like how I disclose, for example like space and distance and stuff

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,160
through to the senses and trying to figure that out.

4
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,880
So I'll just read to you what I wrote and you can stop me any time, so I wrote the

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:47,800
senses can be discerned as a point of view or an orientation regarding things.

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:55,400
The working sense base allows for the disclosure of a respected field for a respected world

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:03,280
of visual objects of sounds etc. It must absolutely be this point of view for there to be experience

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,120
to have no point of view or every point of view is inconceivable and completely abstract.

9
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:20,160
Furthermore the position of this point of view corresponds with the location of that respective

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,240
matter as disclosed through other senses. The one must be sure to remember that this is

11
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,180
not the matter itself. I can touch my eyeball, but that is a perception of touch, not the

12
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,720
eye which is that by which there is vision.

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,200
Hence the senses are negative phenomena, they do not appear, but the fact that there

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,260
is a presentation within limits allows for their discernment, the senses then also

15
00:01:51,260 --> 00:02:00,600
disclose space such as in the form of distance, area and so on. Thus I can designate a near

16
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:11,000
or far or a hear or yonder and so on. This here by appropriating the senses, it comes

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,040
me in terms of a spatial positioning. I am here, things are there. I am internal, everything

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,800
else is external. With the cessation of that appropriation, things still stand in the

19
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:35,160
world, but now simply seen as a conscious space body and name and form externally.

20
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:47,420
I was going to say, when you started, I was about to say, you have to point out that

21
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,760
senses do not appear, but then you pointed it out.

22
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,520
I just was on a tangent at one point where it is kind of like, how do I know that the

23
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,520
sense there is, they do not appear, and that is because there are things, that is how

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
you can infer.

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Yes, you can know. I was just kind of working on that word as point of view, instead of

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,520
using the designation senses.

27
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,520
It is a point of view because it is already, anything that is directed, which I think

28
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,520
is conscious, it is already directed. There is consciousness, there is a direction, which

29
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,520
is there is a point of view, and senses in themselves, they have their own direction of

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,520
senses towards sense objects.

31
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Absolutely, that is what point of view is.

32
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,520
One other thing I was also thinking about is, in terms of mind, I was trying to sort out

33
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:58,520
my ideas on what mind as mono, first mind as chitta.

34
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:06,520
I understand in some basic sense that mono is like, let's say, that by which I can imagine

35
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:14,520
things, imaginary objects, realistic objects.

36
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:21,520
So in that kind of sense, though, is there some overlap between that and, let's say,

37
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,520
a thought of a feeling, let's say.

38
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Is that something that appears in the senses that I want to describe that, or is it different?

39
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Would you mean thought of a feeling?

40
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Like, I think such a feeling is present as a thought.

41
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,520
And as one could describe it, it has like a mind object with the mind sense base.

42
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Yeah, sure.

43
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
So then the chitta refers to something different.

44
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Yes.

45
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
And what's that?

46
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Well, chitta refers to the actual feeling with big felt, and perception that is being

47
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:12,520
perceived, the peripheral of that, people of chitta is.

48
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,520
So simultaneous presence of Sangha and Vedina.

49
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,520
That's what chitta is in regard to that.

50
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,520
That's the first role that he said.

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Well, yeah.

52
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
You can say another.

53
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,520
That's the previous presence with the presence of Sangha and Chalva and Vedina.

54
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,520
The simultaneous, to the same extent.

55
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,520
So to the extent of feeling being felt, perception being perceived, the mind is there.

56
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
So in terms of the mind as a sense.

57
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:58,520
So it's not actually inaccurate to translate it as heart, as I really mentioned once,

58
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,520
because it involves feelings, obviously.

59
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,520
That chitta is inconceivable without feelings being felt, perceptions perceived.

60
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,520
So it's the mind on that level.

61
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,520
By the way, you want to say heart, because it brings notion of self-indulgence.

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
Oh, kind of.

63
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Yeah.

64
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:30,520
So it's certainly, it's certainly, well, you can say it's, well,

65
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
it's a completely different phenomenon.

66
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:40,520
But it's also, as such, it is quite a, quite a more of a, of a, of a negative.

67
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,520
More general than man with itself would be.

68
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,520
The actual thinking in terms of the mind objects.

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,520
So when it comes to chitta, it's, it's more passive in that regard.

70
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,520
In comparison to the mind.

71
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
So you can't.

72
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
That's why, that's why the moods, the states of mind,

73
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,520
a late in mind, depressed mind, mind with joy, a cornerless mind,

74
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
kind of very, very general states.

75
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,520
You discern as something that has a reason.

76
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,520
And you just find it as, as such.

77
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Which means those, those moves are of, of a very general nature.

78
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,520
And, and basically.

79
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Yeah.

80
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,520
You can't be actively, so to speak, involved on that level.

81
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,520
In as much as you could with, with actually choosing what you want to think.

82
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Yeah.

83
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
In terms of the mind objects.

84
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
And that's probably important to distinguish, because people are mind, mind.

85
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,520
And then when the moods are present or some, quite, quite general kind of feelings

86
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and big used perceptions.

87
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,520
They know, we got back in the same sense as, as people regarded.

88
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
So which is why, actually.

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Often people dismiss it as well.

90
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,520
We have said, let's just accept thought.

91
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Cause they can't, they can't conceive it in any other way.

92
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
So that they played all in front of them.

93
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Yes.

94
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:20,600
But so Chita is more of something that's being felt, and obviously some of them use the

95
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,940
perceived at that general level, in some biguse notion, like a notion of expansion, a notion

96
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:36,560
of trunk, a notion of light, a notion of heavy, those are the perceptions in regard to Chita.

97
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:46,560
And then you can say that we use a term accessible, inaccessible, in terms of root, but especially.

98
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Could we say something similar with Chita, like that, whenever there's a mood of the mind,

99
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,560
they say, you can say basically the same in regard to the whole five aggregates.

100
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,560
They're really inaccessible to it, in their nature.

101
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Now know either, you access it. You develop up around it in regard to it, and you assume that.

102
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,560
So I think I'm in a bad mood, but that thought is not the mood itself.

103
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Exactly, exactly.

104
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,560
But because you don't know what the mood itself is, that's thought, which is actually not,

105
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,560
the mood itself, is the only thing that stands for that mood for you in that experience.

106
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:34,560
You assume that, and it is.

107
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Because I was thinking too about, like, in terms of sense basis.

108
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:54,560
There's a, this seems to me in some sense, out of what this, some, like, sort of say, different view required,

109
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,560
like, for the mind as opposed to, like, the eye.

110
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Because, like, it was back to the distance, for example.

111
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,560
We can't, doesn't make really distance in my mind, except in reference to the other sense basis.

112
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,560
But, like, in terms of just a thought, there's no distance, so to say.

113
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Well, yeah, I mean, there is no, so much of a defined distance, but the distance is very much there.

114
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,560
The space is very much there.

115
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
It's actually primarily spaces metal.

116
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
That's what the space is.

117
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,560
What the intentions are with the movement is, the notion of movement, even if nothing moves.

118
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,560
The possibility of movement.

119
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,560
So they'll ask at least in a space.

120
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,560
No, that's how space is being generated, so to speak.

121
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,560
So, that's how, because of that, you can see it in things, around it.

122
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
So, it is, that's why space can be used.

123
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,560
So, it's often described as one of, like, after the four great elements, then the element of space, the element of consciousness.

124
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Or, it's not a fundamental one.

125
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
It almost is.

126
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
I mean, it's only in person, or, obviously.

127
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,560
And they have that base of infinite space.

128
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,560
So, I found that, or curious.

129
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Well, it is, it is.

130
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,560
And, obviously, it's, you know, there is plenty of things to be contemplated on.

131
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
In regard to that.

132
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
In terms of, to develop your mind.

133
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Because, if you do develop a notion of space, I'm even being spaced out.

134
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Spaced for that.

135
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,560
I mean, like, generally, understanding that the phenomenon of space, as a negative in regard to the phenomena that appear.

136
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
But it's, it's real as such.

137
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
It is real as a negative phenomenon.

138
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,560
What do you mean by it as a negative?

139
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Well, the space without the object is in concealment, without the object, sir, that is, it is in concealment.

140
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,560
So, there is no such thing as a pure space.

141
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Even the infinite space.

142
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560
It's the infinite negative.

143
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
So, you step into it, negative, though.

144
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,560
You don't take it up as an object, which is important.

145
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
You can't look at it that way.

146
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Exactly.

147
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:20,560
So, it is more simple level than, let's say, space disclosed through my eye.

148
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:28,560
You're saying, basically, that all that appears is, of course, vision and objects of vision.

149
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:40,560
And within that field, it's almost like you're saying, basically, space is only disclosed by objects.

150
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Well, space is disclosed by mind in regard to objects.

151
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,560
So, the eye and the objects, there wouldn't be any space, discerned.

152
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,560
But then, obviously, there wouldn't be any scene, discerned if there is no mind present.

153
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
So, it's that presence of the mind.

154
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,560
That's what space is.

155
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Yeah, I'm having trouble seeing that.

156
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
I can understand that, no mind or vision.

157
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
No, you don't have to see it elsewhere.

158
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Basically, what you think now, that the space is, that's being discerned through your eye and the vision,

159
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,560
stay with that same space, just putting the place of mind.

160
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Don't attribute it to the eye.

161
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,560
But it's the same thing that you've seen.

162
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,560
You're just assuming it at the wrong place.

163
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,560
So, the eye can only see, but the mind is not disclosed here, the under and the between.

164
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Well, yes, but see, even the eye can only see, would make any sense.

165
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,560
You couldn't even think that if you can't think it.

166
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,560
But if it's not being thought.

167
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,560
So, the senses, regardless of the mind, are inconceivable.

168
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,560
They don't operate.

169
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,560
So, that's, you know, you won't find the space, it's clearly defined phenomena in your mind.

170
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,560
But what I'm explaining now might be enough, basically, to just sort of bring it back,

171
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,560
just a couple of millimeters back, so to speak, which is enough to stop assuming

172
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,560
and rooting that space into the actual eye and forms,

173
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,560
means basically misconceiving it.

174
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,560
So, in that sense, that's why the mind comes first.

175
00:14:49,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Although the whole notion of space, for example, is negative in regard to things that appear.

176
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Structurally, it precedes things that appear.

177
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Space, their mind.

178
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Either way, let's, we're talking about space.

179
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
So, let's say space.

180
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,560
So, if you then discern that, that, okay, so space can't stand on its own.

181
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,560
You know that. So, you're not misconceiving it as a separate mystical universal entity

182
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,560
of some of some great providence of the divine nature or whatever else.

183
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
So, you know what it is.

184
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
You discern it as an eighth phenomena.

185
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,560
But, you know that it comes structurally.

186
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,560
So, simultaneously present with the things that have been seen,

187
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,560
her touch, taste, smell, taste and thought of.

188
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,560
So, the space is simultaneously present with those things.

189
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,560
But, it structurally precedes them.

190
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,560
It's more fundamental.

191
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Which is how people under-pursuming that space and time are universal entities.

192
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
That we inhabit in.

193
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
We are in them.

194
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,560
But, obviously, there is overshooting the mark.

195
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
That's when you give it complete independence.

196
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
But, it's not independent.

197
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
It would not be discernible.

198
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
The space, if there are no things that occupy space.

199
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,560
But, there is a truth in it in a sense that it is more primordial structurally.

200
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,560
So, not before, not after.

201
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Simultaneous to present.

202
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
And, in that sense, it precedes.

203
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
It comes first.

204
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
And then everything else comes second.

205
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
So, if your mind is discerned directly,

206
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,560
and establishes itself upon the phenomenon of space,

207
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,560
then you can see basically how it will be withdrawn.

208
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,560
The mind from everything else that occupies that space.

209
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,560
With your established mind on that.

210
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Exactly.

211
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:53,560
And such general negative phenomenon of space is infinite.

212
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
It's not kept to it.

213
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
You can put it on the system today.

214
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
And the mind gets established upon that.

215
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
And if it is established upon that,

216
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,560
it can't possibly be exercised for it to attain any last version of the illusion

217
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,560
in regard to anything that occupies that space.

218
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Now, is that seen as circumstantially risen?

219
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
That infinity of space.

220
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
That's, I'm going to go on a limb and say,

221
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,560
that's not referring to, like, oh, the universe is infinitely...

222
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Oh, absolutely not.

223
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
No, no, no.

224
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
That's the projected concealed space in time.

225
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,560
The protrusion of space in time.

226
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
They look scientific.

227
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Exactly.

228
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Scientific space in time.

229
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
No, no, no, no.

230
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,560
The infinity of space is the infinity of the mind.

231
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,560
The infinity of the attention is the infinity of the structure

232
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,560
of the five aggregates.

233
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,560
So what are we saying when we're saying space?

234
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Then what are we saying?

235
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Like, what is space referring to, I guess, one of the space?

236
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
Space.

237
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Yeah.

238
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Like...

239
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,560
There is space between you and me, space.

240
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Yeah, you can, you can, you can, particularly, you can say that there is also space.

241
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,560
And she is the same nature as the general, you know,

242
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,560
base of infinity, infinite space.

243
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
I have to think about that some more.

244
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Yeah.

245
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,560
You have to, basically, the mind is trained in regard to it,

246
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,560
because you don't want to make it into an object.

247
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Like, you, me, two positives.

248
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,560
And a different angle of the spectrum from this point of view.

249
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
And then, oh, where is the space now?

250
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,560
And then you try to grasp the space in the same positive terms.

251
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Try to disclose it in the same manner.

252
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
You want that...

253
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Well, you'll disclose something, but that won't be the space.

254
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
So if you think that is that what space is,

255
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
then you'll be serious when it's consuming it.

256
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Or not finding it.

257
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,560
So it has to be seen the same level as mind, so to say.

258
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
Yes.

259
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Has to be seen as a peripheral phenomena that structurally comes first.

260
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Not temporarily.

261
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,560
What is meant when something structurally comes first?

262
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
It means it's simultaneously present.

263
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
But it's not second.

264
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
It's first.

265
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,560
And you're saying you can have ideas of non-temporal with at first and second.

266
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Yeah.

267
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
First and second.

268
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Well, you can have this and this.

269
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,560
But one of the best is the first best.

270
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
The other one is the second best.

271
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,560
As if one is more fundamental than the other one.

272
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Well, it's fundamental.

273
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Fundamental means basically it precedes the other one in that order.

274
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,560
So imagine you have a line of people in front of you.

275
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Or just two people in front of you.

276
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
They're in the same line.

277
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,560
They don't let the right not before or after.

278
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
They're right there at the same time.

279
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
But one of them is closer.

280
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,560
The other one isn't.

281
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Close.

282
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Yeah.

283
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Can you explain that?

284
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,560
It's a vertical point.

285
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Not the linear.

286
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Like you said in the preface.

287
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Yes.

288
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Okay.

289
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
I think you're the virus in there.

290
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Yeah.

291
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Yeah.

292
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
That's better in there.

293
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Yeah.

294
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,560
So simultaneous presence of the two things.

295
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Why is it close to the other one?

296
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,560
But they're both simultaneously present.

297
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Is that similar to like thinking of things as more external, less external?

298
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Or is that a different kind of route?

299
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Well, it's a different route.

300
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
It will be a different route.

301
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Yeah.

302
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,560
How do we do the right with the same simultaneous principle?

303
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
But it's over there.

304
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
But yeah, I wouldn't try to.

305
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,560
But yeah, I wouldn't try to.

306
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,560
I realized after I said it, I know.

307
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Yeah.

308
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,560
It's a different route.

309
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
And the first thing is the mind.

310
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,560
It's always the first, most first, first.

311
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Yes.

312
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Yeah.

313
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Is it something like a place which has no good cavity?

314
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,560
It's the things.

315
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Place.

316
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,560
If it wasn't, there wasn't a place for it.

317
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,560
So it could be placed.

318
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,560
It's a place, but you can't.

319
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Space.

320
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Yeah.

321
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Space is that it's a kind of place which it places.

322
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
It's like a place.

323
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Yeah.

324
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
You can say that.

325
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,560
I know what you're doing, but the thing is, when you say place,

326
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
you put imagine an actual setup.

327
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Yeah.

328
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Yeah.

329
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Yeah.

330
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,560
It's like a non-located unit.

331
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Well, that's the thing, because the structure,

332
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,560
the space is infinite, so to speak.

333
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,560
That means that's why things are possible to arise on a particular level

334
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,560
on the basis of that space.

335
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,560
So the mind, mind, is off space and off time,

336
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
not in space and in time.

337
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
It's made of it.

338
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
That's where the mind is.

339
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,560
So that's why you want to think about that because in that,

340
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
when you think about mind,

341
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
well, you won't make it mind.

342
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
You'll see it as part of the space.

343
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
And when you think about the space, scientific space,

344
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
you won't make it into scientific space because you know

345
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,560
well, it wouldn't be there because that's where the mind is.

346
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,560
But if you divorce it, then yes, you get the scientific space

347
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
that we want to have it and you get this mind,

348
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,560
inside of this brain, then nobody,

349
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,560
the only mean knows and sees.

350
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,560
But space is off mind and off time,

351
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,560
not in space and in time.

352
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,560
It brings to mind, like if you,

353
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,560
you know, you get a lot of people trying to organize

354
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
their thoughts in it.

355
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,560
It almost feels like they're organizing things in space,

356
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
like mental space.

357
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,560
A very mundane example, but it's trying to start with.

358
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Well, yeah.

359
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,560
If the mind is off space,

360
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
you can possibly be entering this external public

361
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
assumed space over the science.

362
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
It's going to work without me.

363
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,560
I would also contribute to me starting to think in this way

364
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,560
was I was observing a particular thought, let's say.

365
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
And it's so easy to assume,

366
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,560
oh, my thoughts are happening here somewhere.

367
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,560
And that's where I got thing, oh,

368
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,560
just not why assume that.

369
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,560
And that's how the mind can expand itself

370
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
in terms of the development,

371
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,560
in terms of getting established upon different bases.

372
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,560
When you stop assuming it right here,

373
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,560
in this head or whatever,

374
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
whatever kind of assuming,

375
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
because that's completely materialist.

376
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
So then you're actually, you know,

377
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,560
my thought cannot really be placed in this head.

378
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,560
So that's already quite a transcendental dimension,

379
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
that you will never aware of,

380
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
yet it's a simple thought.

381
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Any thought?

382
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Oh, so the thought arises,

383
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
it is real as phenomena,

384
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
it endures,

385
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,560
it persists while it's changing,

386
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
yet you can put it in that space

387
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
that you regard as space,

388
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,560
usually in a common sense reading.

389
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Exactly.

390
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Same with the nature of perception.

391
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Same with any of the aggregates.

392
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Because aggregates are not in space,

393
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,560
they're of space.

394
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,560
For other, the space is basically generated

395
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
by the positioning of the five aggregates

396
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,560
of the simultaneously present matter,

397
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,560
feeling, perception, intentions, and consciousness.

398
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,560
You've got a pinpoint, I'll say.

399
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
No, no, no, no, of course not.

400
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
It's because there it is, isn't it?

401
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Yes, yes.

402
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Because it perceives that destination

403
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
of its there is here.

404
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Because the five aggregates

405
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
are present, it's not one,

406
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
point of view.

407
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
It's five, point of view.

408
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,560
It's five, point of view.

409
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
It's five, the main five heaps.

410
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,560
That's where they're called heaps.

411
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Can't they just pact?

412
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
I mean, they're pact over each other.

413
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,560
So to speak, but not like they don't mix,

414
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
they don't merge, they don't start,

415
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,560
they don't connect, they move into one mass.

416
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,560
They remain fully distinct

417
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,560
and cannot possibly encroach into another domain.

418
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,560
And that's already off space.

419
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
But I think, actually,

420
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,560
is our other space confusing.

421
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,560
I kind of said in the space.

422
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
But it's not in the space.

423
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,560
It's giving the space the priority

424
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
over the five aggregates.

425
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
But it doesn't matter.

426
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,560
That's why you can go past in three different spaces.

427
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
It's not the ultimate development of the mind.

428
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
It's perception and feeling.

429
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Conversation of it, that's the ultimate development of the mind.

430
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Which means space is secondary from that point of view.

431
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Simultaneous present.

432
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Just enough squares.

433
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:53,560
That's what means off space.

434
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
So the space that you're thinking of,

435
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,560
that you're seeing in the established mindfulness

436
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
of experiences are all.

437
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
It's not, you know, there is a space.

438
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,560
You don't have to find the right, the correct space.

439
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,560
All you have to do is stop assuming it as being ultimately the first,

440
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,560
in a sense that everything is inside of it.

441
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,560
So just maintain the Simultaneous presence of that phenomena,

442
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,560
but see it secondary.

443
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Like something's proceeding.

444
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Yeah, something's determining it.

445
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Which in the final gets.

446
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
Which is experiencing it as a whole.

447
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Or resting on it together.

448
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,560
The object's resting on it.

449
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,560
I don't mean that.

450
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
It's supported.

451
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,560
It is caused by the equities.

452
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Well, yes, yes.

453
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Yes, yes.

454
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,560
If that will establish this Simultaneous mindfulness

455
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
of the two Simultaneous things.

456
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Then yeah, you can do that.

457
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,560
But it's not.

458
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:08,560
And the space is not the same protein as the phylogic aids.

459
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,560
It's in regard to them, but not them.

460
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,560
It's very much like up and on it.

461
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Yeah, we'll see if they feed or not.

462
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Well, the space.

463
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Yeah.

464
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Well, no, there's a thing.

465
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Because how can you, well, think of it as this.

466
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,560
How can you have a notion of space if you're not thinking it?

467
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,560
If it's not present as a no matter how ambiguous thought is still a thought.

468
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Which means the mind does come first.

469
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
It is of space.

470
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
It's not in space.

471
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:54,560
So you can't have the mind without the space.

472
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,560
But mind is not in the space.

473
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Because even the ambiguous general mystical notion of just pure space,

474
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
it's a notion.

475
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
It's a thought.

476
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,560
It's a reason they're not present.

477
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
And that would not be the case.

478
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:23,560
If that genuine space would precede your thought and your thought would be in the space.

479
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Well, that is actually inconceivable.

480
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,560
You can't even think of why even that misconception, it's kind of contradictory.

481
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Because you can't even misconceive it even if you want to.

482
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:40,560
That's why once you discern things, you can't undo the knowledge.

483
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Because it just becomes incomprehensible.

484
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,560
So in this particular sense, that you have now a notion of things that are in space.

485
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:55,560
But then that whole notion rests upon ignoring the fact that that space is also thought.

486
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,560
So these thoughts are in the thought.

487
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Well, that's not then the space that I'm attributing it to.

488
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Which means thoughts are thoughts.

489
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,560
So then thoughts of space are thoughts of space.

490
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Can't be thoughts in space.

491
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Because there will be another thought.

492
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,560
So it's inaccessible.

493
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Basically, saying that it's inaccessible means ceasing the assumption of it.

494
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Because when you know when it becomes inaccessible, means you cannot access it through ignorance.

495
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
It's basically cannot be assumed.

496
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Means it's known.

497
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,560
You cannot assume something when you know it.

498
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,560
And that's an involuntary, that's not an optional thing.

499
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,560
There can be worldly assumption that you might have.

500
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Oh, I assume such places, such and such.

501
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,560
And then you find out you've got there and you see for yourself what it is.

502
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,560
And even if your assumption was right, that assumption is gone now.

503
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Because now you actually experienced it and seen it for yourself, understood it.

504
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:19,560
So even if you think about your past assumption, you can't possibly revoke it.

505
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Because now the knowledge is tightly fitted in the space where there's no place for assumption to end it.

506
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Hence it becomes inaccessible to assumption.

507
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:42,560
It's a bit of vision of space.

508
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,560
I see space.

509
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Of space.

510
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Now that space, whatever I perceive it as as a thought, that's not the space.

511
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Well, no, there's no space you have.

512
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,560
So it's either going to be, there's no real space as opposed to space you have.

513
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,560
There's only concealed space or space free from consumers.

514
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,560
So an assumed space or space known for what it is and not assumed.

515
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:27,560
But now you're trying to have both there at the same time and compare them and see which one is right.

516
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:42,560
So the vision of space, it's not technically of space, it's of things that negatively reveal what other show the space as there, as not things.

517
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:54,560
So you kind of say that the difference is like instead of saying this is in space, rather one should say there are things that disclose the presence of space.

518
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:04,560
Yes, and that disclosed space is more fundamental in regard to those particular things that disclose it.

519
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:13,560
But on the point of view of the mind and the final aggregates, it isn't the ultimate fundamental.

520
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:25,560
So as I said, if you use space in a way to practice contemplation in regard to particular things, that's fine because basically that space will stand for the mind.

521
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:41,560
But you want to be careful not to develop views that you are somehow in this universal public space and give it, like, and make it an entity that it's independent of yourself.

522
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,560
So if you want to do that, well then don't forget that the mind is a fundamental thing.

523
00:33:45,560 --> 00:34:11,560
So in other words, what I'm saying, you can take particular things and then practice contemplation in regard to development of the mind, discerning of the nature of the thoughts and the mind and the citta, because that already includes that space.

524
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Basically, all you want to do is develop, or rather descend the principle between the actual and the peripheral.

525
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,560
So if that actual is the extensive object, peripheral will be space in regard to it.

526
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,560
And that's fine, if you develop knowledge of the principle.

527
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,560
But if you start looking at the peripheral space as the actual, well then mind will be peripheral in regard to it.

528
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,560
The final aggregates will be peripheral in regard to it.

529
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,560
So then you develop again, understanding of the same principle.

530
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:54,560
But you don't want to be discerning peripheral space in regard to things and then just assuming the same space that shares the same in regard to the mind as well.

531
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Then you're not the relevant principle of the simultaneous present.

532
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,560
You're not discerning it in regard to either.

533
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:12,560
So space is always peripheral, it's always negative, unless we're thinking.

534
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Then it isn't.

535
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Then you can say something else is, which means what you're thinking of is then not is misconceived space.

536
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Because you think of space where the space cannot be found.

537
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,560
That's why from the point of view of discerning the peripheral, it doesn't matter if you refer to the space or the mind to the peripheral.

538
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:10,560
It doesn't matter how you refer to it, as long as it's seen as peripheral.

539
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:21,560
So then when you have a thought of space, then when you may mind fully in regard to peripheral, it may matter a lot of the peripheral in regard to that thought of this space.

540
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,560
And then soon enough you'll see that that's not the space.

541
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,560
The space is always on the peripheral level.

542
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:43,560
The space, your experiences of space, can be in the space.

543
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:57,560
In the space would mean basically when you would feel it to give a complete independent, what complete independence to the notion of actual thought of space.

544
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:06,560
And then attribute even the peripheral to it, say it's in the space.

545
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,560
And that's a view, that's a wrong view, that's a wrong assumption.

546
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Like this thing, if I say something in space, it's assuming space was already kind of just there hanging out with it.

547
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:40,560
So you can have a thought of the space in the space, but don't give it that full independence and don't attribute that which is peripheral in regard to that thought of this space.

548
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Don't attribute the peripheral to it.

549
00:37:45,560 --> 00:38:11,560
As in everything is in the space, because that's completing your choice with actual no basis for that assumption.

550
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:22,560
And if you want to discern space in the right terms, you don't have to try to think it out because it's pointless.

551
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Just feel the feeling, perceive where there was being perceived simultaneously.

552
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Then experience will be the experience of space.

553
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:49,560
And then experience even precedes the craving that you have now to fit the space in the right terms.

554
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,560
And if you see the craving, then well it's fit in the right terms.

555
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,560
Not pollutants.

556
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:15,560
Hence the emotions of it you might have had then, before that of all space was this space is that it just becomes pointless.

557
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:28,560
I think one has to work very hard to get out of the typical notions of space.

558
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Yeah, well that's the thing, that's what I'm pointing at.

559
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,560
You don't have to get out by thinking your way out.

560
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,560
You just have to get out by seeing it for what it is.

561
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:46,560
So accepted, did you have notions of space? And then that's a present, there is an experience as a whole for what it is.

562
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,560
And then in regard to that, feel the feelings, perceive those perceptions.

563
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:02,560
Basically uprooted with mindfulness. Don't try to figure it out and explain it to yourself.

564
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:12,560
So it needs to be understood and seen and discerned, but it doesn't mean explain it to yourself.

565
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,560
So that's kind of why I wanted to understand something but not necessarily to put it into words.

566
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,560
Well no, no, that means you did not quite understand it.

567
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Okay. That's why you qualify it just as I said it.

568
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Explaining it to yourself, sorry, explaining it to yourself is not, it's not the same as understanding it.

569
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Like explaining it is finding a plausible explanation from the point of view that you still have.

570
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,560
That's why I explained it, it's plausible to me now.

571
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,560
But the criteria of what's plausible are not, it's not fully developed obviously,

572
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,560
because otherwise you wouldn't be resorting to the temporal explanations of things.

573
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,560
What you're referring to is describing something once it has been understood.

574
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,560
And that's definitely not an explanation, it's a description.

575
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Because why? Because throughout that description, the thing remains present because it's understood.

576
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,560
In explanation, that's not the case. In explanation, you might arrive at it.

577
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Well, so you think you arrive at it when you explain it.

578
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,560
But that means you didn't have it to begin with. That's how can you explain it if you don't have it to begin with.

579
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,560
So really, you want to replace explanation with descriptions.

580
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,560
Thermological descriptions. That's what suitors are. Just pure descriptions.

581
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,560
Another, let's say, that's a real space.

582
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,560
Peripheral.

583
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,560
See, even ocean of peripheral, it's already an ocean of...

584
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
It's fans.

585
00:41:43,560 --> 00:42:05,560
Well, in a way, yeah. The expanse.

586
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Oh, this is actually, and then everything else that's not that,

587
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,560
it's already the expanse in regard to it.

588
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,560
That's where the mind is. That's where the space is.

589
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Like foreground.

590
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
So background.

591
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
The experience.

592
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Sure.

593
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Yeah.

594
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,560
So that's why you don't...

595
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,560
That's why when you have, even if you have a thought of doubt, what is space then?

596
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:41,560
Find peripheral in regard to vent. And that's where the space is.

597
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,560
And that's how it becomes impenetrageable to doubt as well.

598
00:42:44,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Because doubt can only be actual.

599
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Going back a bit.

600
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,560
The whole thing we've just been talking about is,

601
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,560
is there is a reason why we can also do...

602
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,560
There's many things like internal external that's also spatial.

603
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
Yes, yeah.

604
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,560
Basically, the external would kind of naturally be attributed to anything that's sort of in space.

605
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,560
In space, actual through the senses.

606
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,560
Everything else, this whole, the expanse, I was referring to,

607
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,560
would be kind of these in videos internal.

608
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,560
But when there's also seen a simple tendency present phenomenon,

609
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,560
not as the sense objects, obviously,

610
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,560
but is that which is, which pertains to the mind,

611
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,560
then, yeah, either way, whether it's internal or external,

612
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:50,560
are seen basically as external in regard to you, to your point of view.

613
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,560
Because, you know, for someone for the untrained mind,

614
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,560
things around me that I can see touch, taste, mouth, and so on.

615
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,560
Those are the ones that I can access that I can have.

616
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,560
And that's everything is external.

617
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Everything that's not that is internal and I'm kind of in between and everywhere.

618
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,560
And usually, people like that for them, their own thoughts are not even seen.

619
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,560
There's something that exists.

620
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,560
They clearly talk about what they think.

621
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:27,560
They will not give it the same amount of existence as they would to the things

622
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,560
that they can obtain through the senses.

623
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Why the mind? Because the mind would so far out,

624
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,560
proliferate the towards the senses that became the threshold of what's real,

625
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:41,560
what the being is, what the extent of the being is.

626
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:50,560
And then everything under that threshold is just assumed to not exist.

627
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Although that's a contradiction in terms of existence.

628
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,560
Because you can say this doesn't exist.

629
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:02,560
Well, it clearly exists, but otherwise you can refer to it.

630
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:10,560
How can you attribute non-existence to something that doesn't appear at all?

631
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,560
You can't, but the fact that it's attributed non-existence to something means it has appeared,

632
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,560
which means it actually exists.

633
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:30,560
That's the same mind from the senses.

634
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
That's right.

635
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Yes, that's what it means, like you can't.

636
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,560
Every reflection, every contemplation,

637
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,560
I didn't mention it in the last of the review,

638
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,560
has to be rooted in the experience as a whole,

639
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,560
mindfulness of the experience as a whole.

640
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,560
It has to be rooted there, that has to be the starting point.

641
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,560
And now think about space on the basis of that.

642
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:09,560
Note on the basis of your preconceived notion of the space that you had from before.

643
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,560
You actually have to...

644
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,560
You might feel the craving to know about it,

645
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,560
but I have to understand it on these terms, you can't.

646
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
It's the same order to those terms.

647
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,560
And there are several terms on the basis of the mindfulness of the experience as a whole,

648
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:30,560
and then there think about space without losing that basis of that mindfulness.

649
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,560
So basically that you descend space within that.

650
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,560
You're going to assume it.

651
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
You don't fabricate it.

652
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:46,560
You find it for what it is.

653
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:53,560
That's you.

654
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,560
That's the point.

655
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,560
It makes everything else.

656
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,560
It reveals everything else.

657
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:03,560
That's deep.

658
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,560
The lens.

659
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,560
The objective here.

660
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,560
If you don't have that, do you have that view?

661
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,560
Anything else?

662
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,560
Be an explanation.

663
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,560
Yeah, pretty much.

664
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,560
And also, as I said,

665
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,560
I'm pretty sure I mentioned that in the last episode as well, you have to know

666
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,560
what you're supposed to do without view.

667
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,560
You have to know that that view is not the end.

668
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,560
It's just the beginning.

669
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,560
That view, basically, is the view,

670
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,560
upon which you can develop discernment.

671
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,560
That view is not the discernment.

672
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,560
The lens here.

673
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Yeah, it's here.

674
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
It's too.

675
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,560
It's too, exactly, for seeing things through that lens.

676
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,560
But for most people, mindfulness and experience of all is the ultimate kind of

677
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,560
combination of the spiritual practice, whereby you just stay mindful in this pure

678
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,560
pristine awareness and what not.

679
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,560
You just stay mindful with your ignorance.

680
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Because you're clearly not trying to revel in it.

681
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,560
Oh, no, too much thinking.

682
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,560
Yeah, too much thinking if you're thinking on a non-mindful base.

683
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Then, yeah, you're just revolving around the same, same ignorance, same assumptions

684
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,560
and basically psychotherapeuticizing your way out of it,

685
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,560
explaining it to yourself, managing whatever else.

686
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,560
That's not the Dharma.

687
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,560
That's not the practice.

688
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,560
But if you establish the mindful base of the mindfulness of experiences of all

689
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:44,560
then you can be all the thinking you want.

690
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,560
Because then it's the right mindful thinking.

691
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,560
It's the thinking, basically, it's the Dharma.

692
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:56,560
Another thought for mental objects is Dhammas.

693
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,560
But people are all dismissed by thinking.

694
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,560
Is this thinking?

695
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,560
Well, we look to them.

696
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,560
All dating God did mindfulness of experiences of all

697
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,560
as this kind of overwhelming spiritual experience.

698
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,560
It's just mindfulness.

699
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,560
It might provide you with some novelty perceptions and all of the feelings

700
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,560
because you never mindful on that level.

701
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,560
But it's just mindfulness of experiences of all.

702
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,560
It's mindfulness of experience.

703
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,560
And then you know when you're supposed to look for within that.

704
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,560
And you know that, but even so.

705
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,560
By the service of this, by the investigation of the meeting.

706
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,560
You won't tell you the answers by itself, which is what people think.

707
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Just teach me what I need to know.

708
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,560
I've heard it so many times.

709
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
It's like, yeah, right.

710
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,560
You know that it will teach you what you need to know.

711
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,560
It will teach you more evidence.

712
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,560
Otherwise, you will naturally be free from some sort.

713
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,560
Yeah, that's what you have to take up with it.

714
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,560
You're ready for some sort of perception.

715
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,560
You need the right instruction here.

716
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,560
The basis for contemplation.

717
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,560
Think about the senses.

718
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,560
Yeah, with that.

719
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,560
And full understanding of the fire against.

720
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,560
Full understanding of the same basis.

721
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,560
Full understanding of what it's about.

722
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,560
Full understanding of now that we are in our Europa.

723
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,560
Full understanding of anything from the sutras.

724
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,560
Think of that.

725
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,560
Full understanding of wholesome is wholesome, unwholesome is unwholesome.

726
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,560
Doesn't matter what it is from the sutras.

727
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,560
The whole thing is fully understood from the basis of mindfulness.

728
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,560
So this means it's a home.

729
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,560
That's your meditation.

730
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,560
That's your repulsion and that's your sum.

731
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,560
Yeah, this how it says there.

732
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,560
It's there.

733
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
It's the same thing.

734
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,560
It's holding with mindfulness while basically the right order of things

735
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:13,560
being established through our thinking.

736
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,560
I don't know if this topic is going to turn out to be exactly related,

737
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:23,560
but it's using some of the same terminology we've been kind of thinking about.

738
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,560
You've mentioned a lot of times the consciousness being external

739
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,560
with the objects as both to thinking, oh my consciousness is here.

740
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,560
I just kind of trying to think about that.

741
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,560
It's not to say that you do need the sense base for there to be.

742
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,560
Yeah, I see the problem.

743
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,560
I mean, I said that in a very well-defined context.

744
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,560
And that context was basically...

745
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,560
It's not a level of objects that you see.

746
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,560
It's on the level with the matter is because of which there are objects that you can see.

747
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,560
And you're not seeing the matter.

748
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,560
But when people don't know, when people still have assumption and conceive

749
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,560
is that they're seeing that which matter is.

750
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,560
I'm looking at the cup and that's where the matter of the cup is.

751
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,560
Like I'm seeing the matter.

752
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,560
I'm not seeing my perception.

753
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,560
Then they would think I'm just saying consciousness is out there with that cup.

754
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,560
Which again,

755
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,560
could actually aid somebody in right thinking,

756
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,560
even if they say it wrongly.

757
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,560
If they investigate further, they'll find out, okay, surely it's not with the cup.

758
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,560
But it's with the matter of the cup.

759
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,560
Which obviously I have perception in regard to because of, but I can't perceive it.

760
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,560
Which means you can't even exist consciousness like that.

761
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,560
But it belongs.

762
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,560
It's oriented from the point of view of the matter,

763
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,560
not from your point of view of the inside of whatever you assume.

764
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,560
When you say that, that kind of gave me a start.

765
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,560
Matter, it could be like this matter, that matter.

766
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,560
I'm not obviously just needing what is actually matter,

767
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,560
but like the base or the other, if they're both matter,

768
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,560
consciousness is saying it's on that level.

769
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,560
Yes, external.

770
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,560
Yes, because that matter is external.

771
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,560
Consisting is bound with it.

772
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,560
Okay, that clarifies.

773
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,560
Because yeah, I was thinking, like,

774
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,560
they're really with the cup.

775
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,560
Yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.

776
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,560
No, you would just be basically like,

777
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,560
well, I'm sure they were using philosophy,

778
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,560
they were just saying consciousness in our day.

779
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,560
And I mean, my even, even in existentialism,

780
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,560
such, they were saying,

781
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,560
but obviously it was quite clear.

782
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,560
But the way he would put it,

783
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,560
was intentionality is out there with the things.

784
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,560
And in a way, that's true.

785
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,560
Because then that out there,

786
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,560
oh, that means basically this inside is internal of me.

787
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,560
It comes out there.

788
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,560
It comes because of the things.

789
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,560
You can have these thoughts about,

790
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,560
oh, I'm going to do this and this and this with that.

791
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,560
And that thing over there,

792
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,560
only because those things are already given.

793
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,560
But it doesn't need to be qualified,

794
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,560
because it's too easily assumed.

795
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,560
It's too complex to be just put in one sentence,

796
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,560
without it being misunderstood by somebody

797
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,560
who's coming from the point of view of wrong views.

798
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,560
Compossibly, just get that right.

799
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,560
No, I think that clearly

800
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,560
seems quite clear.

801
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,560
So next time.

802
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,560
Yeah, sure.

803
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,560
Doesn't even say,

804
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
it's the same time also,

805
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,560
it's not obviously the matter,

806
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,560
it's conscious, so to say,

807
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,560
it's consciousness, it's conscious.

808
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,560
Is that so?

809
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,560
But they need each other.

810
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,560
No, really.

811
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,560
That's the ultimate thing.

812
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,560
No.

813
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,560
That's when you really use the word juxtaposed,

814
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,560
when you came to consciousness and the matter.

815
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,560
They're not even connected.

816
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:53,560
They're just placed side by side for no reason.

817
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,560
And that's a whole life.

818
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,560
No reason to.

819
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,560
No reason, no preparation.

820
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,560
No preparation or suffering.

821
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,560
But like, you need the eye in a certain state

822
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,560
for there to be visual conscious, no?

823
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,560
Like, yes.

824
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,560
Like, stab my eyes.

825
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,560
There's not going to be that conscious anymore.

826
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,560
Yeah, sure.

827
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,560
Well, look, they won't be under the matter.

828
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,560
And then the consciousness won't be their idea.

829
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,560
You can't have a pair side by side

830
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,560
if one of the pair is missing.

831
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,560
So you're saying they're a pair,

832
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,560
but...

833
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
Jack's supposed.

834
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,560
They're not in the same footing.

835
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,560
They're just there.

836
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,560
And again, you can don't think they're in space.

837
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,560
They're not sitting there next to you on the fire branch,

838
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,560
talking to each other.

839
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,560
There's completely Jack's supposed.

840
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,560
Everywhere and nowhere.

841
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,560
So to speak, because you can't put it in space.

842
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,560
One of the actors is Jack's supposed.

843
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,560
Is Jack's supposed to superimpose?

844
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,560
Well, see, like superimposed,

845
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,560
kind of implies a direction.

846
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,560
Superimposed.

847
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,560
Superimposed doesn't.

848
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,560
Is this place side by side?

849
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,560
And the result of that placement

850
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,560
is the whole rising manifestation

851
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,560
of the fire ivy ex

852
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,560
of the ore of Namhoopa.

853
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,560
That placement is removed.

854
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:20,560
And you can't even conceive that Jack's supposed relationship.

855
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,560
You can discern it right away,

856
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,560
but you can't actually access it,

857
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,560
because it's way below your feet and always moving.

858
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,560
So then you recognize

859
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,560
that the entire experience that you have,

860
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,560
as you just said,

861
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,560
all you need to do is have your eyes removed.

862
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,560
And it's gone.

863
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,560
The whole domain of vision,

864
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,560
everything you ever seen,

865
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,560
everything you ever would have seen,

866
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,560
everything you ever experienced,

867
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,560
any feelings you experience,

868
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
an account of things you've seen,

869
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
thoughts, plans,

870
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
happiness, sadness,

871
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
for eons and eons of lifetimes,

872
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
and that's it.

873
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,560
Your eyes have been removed.

874
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,560
The whole vision's gone.

875
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,560
But just the thing is,

876
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,560
then you're reborn again.

877
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,560
Right, yeah.

878
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,560
It was using us like just trying to get the terms.

879
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,560
Yeah.

880
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,560
And you can't even,

881
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,560
you can't take possession

882
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
of that relationship,

883
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,560
which means you're just borrowing.

884
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,560
You're just basically a user

885
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,560
of that which doesn't belong to you,

886
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,560
yet you use it as if it is you want.

887
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:44,560
Eyes, nose, ears, tongue, body, thoughts.

888
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,560
But because of which those things are,

889
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:55,560
you can't possibly access or have or influence.

890
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,560
Is this just completely inaccessible for my redirection?

891
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,560
You're taking the answer.

892
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,560
Thank you.

893
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,560
Just writing your eyes and stories,

894
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,560
and then don't mind the prince of it.

895
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,560
Oh yeah, sure, sure, sure.

896
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,560
I'm just referring to the actual,

897
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,560
the whole, the circumstantial nature of it,

898
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,560
inaccessible, which means all you know is,

899
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,560
it's not going to be.

900
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,560
It is, but it's not going to be.

901
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,560
No, not being for me.

902
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,560
That's for sure.

903
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,560
Exactly.

904
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,560
Yeah.

905
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,560
So you don't want to overshure the mark,

906
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,560
but you certainly must not undershoot it either.

907
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,560
And by that I mean,

908
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,560
you don't want to start conceiving the access

909
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,560
to that because of which your vision is there,

910
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,560
to that because of which

911
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:48,560
you smell, taste, sounds, touch, thoughts are there.

912
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,560
By not conceiving the access,

913
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,560
you stop maintaining the wrong assumptions.

914
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,560
You don't fade out.

915
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,560
And then, in the scene, there is just a scene,

916
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,560
in the house, there is just a head, and so on.

917
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,560
So just to clarify my own head

918
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,560
isn't going to be repeating probably things.

919
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,560
That's fine.

920
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,560
Matter and consciousness paired,

921
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,560
but entirely different.

922
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,560
Not connected.

923
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Not connected.

924
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,560
But it's there, like they're paired together,

925
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,560
but not connected in any way.

926
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,560
It just happens to be in that.

927
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,560
Yeah.

928
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:31,560
And result of that complete circumstantial checks the posing

929
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,560
is your whole existence.

930
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,560
And it always was, no matter of the realm,

931
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,560
no matter of the river.

932
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,560
That was always the case,

933
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,560
for devils, for animals.

934
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,560
Nobody's exempt from it.

935
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,560
Yet, it's complete circumstantial.

936
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,560
I feel like you could drill something in that,

937
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,560
but still have plenty of assumptions about other things.

938
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,560
Yeah, you just need to drill it longer,

939
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,560
until it saturates everything else.

940
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,560
That's fine.

941
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:31,560
I feel like you could drill something in that,

942
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,560
you could drill something in that.

943
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,560
You could drill something in that.

944
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,560
You could drill something in that.

945
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,560
It's a matter of consciousness.

946
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,560
It's a matter of consciousness.

947
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,560
It's about the domain of Peter, either.

948
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,560
He's very good.

949
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,560
He said that once, like he can't say,

950
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,560
when his letters in other years,

951
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,560
he said, like, he can't say consciousness of consciousness.

952
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,560
Like people use word consciousness.

953
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,560
Every day, people will not come by consciousness.

954
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,560
How many of them include yourself?

955
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,560
What do you refer to when you say consciousness?

956
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,560
Final.

957
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,560
Clarified.

958
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,560
Has the Buddha said in the Suhrer so many times,

959
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,560
don't believe many, many are unturned?

960
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,560
Investigate the meaning, interrogate yourself,

961
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,560
until things are clear.

962
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:30,560
And again, not for the purpose of intellectual satisfaction,

963
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:34,560
but for the purpose of full freedom from suffering.

964
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,560
Because if this interrogate, self interrogation,

965
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,560
and you're asking the meaning is done,

966
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,560
on the basis of the mindfulness of the experience at all,

967
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,560
then the knowledge will result from freedom from suffering.

968
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,560
It cannot be any other way.

969
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,560
Clarified.

970
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,560
We say that we can discern consciousness

971
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,560
because things appear, like we can't see it.

972
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,560
You can know that it's there.

973
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,560
Yes.

974
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,560
But it is very important that,

975
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,560
no matter what contemplation doing,

976
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,560
writing it down, thinking and pondering,

977
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,560
to do it on the basis of the mindfulness of the experience at all.

978
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,560
And that can be established on almost anything,

979
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,560
general, and you discern things with it,

980
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,560
with it, with it.

981
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,560
Sure, but it can.

982
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,560
Ask your knowledge.

983
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,560
Yes.

984
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,560
Hold on, I'm just here, present in this room on double downhill

985
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,560
in the central province,

986
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,560
on the island, surrounded by the ocean,

987
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,560
on the planet Earth.

988
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,560
That's all true.

989
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,560
In the universe.

990
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,560
In the universe.

991
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,560
In the expanse.

992
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,560
And the personal general does,

993
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,560
it does appear,

994
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,560
not like consciousness, that true.

995
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,560
Yes, it appears.

996
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,560
But obviously peripheral appears

997
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,560
to less detect the intensity of the actual.

998
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,560
But it's different than the relation

999
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,560
between consciousness and others.

1000
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,560
Yes.

1001
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,560
The consciousness is the dead direction from which

1002
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,560
where peripheral is then found.

1003
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,560
So the ultimate peripheral is the peripheral of the dead

1004
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,560
of the earth, which is peripheral of consciousness.

1005
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,560
The ultimate negative.

1006
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,560
Exactly.

1007
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:44,560
When we establish the awareness

1008
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,560
of something perishable,

1009
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,560
then it's my way.

1010
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,560
It's not the same thing,

1011
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,560
it's just completely forgetting about it.

1012
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,560
But it still has to be there to some degree,

1013
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,560
but then there's...

1014
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,560
Well, that's how mindfulness is properly established,

1015
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,560
but it's really.

1016
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,560
The actual mindfulness is not mindfulness.

1017
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,560
It's going...

1018
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,560
So the mindfulness is...

1019
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,560
That's where mindfulness is established

1020
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,560
on the peripheral level.

1021
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,560
Hence, people are not aware of peripheral,

1022
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,560
and not mindful.

1023
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,560
But it's still kept in mind,

1024
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,560
even though it's peripheral.

1025
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,560
Yes, that's what it means.

1026
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,560
Like, you don't...

1027
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,560
You don't need to keep the peripheral in mind.

1028
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,560
Peripheral is already there.

1029
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,560
Hence, by discerning it,

1030
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,560
you become mindful.

1031
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,560
It's actually, by knowing the peripheral,

1032
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,560
you become mindful.

1033
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,560
You can't unknow it.

1034
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,560
You're not doing it.

1035
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,560
You might be doing it in the beginning

1036
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,560
because you don't know how to do it,

1037
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,560
and then you try to do it,

1038
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,560
which is what you're doing.

1039
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,560
But by discerning the peripheral,

1040
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,560
you are mindful of it.

1041
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,560
That's mindfulness.

1042
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,560
That's what it is.

1043
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,560
So simply by knowing the peripheral

1044
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,560
level,

1045
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,560
if I'm sitting in the coody,

1046
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,560
you could think of that as,

1047
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,560
look at that peripherally.

1048
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,560
When you're saying, actually,

1049
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,560
it's not like actual versus imaginary.

1050
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,560
It's present peripherally.

1051
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,560
Like, I'm in the coody.

1052
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,560
No, not in a sense of imaginary.

1053
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,560
Oh, okay.

1054
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,560
Like, you're thinking,

1055
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,560
I'm sitting in the chair now.

1056
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,560
I'm sitting in this chair.

1057
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,560
That's actually the front.

1058
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,560
Yeah, it's basically what you're attending right there right now

1059
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,560
in front of you.

1060
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,560
By then, the presence of the chair,

1061
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,560
the presence of your body, the body posture,

1062
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,560
the room,

1063
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,560
the anterior,

1064
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,560
the normal type of vehicle,

1065
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,560
the health, the element of the earth,

1066
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,560
all those peripheral,

1067
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,560
that your mind can discern

1068
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,560
and become established upon.

1069
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,560
So, that doesn't mean

1070
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,560
you become completely oblivious to the actual.

1071
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,560
No, that means

1072
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,560
you make that

1073
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,560
new peripheral,

1074
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,560
sorry, you make that peripheral a new actual.

1075
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,560
No, it means you're mindful

1076
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,560
of that peripheral in regard to

1077
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,560
whatever happened to be actual.

1078
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,560
So, again, is that relationship?

1079
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,560
Two simultaneous,

1080
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,560
present things, peripheral and actual.

1081
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,560
I don't think you could actually even forget the actual.

1082
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,560
You could actually even forget the actual

1083
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,560
entirely if that's been actual.

1084
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,560
Exactly.

1085
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,560
Exactly, that's the whole point.

1086
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,560
When you recognize that you

1087
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,560
can't forget it,

1088
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,560
that's like the other meeting mindfulness

1089
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,560
and even the act of forgetting

1090
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,560
your mind full of.

1091
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,560
And then the act of remembering

1092
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,560
your mind full of.

1093
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,560
There's no any more

1094
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,560
any induction of ignorance in regard to those things.

1095
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,560
It's impossible.

1096
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,560
It's going to be the one percent

1097
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,560
of either actual or at least one percent

1098
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,560
of either peripheral,

1099
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,560
kind of 100 percent of all.

1100
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,560
So, that one percent is

1101
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,560
more than enough

1102
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:32,560
to establish your mindfulness.
