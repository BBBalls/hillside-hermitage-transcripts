00:00.000 --> 00:12.880
Give this from me and good to Danikai to call this enchantment, because these five things

00:12.880 --> 00:20.680
when developed and cultivated lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation,

00:20.680 --> 00:25.400
to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbana.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.400
What five?

00:26.400 --> 00:32.280
Here, Bikudwell is contemplating the unattractiveness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness

00:32.280 --> 00:39.120
of food, perceiving non-delight in the entire world, contemplating impermanence in all

00:39.120 --> 00:47.480
conditions phenomena, and he has the perception of death well-established eternally, internally.

00:47.480 --> 00:53.520
These five things when developed and cultivated lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion,

00:53.520 --> 01:02.040
to peace, to acknowledge, and admire, and this is a game from the enchantment, and what

01:02.040 --> 01:05.440
an under is the perception of unattractiveness.

01:05.440 --> 01:11.440
Here, Bikudwell reviews this body upward from the souls of the feet, and downward from the

01:11.440 --> 01:18.840
tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin as full of many kinds of impurities.

01:18.840 --> 01:23.840
They are in this body, hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,

01:23.840 --> 01:30.160
senus, bone, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, intestines, stomach, excrement,

01:30.160 --> 01:37.440
bile, fem, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, breath, saliva, snuck, fluid, the joints, and urine.

01:37.440 --> 01:42.360
Thus, he dwells contemplating unattractiveness in the body, this is called perception of

01:42.360 --> 01:43.360
unattractiveness.

01:43.360 --> 01:53.360
He says, this is in regard to the supermeditation, meditation on the unattractiveness, and you

01:53.360 --> 02:02.360
said, yesterday, you were talking about it, and you said that establishing one's mind

02:02.360 --> 02:11.240
on a super, and then making it in urine without losing sight of the peripheral of that

02:11.240 --> 02:20.240
super, even when sensual inclination is present internally or externally, but maybe

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
so.

02:21.240 --> 02:31.240
Well, it comes down to the main point of that is basically you cannot be attracted and

02:31.240 --> 02:36.280
repelt by the same thing at the same time.

02:36.280 --> 02:44.400
So if that which attracts you, repels you, then you repelt the attraction will cease.

02:44.400 --> 02:51.120
So that's important thing to realize, because when you read out the bit from Angutanika,

02:51.120 --> 02:57.920
what is the Buddha recommends like reviewing your body in terms of what is made of, it's

02:57.920 --> 03:04.280
very easy to do that wrongly, in a sense of you keep bringing the new things, new objects

03:04.280 --> 03:10.880
of your perceptions into your mind, and then trying to kind of sort of generate a sense

03:10.880 --> 03:15.840
of disgust and dispassion.

03:15.840 --> 03:22.280
But the point is not to find things that are disgusting as a replacement to things that

03:22.280 --> 03:23.280
are attractive.

03:23.280 --> 03:29.200
The point is to see things that are attractive as underlined by a disgusting things, by things

03:29.200 --> 03:32.320
that are repelling, by things that are non-attractive.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.840
So you need to see the simultaneously present there just on a different level.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.920
Because it's easily, you can easily force yourself to not look at the attractive and just

03:40.920 --> 03:44.720
focus on non-attractive, but sooner or later when you're tired, when your mindfulness

03:44.720 --> 03:51.080
lapses, when attractive arises again, you have no protection against it, because all

03:51.080 --> 03:56.560
you're used to is doing the sort of replacing it and pushing it away and getting the non-attractive

03:56.560 --> 03:59.000
because you were told that's what you need to do.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.480
Well, actually, whenever said you need to replace it, you say you need to see it.

04:02.480 --> 04:06.600
You need to see it in relation to that which is attractive.

04:06.600 --> 04:11.120
So when you're reviewing your body, for example, to get that sense of dispassion because

04:11.120 --> 04:22.520
it's all the organs by themselves are not quite repulsive actually and certainly non-attractive.

04:22.520 --> 04:28.040
So that's easily seen, but what it's hard to see is that when you're attracted, either

04:28.040 --> 04:34.760
towards gaining physical pleasure, towards pursuing the objects of physical pleasure externally,

04:34.760 --> 04:39.520
you want to see that all of those experiences of centrality, basically, is fundamentally

04:39.520 --> 04:45.800
inseparable from these disgusting organs and fundamentally established upon them so they

04:45.800 --> 04:48.480
can never be apart from them.

04:48.480 --> 04:54.520
They can never be independent of the repulsive foundations, which means that themselves

04:54.520 --> 04:57.440
can never be really truly attractive.

04:57.440 --> 05:03.360
So a person who is truly experienced dispassion and developed it, for them things are very

05:03.360 --> 05:10.360
dispassionate and maybe slightly less dispassionate or rather very unattractive and slightly less unattractive.

05:10.360 --> 05:14.240
Sensuality, the beautiful things become slightly less unattractive so you can still recognize

05:14.240 --> 05:17.880
the beauty, but none of it is the attractive beauty they would induce centrality.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.600
It's endlessly less ugly.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
Exactly.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
So it's ugly and less ugly.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
Yeah.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
It comes down to that.

05:23.600 --> 05:28.120
It's ugly and beautiful that you're just trying to kind of revolve around, but in order

05:28.120 --> 05:37.600
to see the beautiful as ugly, is you need to see that it's simultaneously and inseparably

05:37.600 --> 05:44.280
bound up with those repulsive aspects that are kind of inseparable from inescapable from.

05:44.280 --> 05:50.120
So that's why once the mind is experienced truly dispassion, that order of which comes

05:50.120 --> 05:53.560
first ugly or beautiful cannot be changed anymore.

05:53.560 --> 05:59.200
The beautiful cannot step outside of ugly ever again and assume its own privileged kind

05:59.200 --> 06:02.040
of sensual existence.

06:02.040 --> 06:06.160
That's how sensuality ceases as well, when it becomes fully enclosed in ugly and you

06:06.160 --> 06:14.280
lose entire dispassion for any aspect of sensuality conceivable, possible.

06:14.280 --> 06:19.480
Because in its nature you've seen it's just inconceivable without the basis of ugly and

06:19.480 --> 06:20.480
such.

06:20.480 --> 06:26.480
It's ugly in itself, unattractive or repulsive.

06:26.480 --> 06:33.960
You see the danger in sensuality, you would have to then see the danger in you.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.360
The danger becomes apparent once this passion has been developed, otherwise you can't grasp

06:39.360 --> 06:40.360
the danger.

06:40.360 --> 06:47.880
But once you experience this passion in the mind is truly sort of withdrawn from the perversion

06:47.880 --> 06:52.080
of perception which is what sensuality is, perceiving an ugly is beautiful and it sees

06:52.080 --> 06:58.360
it for what it is ugly and just slightly less ugly, but equally not wanted.

06:58.360 --> 07:03.680
Then you recognize, wow, what a danger it is to actually keep focusing on the less ugly

07:03.680 --> 07:07.600
and regarding is beautiful because it keeps you bound to the entire thing that is subject

07:07.600 --> 07:14.720
to this complete annihilation eventually, sickness, aging and death and then repeat and again

07:14.720 --> 07:16.360
and again.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.680
It's because of that tiny little perversion.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.920
Just because of your tiny little assumption in thinking that sensual, that beautiful

07:23.920 --> 07:31.360
objects of senses can exist separate from the repulsive, non-attractive, disgusting

07:31.360 --> 07:36.240
foundations that they are.

07:36.240 --> 07:42.360
That's why it's important not to keep contemplating the repulsive kind of before or after or trying

07:42.360 --> 07:47.840
to replace the beautiful sensual thoughts with it, you want to see them, so you need to

07:47.840 --> 07:51.280
contemplate but you need to see it at the same time.

07:51.280 --> 07:55.320
So yes, think about the repulsive things of the body so that you can experience this

07:55.320 --> 07:59.560
passion, but then you have to apply or rather maintain that this passion, that's why

07:59.560 --> 08:05.480
perception must learn how to endure, even when sensuality arises whereby you don't

08:05.480 --> 08:10.200
just jump on sensuality and try to get rid of it, because that wasn't what you were doing

08:10.200 --> 08:11.200
to begin with.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.520
What you're doing is whether you choose to abandon attending the foundations of that

08:15.520 --> 08:20.680
sensuality and give to rise to attending pleasing and like temporarily sort of particular

08:20.680 --> 08:29.680
features of it, which is basically how sensual thoughts originate and get maintained.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.640
So you don't want to keep replacing sensuality, you want to see through it.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.480
So all of those things that the disgusting contemplations and so on that the Buddha

08:38.480 --> 08:44.000
was encouraging, amongst the do, need to be seen through the sensual, through the beautiful

08:44.000 --> 08:47.200
objects, through the beautiful things.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
Not instead.

08:48.200 --> 08:57.040
So you're not saying it once you're going, trying to seek out beautiful sights.

08:57.040 --> 09:02.360
Oh no, on the contrary, no, no, no, no, yeah, exactly, well if you are seeking out a bit

09:02.360 --> 09:06.120
of sight, there is no establishment of the right, that means the perception is already

09:06.120 --> 09:11.720
perverted, which means the mind is not seeing, not attending to the roots of this passion,

09:11.720 --> 09:18.160
roots of disgusting aspects of that sensuality, because you don't, you don't need to, you

09:18.160 --> 09:23.280
need to restrain the senses first, fully, stop giving into the habit of seeking pleasure

09:23.280 --> 09:29.960
by default, for these roots to be able to be seen through the a risen sensual prospect

09:29.960 --> 09:33.920
in a form of thought or a possibility or intention.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.360
But if your intention habitually leads you to immediately give in to the action by your

09:37.360 --> 09:42.640
senses and seek out the pleasure, no amount of transparency in through it will be possible

09:42.640 --> 09:46.000
because you just, you just went off, went off with it.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.960
So yeah, that's something people think, oh, I must expose myself sensuality, but if

09:49.960 --> 09:55.480
you need to prove to yourself that your free from sensuality means you don't know it,

09:55.480 --> 09:59.200
means you doubt it, which means you're not free, if the doubt can enter it, there is

09:59.200 --> 10:01.320
no freedom there.

10:01.320 --> 10:08.320
And in the same sense, in order to be able to seek sensuality even as a proof, it requires

10:08.320 --> 10:13.440
perversion of perception, it requires central perceptions to be established, which means

10:13.440 --> 10:20.440
even if you're seeking out to prove it yourself means you're seeking out of sensuality.

10:20.440 --> 10:26.440
So no seeking out, seeking out whatsoever and then seeing through whatever present, however

10:26.440 --> 10:30.960
it's present, how it will be beautiful it might be, you see it inseparable from those

10:30.960 --> 10:37.720
ugly aspects that you have been contemplating, because they are there.

10:37.720 --> 10:44.640
Because the sensuality, the sensual beauty is actually ugly and disgusting and inseparable

10:44.640 --> 10:49.640
from disgusting things, unattractive things, that's why freedom from sensuality is possible.

10:49.640 --> 10:55.720
If it were truly beautiful and independent, you wouldn't be able to go out of it, but

10:55.720 --> 10:59.600
then it wouldn't be a problem either, you wouldn't have to go out of it, but it's not

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
truly beautiful.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.680
It's a mistake based on ignorance, based on sensual craving, based on the fire of lust

11:04.680 --> 11:07.320
and so on, so that's why it's a problem.

11:07.320 --> 11:11.360
That's why pleasure underlying by craving is a problem, pleasure without underlying craving

11:11.360 --> 11:15.840
is not a problem, but there is no sensual pleasure that it's not underlined by desire for

11:15.840 --> 11:45.400
more lust and greed and craving.
