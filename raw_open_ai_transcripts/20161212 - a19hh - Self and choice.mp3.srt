1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,480
So, as I was saying before, in terms of the sense of self, to what you are trying to do

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:29,360
it is invariably, but once you become established in terms of mindfulness or the experience as

3
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,240
a whole, as you said, which sort of reveals this sense of self has kind of separated from it.

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:44,240
If you get established in terms of practice knowing that you are not supposed to, that it's actually

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,480
impossible to bring that background sense of self, that ambiguous sense of self, to bring

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,360
it forward, to bring it front of you to see, because then something else will be the

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
very unfair.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,680
So, when you kind of give up these futile attempts, based on these wrong habits of expecting

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,640
to get it in front of you, expect it to last bit, then that sense of self can become

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,200
the option for mindfulness itself.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,000
If you're sensing incorrectly that background sense of self, that sense of I am, because

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,360
it is in a way more general than everything else, it's just that once you have discerned

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,040
the principle that it's actually fully determined by whatever you have put in front of you in

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,800
that experience as a whole, the fully depends upon it, that it's inconceivable without

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,720
same like the dependence of number of being out of the number of being out of the number

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
of being.

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,320
Then, just enough to have the sense of self, you don't need to then, in the beginning

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,240
you have to, but then you don't need to look for these determinations, even along the

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
right lines.

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Why?

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Because then, by then, it becomes apparent that whatever has a reason, that's why it's

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,560
apparent, so then you start seeing impermanence in simple things, in simple fact that things

23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
have manifest.

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,920
No matter how big is how much or background, how much, it's impossible to kind of grasp

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,560
them, hold them, close and inspect them.

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,720
The fact that it's appeared in any shape of form, distant, big is removed, whatever, it's

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
apparent.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Because it has the beginning, by necessity, implies the end or other ending is the

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
end.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
What is the meaning of the beginning?

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
What does it mean?

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
That it wasn't.

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,520
One of its meaning could be, if I say, well, what does it reveal basically?

34
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
What does it reveal?

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Sure, that's me.

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:46,720
If it wasn't before, because if it wasn't before, it cannot be an internal self, because

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,720
if it weren't, then the self wouldn't have been there all the time.

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,360
The less it feels, the internal self feels.

39
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,360
You can't, you know, so back, you can't remember, kind of here, but that whole, that whole

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,720
of a large thing is a concept.

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,080
That can't be done in this presence, and that's what I told you, that if you were to

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,480
not, you're not supposed to give the rid of that sense of I am, you're just supposed

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:23,720
to undermine its gratuitous notion of permanence, of being constant.

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,920
So you have experience as a whole, and then you have that background sense of self, the

45
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,680
people can mystify, or, well, whatever, they're not mystically called it observer, or

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,160
pure awareness, pristine awareness, or whatever new age it turns you might come up with,

47
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,200
the fact is there is that thing, there is a background, that you cannot have in the

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
fund.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,680
There is the observer of the observed, and that's not the problem.

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,960
The problem is that you still assume, imply the permanence associated with that observer,

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,560
no matter how far you mystify it, what words you use, the fact that you regard it, he has

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,600
a notion of mind to it, or real, or more control, more of a center of experience.

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,120
So you're not interfering with that, whatever you want to call it, but you want to interfere

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,320
with it, is that the truth is notion of permanence associated with it, and how interfered

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,960
with it, the only way you can do it is indirectly by seeing it inseparable from that which is permanent,

56
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,960
sorry, which is impermanent, which is fully understood as something that will have to

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,960
cease, when you then, through the, like, literally, fabrication through your efforts, you kind

58
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,200
of establish, you force upon the dependence of that observer, inverted commas, quote unquote

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:48,040
observer, if you just, like, force that the dependence upon that which is observed, then

60
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:56,640
the dependence will become revealed, why? Because there is genuine dependence of the two,

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,320
and through emulating it, first, simply based on the external advice, through emulating

62
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,600
the dependence, then it will become apparent eventually, why? Because it becomes apparent

63
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,600
only after a sufficient number of times, after it's been repeated, a number of times,

64
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,200
basically, as long as it takes, something that takes more, something that takes less.

65
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,880
So once you've been repeating this principle that your doctrine of faith externally, as

66
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,080
a true principle whereby observer is determined by that which is being observed, it's inseparable

67
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,960
from it, it cannot be conceived apart from it. If you keep emulating that, because there

68
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,640
is the actual nature of things, then it will become apparent. So it's like, it's complete,

69
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,640
it's complete darkness in the beginning, and somebody just tells you to keep repeating

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,640
these steps, they will eventually bring the light, but initially, you don't know.

71
00:05:51,640 --> 00:06:00,320
What's the point of that, like, if you see certain things, external things are not in your

72
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:09,000
control, like, you get your body, whatever, the weather, so if you, or the bus game, time

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
or people liking you, your reputation is only in control, then if you truly see that

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
your reputation is only in control, if you find out that people are speaking bad about

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you, then you're not necessarily going to get upset, because you throw any contemplative

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
bit out of my control, and they could say good things, they could say bad things, but

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that's when they say bad things, they're not referring to the mind as withdrawn from

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
that domain. So when you realize that you're all, they're very sense of self,

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
there's not any other control, your mind is withdrawn from that.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But what about the view that they've been able to, your attitude towards things, like

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the game, your attitude towards things, which is dependent on things being there, other

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
things, I mean?

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Would you go beyond that view as well?

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Actually, beyond your control.

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The other hand.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Again, the noble evil path, in the case of another hand,

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
they added another, which is basically beyond...

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What was the...

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He was going beyond the views.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Car intention right after that, it goes on, on, on, on.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And then, basically, it's beyond.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How did he go that sort of the last two?

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What was it?

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's the ten factors, ten.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, a capture, for example, basically.

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The noble path becomes ten.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, it was basically...

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, it's clearly indicated, okay, the...

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And Arya Sava, of any form,

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
still has a degree of review.

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And for another hand, he fully overcomes even the views as well.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So good beyond the views.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And that's what our entrepreneurs do.

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So that's exactly it.

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yet, the view is, like, you can see very much as a law,

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
as an eternal law, as an impersonal law,

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
as a law that doesn't subject to anything, kind of,

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
from the physical law.

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But actually, it's inseparable from it.

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In its phenomenological nature,

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
it would not be there if things had not arisen

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
beforehand on a counter, which you have developed a view.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So now, the view might seem independent of it.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But the fact is, if the matter in its entirety disappears,

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you can remain old in the view.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Given the right view.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right, the wrong view.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So then you go beyond the view.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When you see fully abandoning that subtle depends on the view.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The view?

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Like, a person can't go beyond...

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You can't see that you're choosing.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, no, going beyond the view doesn't mean finding some area

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
beyond the view, which you then inhabit.

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
However, going beyond the view means abandoning the view.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Abandoning depends on the view.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
In the same sense, you said...

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
For the view?

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you true...

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, yeah.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But then it's easy to be the view.

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The direction is still there, but it's easy to be the view.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The view is, for as long as you are taking it up.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So it's the same thing as you just said.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you contemplate that praise is out of your control,

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and you truly abandon it, then the blame will not affect you.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you contemplate the view...

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Views are fully a reason based on their reason things before,

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and then you fully abandon that as well.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So it doesn't mean they never appear.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It just means they'll never be yours.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It means they'll never be manifested as views.

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because using the word view implies my point of view,

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
my direction, my take on things, or whatever.

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How subtle it may be, the point is to go beyond it,

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
which means the mind is not established on it either.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Third.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In any way.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So going beyond the view does not mean going into the realm of transcendental existence.

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It means mind letting go of the view as well.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Depending.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But truly letting go of the view, not all letting go of the views now.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Like fully developing this principle of simultaneous dependence that I've been talking about,

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
to a full extent whereby even the subtlety of views is announced,

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is announced as yours.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
As as as as as as like a center of mind, everything is just completely disowned.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And that comes with that.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So it's not about figuring out what's beyond the view.

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not about feeling what's behind this observer or where he comes from,

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
what he is or what can I paint it to.

165
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's all about seeing a no matter what it is as a background,

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
it will depend on the foreground.

167
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Or rather, it depends on the foreground, right there, right now.

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It depends not in a linear sense whereby one led to the number two,

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
but more like in the simultaneous sense where one detends is one.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So the presence of it is inseparable from this.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So if you hold, and as I said, it can be as general as mind and body.

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You don't have to necessarily pursue any more particular definitions.

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Mind and body, physical and mental, can call it that.

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
As I said, mental, you have to make this connection that's descended

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and then keep repeating them until they become apparent whereby you see that mind.

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No matter how independent it might seem, our mind might feel,

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
it's inseparable from the presence of the physical body, like inconceivable.

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, you can imagine physical body dying by the mind continuing.

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But that's like not falling from the final.

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It means that's not mindful thinking.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If you're mindful, you will see whenever there is a thought of you

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
as a whatever personality or mind or whatever,

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
there are implied images of your body or your matter or something.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Or something exactly like a light, like a space, like an eye.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Anything, and you realize that is matter.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That stands for what matter is.

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It does. I cannot even conceive.

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Anything mental without this matter already being there,

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
given before and simultaneously.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Any other way around as well, you realize that absolutely no matter how far out

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
into the matter you go, you realize this matter is inconceivable

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
if I'm not determining it, even mutually recognizing it.

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, recognizing it, and designation, recognition, everything,

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
that's all mental. That's all pertains to the mind.

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So, you realize, well, no matter, like I can truly examine

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the forms of all I'm examining is, the perception of that matter

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
can never be directly accessed in your experience.

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Your body cannot be accessed directly in your experience.

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So, it's always in regard to the body.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yet, it's that because of which your mind is there in the first place.

201
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I mean, if you look at, I think it's the same one.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If you look at choosing, because choosing is there.

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you don't get further than that.

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You look at choosing, and then you couldn't choose anything

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
if there wasn't these choices there.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Exactly.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So, even though you've got power, and you've got the power to choose

209
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
between good and bad, I wouldn't.

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Both are already there before, and the choice is given before,

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and which means the power of choice is fully determined

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
upon the things that are given before.

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
To free will is the same one I'm saying.

214
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

215
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like, it's free will, but there is a freedom to choose this or that.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But it's fully within the given parameters of choice,

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
which means it's fully imprisoned.

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not free free, because you can't create anything free.

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can only shift from left to right or whatever within

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
what that which is already given.

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So, you cannot even conceive stepping outside of it.

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Because stepping outside of it, usually people assume

224
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
it's either frame from choice, thus I don't engage in it,

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and there was another choice.

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah.

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Are you afraid from choosing is something that you chose?

228
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Or, then, why do you choose something over another?

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, I see that's your assumption that they would want

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to explain the choice, which means you want to take the control over the choice,

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
which means if you want to put a sentence or choice,

232
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
which means it's taken as yourself, comes from the assumption of the self.

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why do you choose something over the other?

234
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, I mean, I would, for what have I been like,

235
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
there's tenancies in one, there's only tenancies.

236
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, in a month.

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So, he said, couldn't you say there was a reason for it?

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, the thing is, see, the choice works in the same way,

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
like they were we spoke when I referred to it similarly

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
from the soldiers of, you know, the rain falls on the top of the mountain,

241
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
they're in the springs from the top of the mountain,

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
but then as they come down, they're getting bigger and bigger

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
because they collect more and more water,

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
then you have the pools, mountain pools filled with water.

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And they start overflowing, they fill out the lower pools and lower,

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and then you have the ocean, but all comes from the same water.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So, what you're asking now is only in the level of ocean.

248
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's all within the level of full development and then what did I choose?

249
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But basically, all of your choices that you're making

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
are kind of, well, they're all form of directions.

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Choice is a direction to choose, which means every particular direction

252
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
has been determined by more general directions.

253
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So, you can say, well, why did I choose right here?

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why did I choose this thing right here right now?

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And they were always going to be an element of kind of spontaneity.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
To a degree, sometimes more, sometimes less,

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
depending on how much people, but spontaneity is a very,

258
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
a very phenomenon, a circumstance, a chance.

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's a phenomenon that you can then choose to be the reason for your choice.

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But more importantly than that, why you choose particular things

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
is because of the stuff you chose in the past.

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So, now people, for example, like, you know,

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
there are many cases that I met,

264
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
where people who get inspired by the situation want to practice

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
with the situation, but they've been out in the low of,

266
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
for quite some time, accumulated things, accumulated people,

267
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
accumulated family and children.

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And now, they can't just choose to leave it all behind.

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's too much.

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So, then they say, well, obviously, it's not my fault

271
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
that I can't become a monk.

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, actually, it is.

273
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If you want to see it as a fault, it is a fault.

274
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why?

275
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Because of the 30 years beforehand,

276
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you've been choosing all the things they've been taking the away elsewhere.

277
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And you did not consider at the time when you wanted to find a wife

278
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and have children that, who knows, in about 10 years,

279
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I might despise it all.

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
In 15 years, I might want to leave and become a monk.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You didn't think that.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You just thought what your sense desire was dictating it.

283
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So often, people choose a determined by senses.

284
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because senses are independent of five animals,

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
simply, they just drag you left and right,

286
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and then you think you are choosing left or right

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
in terms of the beautiful sides, because you already given in

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
to the pressure of beautiful sides.

289
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Beautiful touches, agreeable tasteness.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So, that's most often the why people choose.

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Because they just take for granted the criteria of sense pleasure.

292
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
If you start contemplating that,

293
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
the danger in sense, you just stop choosing a sense pleasure.

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
When you stop choosing a sense pleasure, those pools will dry up.

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Bit by bit, and then they won't be filled anymore.

296
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So, there is the choice.

297
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So, if you want to find out why did I choose right this right now?

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Why did I choose that?

299
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, start looking back.

300
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What did you choose before and before?

301
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And I mean more general.

302
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I didn't mean in the linear sequence,

303
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
what I've chosen five minutes ago and 15 minutes ago.

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I mean, what did I choose to do in my life that led me to this point?

305
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So, if you say, why did I choose to go and live on top of a mountain now,

306
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
when I could have gone to a monk?

307
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, because at first I chose to become a monk.

308
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
10-11 years ago.

309
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Then I've chosen to come to Sri Lanka.

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Then I've chosen to find a more secluded place.

311
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Then I said, and now I have this particular choice that results out of that.

312
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So, in that sense, no matter how spontaneous the choice is,

313
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you are responsible for it because of the previous choices you made,

314
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
because of the previous choices you made,

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
because of the previous choices you made.

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So, all of the choices you made,

317
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
the options, so to speak, were given to you before and initially?

318
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You do choose the direction and within that direction,

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
you choose other directions and other directions.

320
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Something circumstance, accident, things happen,

321
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
but that's all part of the human realm.

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And that just shows you that no matter how evolution,

323
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
how evolutional your choices are,

324
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
they're always going to remain, well, out of your control.

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Because no matter what you chose, what you built,

326
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
what direction you took,

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
it cannot be taken away in one stroke of bad luck.

328
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But it's not like it's in someone else's control.

329
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No.

330
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Or something else's control.

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, that's when you project your sense of self,

332
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
that you can't let go of externalism

333
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and then you're assuming a goal.

334
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
A goal that meant, and then you pray,

335
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and then you become super-

336
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
or rather then you tap into the kind of natural incline superstitiousness of people,

337
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
which is basically praying to something external,

338
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
because you recognize that.

339
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You recognize the no matter how much effort you put,

340
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
how far you go, how carefully you choose,

341
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
everything can be taken away the next second from you,

342
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and destroyed.

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So what you do, because you don't know

344
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that you're supposed to let go of your own sense of self.

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You don't see that as the way out.

346
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You can't even conceive yourself, not being yours.

347
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So then you just end up projecting that sense of externalism.

348
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So you end up worshipping trees,

349
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
caves, stones, deities, whatever.

350
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Externally, through that sense of self,

351
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
as if exactly, you realize this is not in my control,

352
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
but you, by default, assume that it's in someone else's control,

353
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
or something else's control, which is still taking itself.

354
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Making assumptions.

355
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, so you become superstitious.

356
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If you don't believe it anywhere, you become like magical.

357
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You think, oh, if I step on my left foot first,

358
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
it's going to be a bad luck.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's just completely random.

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But it's still projected in the same external principle.

361
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But if I look back to why,

362
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
if I read off myself why I want you in this,

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and I look back in general,

364
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
or ever say the other day, it was like,

365
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
what do you choose?

366
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You choose what is pleasant.

367
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You choose what you think is pleasant.

368
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah, they would come down to the core, basically.

369
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You choose based on how you feel.

370
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What are you saying?

371
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Most often.

372
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You're craving for pleasure.

373
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The delight in pleasure is the reason.

374
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well, for doing many of the things you think.

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, it's not the reason for choice,

376
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
because choice is one of the other reasons.

377
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Like, not the reason.

378
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, it's not the reason.

379
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's not its origin.

380
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's just the reason why you choose certain choices.

381
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But the nature of choice remains regardless of the craving.

382
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Choice is one of the arguments.

383
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The intentions, Chetan, that's already choice.

384
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Everything is intentional.

385
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Everything is directional in that sense.

386
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So you just want the attention,

387
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
what intention you attend.

388
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So then the choice becomes down to attending to things.

389
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And that's why you would have often say,

390
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
he carefully attends.

391
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Not careless, because if you carelessly attend,

392
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
then you already start feeling a certain direction.

393
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So by the time the choices are kind of crystallized as options,

394
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
you're actually fully responsible

395
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
because you've been dwelling on those things in your mind.

396
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So if one somebody carelessly attends to the sign of beauty

397
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and ends up lasting after it,

398
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
he can't be surprised that then his choice

399
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
is about pursuing the central pleasure

400
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
or, okay, saying no to it,

401
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but there's nothing in between.

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
He can't say anything in between,

403
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
because it's all about centrality,

404
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
because his mind has been dwelling.

405
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And obviously, then he'll choose to pursue it.

406
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He's not strong enough to say no.

407
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The choice of no is present in everything.

408
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And that's when you realize that you can...

409
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You yourself can undermine everything as well.

410
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But this thing, that knowledge has to be presented to you.

411
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You need to know before and...

412
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes, you can't.

413
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Or there's a different way.

414
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, there's no there was a choice there.

415
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So your intentions...

416
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Your intentions become fueled by the simple attention

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
of what you attend more,

418
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
what you attend at the expense of what...

419
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And then those intentions then,

420
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
determined further down the line,

421
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
cause the forms of choices you made in your life.

422
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But if you were to know that,

423
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
if you just then...

424
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No matter what choices you made,

425
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
if it's like...

426
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Ah, the example I gave,

427
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
the man who wants to leave it all behind

428
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
but feels responsible for his family and he can't give it in.

429
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If he still doesn't give it to bad fate

430
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and if he still doesn't obscure the sense of guilt

431
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
that he himself wrote himself into that position,

432
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
if he starts to attend constantly

433
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
on the freedom from suffering,

434
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
on the Buddhist teaching of whatever,

435
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
soon and well,

436
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
eventually, maybe not soon,

437
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
but eventually he will build enough resolve

438
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
to leave it all behind.

439
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He just might take longer than somebody who doesn't

440
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and the family and kids and everything else.

441
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But they don't attempt it.

442
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
No, they just look at it.

443
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I want to do it right now,

444
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
but I can't do it because of my family

445
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and then they dishonor responsibility for it

446
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
as if it wasn't them who built that family

447
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and then they don't think about it anymore.

448
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And then they just cement,

449
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
cement it, like cement over it,

450
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
as if it's done.

451
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's all that I can't possibly do it

452
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
because of this,

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and I'm not responsible for any of it,

454
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
thus I'll just have to do what I can.

455
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But what I got,

456
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
was to see that the choice to leave it all behind

457
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
or freedom from the choice to be freedom suffering.

458
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The guy who's just living his life with it,

459
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
having a family with it.

460
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That choice appears.

461
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He doesn't, he doesn't just,

462
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
he doesn't know even to mention it.

463
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He just kind of is there.

464
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No, I'm talking about why would he choose that

465
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
or why he wouldn't choose that,

466
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
why he wouldn't be able to choose

467
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
which is right to us originally.

468
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's because he's either too weak in regard to it,

469
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
to such choice,

470
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
too weak to say that, too weak to stir himself up,

471
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I, too weak to accept the pain,

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
they would come with it initially,

473
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
too weak to see through the immediate pleasure that appears

474
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
as not fully gratifying,

475
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
because it's pleasant to be in the safety of your home

476
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and family,

477
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
but in a long run, it's more dangerous.

478
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But he's too weak to see any of that,

479
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
because he's not attending to it on a daily basis.

480
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yet, if he was to not give in

481
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
to that kind of cover-up of his own guilt

482
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
for his own choices,

483
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
cover-up of his own responsibility for his own choices,

484
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
he would be able to keep dwelling on it,

485
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
to attend to it.

486
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And if he does attend sufficiently,

487
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
there won't be no amount of children

488
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
of family to keep you in their life

489
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
if you recognize the true danger of human existence,

490
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
the peril of it.

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I mean, you know, the sisters,

492
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
there were people who just saw through it

493
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
who were like about to become kings, the queens,

494
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
with everything laid out for them,

495
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
like what everybody would just wish for.

496
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yet, they were like disgusted with the whole thing

497
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and left it the next moment.

498
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Now, he said, well, can't I leave it the next moment?

499
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Well, whenever you leave it,

500
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
it's going to be left the next moment,

501
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
because that's how leaving works.

502
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Why you can't reach to the next moment

503
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
when you leave things is because

504
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
you haven't been building it up,

505
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and you build it up through simply attending to things.

506
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So, you're only someone I seek at the proper attention,

507
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and it's like the root of everything.

508
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That's what you're saying.

509
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And you can't know about those things you need to be attending to,

510
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
without...

511
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh, yeah.

512
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah.

513
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Without good friends.

514
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So, without somebody telling you what you need to attend to.

515
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So, that's what it's like.

516
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That they're good friends.

517
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's not in your control.

518
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Like, they might be out there, but you know.

519
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh, yeah.

520
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You don't have anything like that.

521
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, that's what I said.

522
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Like, I can't choose.

523
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
There is a degree of just complete like circumstance.

524
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But then at the same time,

525
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
as I said, circumstances are so, yeah.

526
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You might have been lucky to come across the Buddhist teaching.

527
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But luck has nothing to do with you choosing to practice or not,

528
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
with you drilling and year after year-making efforts

529
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
of like undoing the ignorant habits of your mind.

530
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
There is absolutely no room for luck there.

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And that's why, yeah.

532
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Sometimes in the soon,

533
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
there's the monks who have developed the Sahgit Pavels to see beyond.

534
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
They would say, oh, yeah.

535
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I met that person,

536
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
because in the previous life,

537
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
we were close,

538
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and then we were bound to kind of revolve around each other,

539
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
no matter where we're reborn and so on.

540
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But all that is irrelevant.

541
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
How it came to be,

542
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
it's irrelevant.

543
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Why? Because you're responsible for what you do and account of it.

544
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You're responsible for what you choose.

545
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And the thing is, see, many people,

546
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
even back in the Buddha,

547
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
they came across the Buddha,

548
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
but not all of them seen His wisdom

549
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and not like not even half of them choose to follow it.

550
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So people can come across the purists of the Dharma instructions

551
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and not even recognizing as such.

552
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Why? Because they don't have that proper attention.

553
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So the two factors for the right view,

554
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
proper attention,

555
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and afterance of another.

556
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And proper attention, basically,

557
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
it's not a momentary,

558
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I can't even write with my second note.

559
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Proper attention is an attitude

560
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
of looking at things rightly,

561
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
not obscuring the things.

562
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So a responsible authentic attitude

563
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
will be an attitude of proper attention.

564
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Obviously, if nothing is instructed to you,

565
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
to properly attend,

566
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
that proper attention in itself

567
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
can only do out of the suffering.

568
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But with the right attitude, the proper attitude,

569
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the attitude of proper attention,

570
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and the right instruction,

571
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
you will know what to look for,

572
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
you will know what to keep attending.

573
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because as we spoke before,

574
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
the environment can't happen by luck

575
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
because attending to something rightly

576
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
has to be done way more than once,

577
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
has to be done countless numbers of times

578
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
until the handle of ignorance,

579
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
of the acts of ignorance,

580
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
wears, thin, thinner, thinner, thinner.

581
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But if you pick up the acts once,

582
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
the wouldn't handle,

583
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
there's absolutely no difference.

584
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And if you don't know,

585
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
that you're supposed to keep doing it on and on,

586
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and on, and on, and on, and on,

587
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
for seven days,

588
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
seven months, seven years,

589
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
who knows?

590
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Seven lifetimes.

591
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
If you don't know that,

592
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
there is nothing to indicate to you

593
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that you should pick that acts again.

594
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Because you can pick it once,

595
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
twice, five times,

596
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
by accident,

597
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
by chance, by your own reasoning.

598
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But there won't be any apparent proof

599
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
or a verification

600
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
that this is the way out of suffering,

601
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
not anytime soon.

602
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So unless somebody tells you

603
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
that there is a way out,

604
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and you keep sticking to it,

605
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
you won't do it.

606
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You just, like throwing a coin.

607
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You can throw a coin,

608
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and you can get,

609
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
head, five times, ten times,

610
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
but it's simply impossible,

611
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
that thousand times,

612
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
thousand throws,

613
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
will always yield the same result,

614
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
impossible.

615
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And that's exactly it.

616
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
During these thousand times,

617
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
without knowing that you're supposed to,

618
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
it's not about head and tail,

619
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
it's about actually throwing the coin,

620
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
that's what I'm doing.

621
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And let somebody tells you that,

622
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
you won't know,

623
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
because you won't be apparent.

624
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's why the, like you know,

625
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
someone, somebody who did,

626
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and liked himself,

627
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
with his own efforts,

628
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
without any external advice,

629
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
is like the greatest.

630
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And should that simple trial and error,

631
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
that took him like lifetimes to develop?

632
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So unless somebody tells you what you're doing now,

633
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
keep doing it,

634
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
maybe find you on it,

635
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
or point out more,

636
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
or whatever,

637
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
inspiring similar ways to develop the same principle,

638
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
unless you read it somewhere,

639
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
unless you're faith in what you read,

640
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
it's simply impossible,

641
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
that you repeated exactly the same way,

642
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
for thousands of times,

643
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
because there is no result to it.

644
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
No, no, no result to it.

645
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You can't see the example where you're clean.

646
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You just can't see it.

647
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Good as a thing.

648
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
There might be someone who might point out,

649
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
what can I have that will keep,

650
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that will help me make the right,

651
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
the right choice,

652
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
all the time.

653
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What can I have?

654
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What is necessary for making the right choice all the time?

655
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah.

656
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's basically impossible.

657
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You can know that you make the right choice,

658
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
only after you have repeated it,

659
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
like only after you discovered your handle,

660
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
one thing, you'll know,

661
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I worry thin.

662
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And that's exactly it.

663
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
People think it's like throwing the coin,

664
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and then you throw it,

665
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and you go to the right,

666
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
no.

667
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It doesn't matter where it's head or tail.

668
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What matters is thousands,

669
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and thousands,

670
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and thousands of times of flicking,

671
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and flicking it,

672
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and flicking it.

673
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And just see it, see it, see it.

674
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And then you realize,

675
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
it wasn't about the head or tail,

676
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
it was about wearing the dang coin down.

677
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And wearing what the coin is irrelevant

678
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
to the result that you get when you throw the coin,

679
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
it's your expectation that leads you to results.

680
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But the actual efforts,

681
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
of throwing it regardless of result,

682
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
is what worry down.

683
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So, I'm going to,

684
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
on another level,

685
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
another level of difference.

686
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Well, just on a similar level,

687
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
the photo will just one more thing,

688
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
and unless you know what you're supposed to do,

689
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
throw an afternoon off another,

690
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
be reading with suit as a study,

691
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
or whatever else,

692
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
whatever way you might have arrived at it,

693
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
it's impossible that you would have been repeating

694
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the same efforts

695
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
in the same way for a long time.

696
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's just impossible.

697
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Because there is no guidance

698
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
on what those efforts are.

699
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So, if you're using your own judgment,

700
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and the old judgment is influenced

701
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
by the inevitable expectation of pleasure

702
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
in your form of peace or whatever,

703
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
but basically you would be acting on your pleasure,

704
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
which means there will be some cravings,

705
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
which means unless somebody does externally,

706
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and then you have faith

707
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
into that more than what your own,

708
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
like initial inclinations,

709
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
you won't undo that.

710
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Because then you need to keep repeating that,

711
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
which is contrary to your own existence,

712
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
going against the grain.

713
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So, if somebody defines the grain,

714
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
so you can go against,

715
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
you won't be able to go,

716
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
because everything you do is with your grain.

717
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So, you need that external input

718
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
in which your have faith

719
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to keep sticking to it.

720
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But without that,

721
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
without that external instruction,

722
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
it's impossible that you would be repeating the same effort,

723
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
the same quality of effort,

724
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
sufficient amount of time.

725
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So, a person can attend to the right view,

726
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
accidentally,

727
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and then they can do it again,

728
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
but if they never heard about the right view,

729
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
if they never heard what the right view is,

730
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
if they never heard what the right view is,

731
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
how to the right view,

732
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
they never heard what to look for in the right view,

733
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
they never recognized what they just done was the right view,

734
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
which means it's unthinkable

735
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
that they repeat the same experience,

736
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
thousands and thousands and thousands of times,

737
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
it's simply unthinkable.

738
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Why? Because they don't recognize

739
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
that experience for what it is,

740
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
they don't want to know what to look for or not and not.

741
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So, they might accidentally,

742
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
that's what it's impossible to become

743
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
even a sort of owner by sheer accident,

744
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
or I heard it once.

745
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
When people hear something once,

746
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
like in the suitors,

747
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
they have the study once,

748
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
because their minds were already developed

749
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
through these right habits beforehand.

750
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So, the same repetition has been already developed,

751
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
and now they go like the last kind of drift

752
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
that sort of covered it all right there.

753
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
But except that,

754
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
you can't, you know,

755
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
come down, you know,

756
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
come down to the efforts.

757
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So, if someone is riddled with lust,

758
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
at one point, at one time,

759
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
riddled with anger,

760
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
there was no how-can-ite,

761
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
simply not choose that direction,

762
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
to go in that direction.

763
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
If I see that, I don't,

764
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
there's a choice.

765
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I can either continue with this lustful mode,

766
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
or not,

767
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
what starts me funny.

768
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
What makes me choose not to follow that lustful direction?

769
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Well,

770
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and what makes me choose to go further,

771
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
that's what it is.

772
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
See, if it comes to the point of being riddled

773
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
by anger,

774
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
by lust or by anger,

775
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
well, what you need to recognize

776
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
is that you kind of let yourself get into that state.

777
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And once you're in that state,

778
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
there is nothing else that you can do,

779
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
except endure.

780
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And that is a form of choosing no.

781
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So that's why, you know,

782
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the strength of mind to just withstand

783
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
no is necessary.

784
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But that does not necessarily bring the,

785
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
it's necessary when things kind of

786
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
come up of such nature

787
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
that you just have to endure then.

788
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But basically,

789
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
that's only like one way of dealing with it

790
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
at a time,

791
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
because fundamentally you want to find a state

792
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
where those things don't bother you at all,

793
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and there is no form of indulence.

794
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And that comes with wisdom.

795
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And that wisdom comes with foreseeing these things.

796
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So you ended up in a state of rack,

797
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
racked by anger or by lust,

798
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
because, you know,

799
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
for days and weeks before,

800
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
you didn't pay any attention to it.

801
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Or you paid attention to it wrongly.

802
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Or you were attending,

803
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
or you were attending certain central notions,

804
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
or certain irritable notions,

805
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
then, you know,

806
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
paid a few circumstances

807
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
with something that happened

808
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
with a bad mood,

809
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
with this,

810
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
with a lack of sleep,

811
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
now results in this full on anger.

812
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh,

813
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
but what do I do right here right now?

814
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Well, what you do right here,

815
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and I recognize,

816
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
right here right now,

817
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
was influenced by, you know,

818
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
quite some time before,

819
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
or if you're careless attending,

820
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
so then you become even more concerned

821
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
about attending things wrongly later on.

822
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So you actually learn from it,

823
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but at the time in itself,

824
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
just clench your teeth,

825
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
press the tongue against the ruffa and endure it.

826
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
As the Buddha said,

827
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
sometimes just you need to,

828
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
like a stronger man,

829
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
paint down the weak man,

830
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
who kind of went mad.

831
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But you have a reflexive contemplation.

832
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Of course, of course.

833
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This is my response.

834
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Sometimes, well,

835
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
you just have to endure it.

836
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Once you endure it,

837
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
once you haven't given in,

838
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
you recognize,

839
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
yeah, this is how it came about.

840
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It was through my case as attending,

841
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
so,

842
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
so then you become more concerned

843
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
about attending things carefully,

844
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
which means,

845
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
such extreme examples

846
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
where you just have to purely endure,

847
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
will be a rising less and less.

848
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Why?

849
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Because you're not, you're going away from it.

850
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
In the beginning, every thought

851
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
of centrality or anger

852
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
is the wrecking,

853
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
centrality or wrecking anger.

854
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Because the mind is just left the right,

855
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
everywhere,

856
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
and nowhere.

857
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Once you start developing that mind,

858
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
once you start recognizing

859
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
this influence of the, you know,

860
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
the mountain streams

861
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
in filling down the oceans,

862
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
then you start,

863
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
you'd stop all the time

864
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
to enter the oceans,

865
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
you just go and deal with the mountain streams,

866
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
because you know

867
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
eventually these oceans will dry up.

868
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So, in the same sense,

869
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
but carefully attending to things,

870
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
beforehand,

871
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
such extreme experiences

872
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
won't be waiting for you down the line.

873
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But,

874
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
before you've done that.

875
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Before you've done that,

876
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
you do need to endure

877
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
a fair bit of it.

878
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah.

879
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But then you...

880
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Depending how quickly you do it,

881
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
how quickly you extract this from it.

882
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Do you have that contemplation?

883
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yes, reflective.

884
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But inevitably,

885
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
to some extent,

886
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
it will come down to endurance,

887
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
endurance every now and then.

888
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And there is a very

889
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
aspect of practice in endurance,

890
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
because that's the thing.

891
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Endurance?

892
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
No matter what circumstances

893
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
have brought the options

894
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
for your choice in front of you,

895
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
it will be you choosing to...

896
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Well, you're intentionally

897
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
intending some aspects of it,

898
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
even at the time.

899
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So, obviously,

900
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
it can be very painful

901
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
to attend to the opposite.

902
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I need to say no.

903
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But it's only painful

904
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
because your mind has been going

905
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
in the direction of sensuality

906
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
for such a long time.

907
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You haven't been extracted

908
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
from it.

909
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You haven't been attending properly.

910
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So, now, when you have to say no,

911
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it's just so hard,

912
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
because the whole other one,

913
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
she's already going in.

914
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's so painful to stop it.

915
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yet, you can always do it.

916
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And that's...

917
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That makes endurance easier.

918
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You can always say no.

919
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Literally.

920
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Literally, if you have wisdom.

921
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like you can...

922
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
If you have strength,

923
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
and wisdom in regard to...

924
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Like you can have wisdom.

925
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You can know where you're supposed to choose.

926
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But if your mind is not developed,

927
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
you will be swept

928
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
by the benevolence of kind of

929
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
predetermined directions

930
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
that you've been cultivating

931
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
for so long.

932
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
This is the wrong thing.

933
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
This is the wrong thing, too.

934
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But I can't help it,

935
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
because I'm too weak.

936
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But even then,

937
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
you can say no to your weakness.

938
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So, you can always be a step ahead.

939
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And that's how reflection works.

940
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That's how intention works.

941
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Or step above.

942
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So, you can ever

943
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
family and 15 kids

944
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and absolutely nothing stops you.

945
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The next moment,

946
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you just walk out

947
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and never come back.

948
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Or from your job,

949
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
or from any other form of responsibility,

950
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
that you, yourself,

951
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
have accumulated.

952
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And that is the accumulation.

953
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Your ocean is an accumulation

954
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
of the water from the top.

955
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And then you complain,

956
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
but you're the one

957
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
who left the tap open

958
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and at the very top.

959
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So, nothing stops you.

960
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
At any given time,

961
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
you're just going to close it.

962
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And then,

963
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
just walk out.

964
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But,

965
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
what stops you is the weakness.

966
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So, that's why,

967
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
sometimes,

968
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
people can do it

969
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
over a period of time

970
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
where they have built up

971
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
the determination to leave

972
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
or the determination

973
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
to send note,

974
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
whatever.

975
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Or sometimes,

976
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
something extremely

977
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
to happen.

978
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Like, in the cities,

979
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
when people met

980
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
with extreme misfortunes,

981
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and think about misfortunes,

982
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and that's not the matter

983
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
where they may not go the other way.

984
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
All of the monks

985
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
who haven't been quite fully developed

986
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
in terms of Arachie,

987
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
but they were there

988
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
with the right view and everything.

989
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And then,

990
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
they often die

991
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
when they were about to be

992
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
set on fire

993
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
by the highway

994
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
or whatever else.

995
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Then, they kind of abandoned it all internally.

996
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
When, when,

997
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
think got real.

998
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yes, the person,

999
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
they're responsible for investing

1000
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
in external things

1001
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
like a family,

1002
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
investing in the sense,

1003
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
believing at that.

1004
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But, nothing stops you.

1005
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
They just walk out.

1006
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That's going to give me happiness.

1007
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Nothing stops you.

1008
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But, nothing stops you

1009
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
to the next moment

1010
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
to refuse to breathe.

1011
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's just obviously,

1012
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
it's unpleasant

1013
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
to not breathe.

1014
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So, you never even consider it.

1015
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But, breathing is another choice.

1016
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Neutral choice.

1017
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But, something you keep doing.

1018
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's an action.

1019
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So, nothing stops you

1020
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
to refuse to take an extinguisher.

1021
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Nothing.

1022
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And obviously,

1023
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
there's no point in not

1024
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
taking an extinguisher.

1025
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But, I'm just illustrated there.

1026
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
The point I'm making.

1027
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So, you can say no

1028
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
in any given time,

1029
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
twenty-thing.

1030
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And that's the nature of

1031
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
the aggregate of choice,

1032
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
the aggregate of intention.

1033
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You also?

1034
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
He has its own domain.

1035
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
In separable form,

1036
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
inconceivable form,

1037
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
other aggregates,

1038
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
but in itself,

1039
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
it's an independent thing.

1040
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Does intention suffer?

1041
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
No, intention is intended.

1042
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Intentions suffer.

1043
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Feelings will be,

1044
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
or feelings will be,

1045
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
the feeling suffer.

1046
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Every feeling is suffering.

1047
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Until you're another.

1048
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Where by feeling nothing,

1049
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
feelings are suffering.

1050
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Every feeling,

1051
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
the fact that you feel good about

1052
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
pleasure or pain

1053
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
or neutral,

1054
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
dead suffering,

1055
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
the fact that you're susceptible

1056
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
to a feeling.

1057
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So, feelings feel intentions intent,

1058
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
perception perceive.

1059
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
However, you can't possibly

1060
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
take these three

1061
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and examine them

1062
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
without the other two.

1063
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
They're always together.

1064
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So, you can't,

1065
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
okay, show.

1066
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So, there is a degree of

1067
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
independence

1068
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
as a domain in perception

1069
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
and feeling and intention.

1070
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But they're inseparably

1071
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
inconceivable without,

1072
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
so you can't just think

1073
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
about feeling

1074
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
without involving perception

1075
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and intention.

1076
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But you can discern them.

1077
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
As they arise,

1078
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
simultaneously,

1079
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
as this kind of group,

1080
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
well, the three are,

1081
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
you can,

1082
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
you can still, within that,

1083
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
discern and,

1084
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
discern disseparably makes.

1085
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And thus, intentions intent.

1086
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Feelings feel.

1087
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Why does intention intent this

1088
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
or intention intent that?

1089
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Well, once you stop acting

1090
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
out of your feelings,

1091
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
once you fully understood

1092
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the feelings,

1093
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
you wouldn't be

1094
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
intending based on how you feel

1095
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
because there was inconceivable

1096
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
to begin with.

1097
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Intentions cannot make

1098
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
with feelings.

1099
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's a different domain,

1100
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
different aggregate.

1101
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The completely oblivious

1102
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
to each other.

1103
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Intentions are intentions.

1104
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
They intend.

1105
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Feelings are feeling they feel.

1106
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Intentions don't feel

1107
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
or feelings do intend.

1108
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But it's your ignorance

1109
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
of region in regards to

1110
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
the kind of maker homeless,

1111
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
whereby you end up intending

1112
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
based on how you felt,

1113
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
which was inconceivable to do,

1114
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
but until you knew that it was

1115
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
inconceivable,

1116
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
you were doing it for that very reason.

1117
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So then the question,

1118
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
why did I intend this?

1119
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So that becomes,

1120
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
well, inconceivable as well.

1121
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Why does intention intent?

1122
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Because it's an intention

1123
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
that intends.

1124
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That's what it works.

1125
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And even the question,

1126
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
did you ask,

1127
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
why does this intent?

1128
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
There was always an intention

1129
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
that intended.

1130
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
They then tried to find

1131
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
a reason for intention

1132
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
elsewhere.

1133
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
In the feeling of whatever else,

1134
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
the projected notion of the world.

1135
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But I can use,

1136
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
like that,

1137
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
the idea of,

1138
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
well, I can use that

1139
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
design for pleasure

1140
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
to dig me out.

1141
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I think.

1142
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You can use the design

1143
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
for pleasant, pleasant.

1144
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Yeah.

1145
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
One thing to be free

1146
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
from suffering is wanting

1147
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
to experience peace,

1148
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
which is from pleasure.

1149
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I mean.

1150
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But you have to discern

1151
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and what pleasure.

1152
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And the word did, you know,

1153
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
when you realize,

1154
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
okay, hold on.

1155
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Not all the pleasure is bad.

1156
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Some of the pleasure is just pleasure.

1157
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It does not necessarily

1158
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
imply anything unhulsing,

1159
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
such as under-intensive.

1160
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So bending all that pleasure,

1161
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
the one that's unhulsing,

1162
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and then it's fine.

1163
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You won't have an issue.

1164
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Because then the pleasure

1165
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
to the rises is that pleasure

1166
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
it's not unhulsing.

1167
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So the design for pleasure

1168
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
can be used to basically

1169
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
develop wisdom to recognize that,

1170
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
sure, I could go after immediate pleasure

1171
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
or relatively immediate pleasure.

1172
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
But that won't bring any kind of,

1173
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
well, they won't bring any freedom

1174
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
from desire for pleasure.

1175
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It will just maintain

1176
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
the same desire for pleasure,

1177
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
which means that we're just revolving

1178
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
on the circle.

1179
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And no matter how I'm doing the pleasure I get,

1180
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
the desire for pleasure remains intact,

1181
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
which means I need more pleasure.

1182
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I need other pleasure.

1183
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I need different pleasure.

1184
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I need same pleasure.

1185
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Repetitive.

1186
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Your mind is defeated.

1187
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Mind will need pleasure.

1188
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So what if,

1189
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and that section I'm present,

1190
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
being in fact

1191
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
by constant pursuit of pleasure?

1192
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I need to develop virtue.

1193
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I need to.

1194
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Sometimes I can't say no to it.

1195
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Or sometimes what I desire for my pleasure

1196
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I simply can't get.

1197
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Thus I'll experience pain

1198
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
in every step.

1199
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So what if I abandon the whole thing?

1200
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So that nothing can cause me pleasure of pain,

1201
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
thus I won't be disturbed.

1202
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And then itself,

1203
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
that notion is very pleasant.

1204
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So then you forsake the immediate pleasure

1205
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
for the sake of that greater future pleasure

1206
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
of peace,

1207
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
of non-disturbance,

1208
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
of the disturbance of, you know,

1209
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
the abandoning of suffering.

1210
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Then you can also think about

1211
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
yes, but looking into the future

1212
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
is saying if I choose this now,

1213
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
not going after the last four objects,

1214
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
not indulging in the past,

1215
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
then in the future,

1216
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I'll be free from all sorts of failures.

1217
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Well, yeah.

1218
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
As simple as that,

1219
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
reflecting right here right now,

1220
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
that if you choose to say no to the choice of last,

1221
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
means by not engaging the last,

1222
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
further down the line in the future,

1223
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
you'll be able to see through the nature of that last.

1224
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And then be free from it once and for all.

1225
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So that's why the restraint

1226
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
needs to come first.

1227
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
See that comes before the dharma.

1228
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
To get some photos of it.

1229
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Well, exactly.

1230
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Because if you don't say no to it,

1231
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
then once you're in it,

1232
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
you can't be conceiving,

1233
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
okay, now once I'm fully within the domain last,

1234
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I can practice a separation from last,

1235
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
being free from last.

1236
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
No, because you just place yourself in it.

1237
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Basically, again, the similarly from the sutras,

1238
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
trying to light the fire with the two sticks,

1239
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
you need to dry them up.

1240
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So if you had the two semi-dry sticks,

1241
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
and you choose to stay on the ground,

1242
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and say no to the water,

1243
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
say no to the lust,

1244
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
then we'll dry out.

1245
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And you can know that,

1246
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
so all you need to do is resist the urge to go into water.

1247
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That is very impressing at the time.

1248
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
But if you say no,

1249
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
you know that I mentioned these sticks will dry,

1250
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and when they do dry,

1251
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
you can light the fire of knowledge,

1252
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
and so on.

1253
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Even in the other hand,

1254
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
you have the semi-dry sticks,

1255
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and you choose to go back in the water,

1256
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
no matter how much you wish for them to be dry,

1257
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
you are in the water,

1258
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
they will not be dry.

1259
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So you can't have any reasonable expectation

1260
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
to light up the fire of knowledge

1261
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and see through the nature of lust,

1262
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
because you just set yourself back in the water.

1263
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
You have to have it reasoned.

1264
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yeah, reasoned.

1265
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
For seeing it, expecting it,

1266
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
knowing where it's going to lead,

1267
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and choosing the opposite.

1268
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And that's why,

1269
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
non-lust is,

1270
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
you can never go wrong with it,

1271
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
by saying no to lust,

1272
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
or greed,

1273
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
no to aversion,

1274
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
or delusion.

1275
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It can never result,

1276
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
in unwholesome.

1277
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
A renunciation can never result,

1278
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
in unwholesome.

1279
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Which is why,

1280
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
it is wholesome.

1281
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It can never participate in anything unwholesome.

1282
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So if you're ever in doubt,

1283
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
oh, should I say yes?

1284
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So no, just see which one has lust in it.

1285
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Which choice would have lust?

1286
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
If saying no implies lust,

1287
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
then do the opposite.

1288
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah.

1289
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Like, oh,

1290
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
if I stay here,

1291
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
where, you know,

1292
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I'll be subjected to lustful impressions

1293
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
or to anger impressions.

1294
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So,

1295
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
if I stay here,

1296
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I leave myself acceptable to this thing so I'll go.

1297
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So I won't say yes to stay here.

1298
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I'll say no.

1299
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Oh,

1300
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
if somebody says,

1301
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
do what I,

1302
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
do what I,

1303
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
do what I want to go elsewhere,

1304
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and you know that that place is more risky

1305
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
in terms of

1306
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
inducing lust,

1307
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
or aversion,

1308
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
or whatever,

1309
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
then you say no to that.

1310
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So you always say no to lust,

1311
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
aversion, delusion.

1312
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But in volatile,

1313
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
that might sometimes mean saying yes to certain things.

1314
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yes.

1315
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yes.

1316
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I want to leave this place.

1317
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
No.

1318
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I don't want to stay here.

1319
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Or no.

1320
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I want to go there.

1321
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yes.

1322
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I want to stay here.

1323
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And that choice,

1324
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
if there is wisdom,

1325
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
will be determined like which one is,

1326
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
which one implies non-lust,

1327
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
or which one implies cessation of lust,

1328
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
cessation of aversion,

1329
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
cessation of aversion.

1330
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Sometimes it's not that clear.

1331
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But then you see,

1332
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
well, which one is more likely

1333
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
to be implying non-lust,

1334
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
non-aversion,

1335
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
non-delusion.

1336
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So that's what you choose.

1337
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Even though, oh, okay,

1338
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
oops,

1339
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I went to this place and now it's,

1340
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
it's filled with...

1341
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Oops, yeah.

1342
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But then within that,

1343
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
you can choose the non-lust,

1344
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
non-aversion,

1345
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
that doesn't mean giving inferno.

1346
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Because you intended, firstly,

1347
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
to go against the lust,

1348
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
so that's the main.

1349
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yes.

1350
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah.

1351
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Whatever the external results come,

1352
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
that's not...

1353
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Exactly.

1354
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Because your choice was governed by the,

1355
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
by the kind of, well,

1356
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
the criteria of renunciation

1357
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
in terms of create aversion delusion.

1358
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And that is the whole thing.

1359
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So, yeah,

1360
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I have not been in the middle of the village,

1361
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
but I came there

1362
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
through avoiding the other lust,

1363
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
and now here I can keep doing the same.

1364
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Because it's always a matter of choice.

1365
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You know, last,

1366
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
the version delusion can never,

1367
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
like, be thrown on you

1368
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
without your choice or say.

1369
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You might not be able to say no to it,

1370
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
if you're not developing regard to it,

1371
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
but it always remains...

1372
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But it's down to...

1373
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It's down to you,

1374
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
like it's the first end of kind of,

1375
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
that's the standard that you start,

1376
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
all the base.

1377
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
No...

1378
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I can't reach you in the middle of the illusion.

1379
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah.

1380
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I do my best to...

1381
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
to do that.

1382
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And then you can tell you that further,

1383
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
even to your own thinking,

1384
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
but you might not be doing anything

1385
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and also in terms of the body of the speech,

1386
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
but your mind on this earlier

1387
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
was things good stuff.

1388
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Then you take it there,

1389
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
and then address that.

1390
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's always sometimes the other way

1391
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
or how I want to go for a retreat.

1392
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
You can give me a brief instruction,

1393
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
and say, you know,

1394
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I can ponder on it.

1395
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Okay, whatever you know,

1396
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
it's an awesome abandoning,

1397
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
whatever you know,

1398
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
it's awesome cultivating.

1399
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That's it.

1400
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Three months later,

1401
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Ireland emerges from the retreat,

1402
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
because that's all they're kind of

1403
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
doing, and it's enough to communicate.

1404
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I like that, because it's...

1405
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
it's set up...

1406
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
a person that...

1407
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
what is an awesome...

1408
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
what is...

1409
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah.

1410
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Awesome.

1411
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Because then it sets up

1412
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
that whole contemplation,

1413
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
having to watch the choice,

1414
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
having to...

1415
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Everything you build on double-end and double-end.

1416
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yes.

1417
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
What's it?

1418
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Am I?

1419
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, is this a good choice?

1420
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Is this whole interest or not?

1421
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Well, have a look.

1422
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Is it based...

1423
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
is it founded in your desire?

1424
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Yeah.

1425
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
In what desire is it founded?

1426
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Like, I'm only going to live on top of the mountain,

1427
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
where it's quiet, undisturbed,

1428
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
solitude, so I can practice.

1429
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
That's a good desire.

1430
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
That's a desire that I can tell.

1431
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It has a good...

1432
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
good chance of resulting in fear from something.

1433
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's a mother person.

1434
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I want to...

1435
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
externally, it can look the same.

1436
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I want to go and live on top of the mountain,

1437
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
free from people, free from disturbance.

1438
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Why?

1439
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Because I...

1440
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
hate them.

1441
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I can't live with them.

1442
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I can't stand them.

1443
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I can't...

1444
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Listen to what people...

1445
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
They are a source of my anger.

1446
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah.

1447
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Yeah, whatever.

1448
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So, out of that anger, I want to run,

1449
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
they will be protected from the disturbances.

1450
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But, not necessarily, I want to run,

1451
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
they're okay.

1452
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I can't deal with this anger.

1453
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So, I want to run from the anger,

1454
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
where I will address that anger,

1455
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
so that I can never ever be angry in the future.

1456
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
If you see it...

1457
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
No.

1458
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Basically, this is what bothers me.

1459
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'll just shout it.

1460
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And how you shout it?

1461
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I'll shout it by going to the different monastery.

1462
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
When the monastery starts bothering me,

1463
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I go to another monastery.

1464
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And I go, they don't live on top of the hill,

1465
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
when nobody will disturb me.

1466
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But I myself won't be doing anything about the possibility

1467
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
to be disturbed in the first place.

1468
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Because that's a problem.

1469
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
The problem is not that you've been disturbed

1470
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
through anger or lust.

1471
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
The problem is that you lie about it.

1472
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So, even if anger or lust never ever arise in the future,

1473
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
if it remains as a possibility,

1474
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
it means you're still within the domain of anger and lust.

1475
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Which means there's no question,

1476
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
no idea, like, notion of freedom there.

1477
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Not a real one at least.

1478
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So, that's what you recognize.

1479
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
It's not about me suffering right now.

1480
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's about possibility to suffer in the future.

1481
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And that's suffering in itself.

1482
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
That concern is unpleasant.

1483
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And if you undo that,

1484
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
then you can't suffer in the present, by anything.

1485
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So, if you cease to be liable to aversion,

1486
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
liable to lust, liable to delusion,

1487
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
even if you're in the middle of the village,

1488
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
nobody can make you angry.

1489
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Nobody can make you lustful.

1490
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So, yes, I'll bend you knee to extract yourself.

1491
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Ah, from it.

1492
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But you have to be clear as to why are you doing so.

1493
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Whether your desire is rooted in genuine desire

1494
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
to be free from suffering down the line,

1495
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
or if it's rooted in simple desire to run away.

1496
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh, this bothers me.

1497
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'll go and things are more pleasant and peaceful.

1498
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
But then, you know,

1499
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
you won't be in control of the new situation,

1500
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
fundamentally, so when that changes,

1501
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
that's when you have people who look like,

1502
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I don't know, I've helped me live for whatever

1503
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
for 20-30 years,

1504
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
and if they ever end up back in the community

1505
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
or in a hospital,

1506
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
they're just losing.

1507
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Nothing.

1508
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
No involvement.

1509
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Nothing.

1510
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And then you have the other people

1511
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
who might have seen a degree of this,

1512
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
but then they develop a viewer account of it,

1513
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
which overrides the current experience,

1514
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
now that's why I've used the dangerous,

1515
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
because you can like contradict exactly

1516
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
what you're experiencing.

1517
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So they might have been developing a view

1518
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
that, no, you should never leave the group of people,

1519
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
because there will be only running away.

1520
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Not necessarily.

1521
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It can be running away if that's what you act out of.

1522
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But if you act out of,

1523
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm going to run away from this right now,

1524
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
so that I can deal with it fully,

1525
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
so that then I wouldn't care whether I'm alone or without this.

1526
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
No, that's a good running away.

1527
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But people who kind of might have seen the danger running away

1528
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
or met a few people who ran away,

1529
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
then they came back and lost it.

1530
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Then without trying themself,

1531
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
without distinguishing the nature of the motive in itself,

1532
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
then they're working the view that no.

1533
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Leaving the group, leaving the setting is bad.

1534
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
No, no.

1535
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
You make it good or bad depending on the reasons for your action.

1536
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Depending whether it was rooted in wholesome or unwholesome.

1537
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And the view is unwholesome.

1538
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Why? Because you just override any good and bad by saying it's bad.

1539
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Because it can be good or can be bad depending on why you do it.

1540
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Like leaving the group, going to live alone or similar.

1541
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You can't.

1542
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
But you can put a blanket rule over it.

1543
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
You just cover it with a bed and that's bad.

1544
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Now you cover it all up and now you can't see the nature.

1545
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Which means there won't be any discernment of wholesome.

1546
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I'm rooted in wholesome, rooted in our wholesome.

1547
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
You decided before that.

1548
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah, I mean both of those things are the externals.

1549
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It's because of the external things.

1550
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah.

1551
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
That's one sufferer.

1552
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Yeah.

1553
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
So therefore I will stay in a community because...

1554
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
To keep the external things in the same way so I want something.

1555
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Because being in it, there's many people that helps.

1556
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And it's not incidental that always those views that are kind of pasted over the actual particular things that you might be experiencing.

1557
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Those views are always fueled by the unwholesome.

1558
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Well, not taking responsibility.

1559
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah, that's it.

1560
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So basically I will condemn everybody that leaves the group.

1561
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Why?

1562
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Because deep down inside, they're terrified to do it myself.

1563
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Or I will condemn the group.

1564
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Why?

1565
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Because deep down inside, I'm incapable of living without a people.

1566
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I just find it intolerable.

1567
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So basically people end up adopting the views based on the underlying kind of notions that are unwholesome.

1568
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Either fear, or hate, or lust, or whatever.

1569
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Oh, or like, oh, I've long been going to the level of the Mahadevastani.

1570
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Because the community is good.

1571
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's good to help people.

1572
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's good.

1573
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And deep down inside, I'm simply afraid to go without food.

1574
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Sometimes it can be as simple as that.

1575
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I'm afraid that my food will be too rough on the mountain.

1576
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,000
So I'll find every single justification to stay in the monastery.

1577
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Including meeting people, distractions, engagements, duties, sense of importance, sense of accomplishment, sense of career, sense of whatever else.

1578
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And again, I met quite a fair deal of other people who know being a monk is about living alone in the forest and doing this.

1579
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Why?

1580
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Because they have such serious issues that they can't stand.

1581
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Anyone, no matter how kind, good they are to them.

1582
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
They just pure hatred towards another.

1583
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So the only way for me to remain in this kind of setting that I sort of ended up in

1584
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:08,000
is to run away from everybody and hide in the forest and just keep it to a bare minimum meeting with others because I just can't stand it.

1585
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And I don't have to do it.

1586
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But I just lose my composition every single time.

1587
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yet externally, you can paint either of those.

1588
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I'm also mean that's awesome.

1589
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
No.

1590
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
But I said you live in the forest.

1591
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Well, he said something else in conjunction with that.

1592
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
He said only those who are ready to live in the forest should live in the forest.

1593
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I said, you're going to say you should keep it in the community. He said, yes, he said only those who are kind of capable of keeping it in the community should keep it in the community.

1594
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:42,000
So he did not adopt a law that kind of overrides everything else regardless of the actual particular circumstances.

1595
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And that's why he wouldn't have made all those tangos mandatory.

1596
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And when they were not as requested, they didn't know.

1597
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
A railroad should be mandatory. He came from one board should be mandatory. He said, no, let those from one over there go where that goes.

1598
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Let those who don't want to do it don't want to do it.

1599
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And whether they want to do it or not want to do it should be determined through their understanding of awesome and awesome.

1600
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
So the person who understood awesome is an awesome will want awesome.

1601
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And being an ascetic is not necessarily awesome for everyone because people can do it from very wrong reasons.

1602
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

1603
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
But they're basically standardly, one starts them. I want to be free from suffering.

1604
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I can't do it too much, pay attention or give in to the last four green hand people to do it.

1605
01:00:49,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So you can find that exactly that thing to the extent whereby you have inspiration to go out of the monastery and live in the mountains.

1606
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And then you recognize it.

1607
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It's not necessarily coming out of unwholesome, but it's coming out of well intoxication that came with inspiration.

1608
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And you realize well, there might be a great deal of delusion involved in this because I'm not acting out of genuine recognition that this will be good for me.

1609
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I'm acting because I'm so inspired and full of energy to do it.

1610
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
So you take it cautiously.

1611
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So you go halfway up the mountain, so I have to speak and see if that's bringing awesome to increase, unwholesome to decrease, or all the way around.

1612
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
If it's all the way around, we'll go back and restart it another time.

1613
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:47,000
But also it clears up the quote when you have the question, what should I do?

1614
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Well, exactly.

1615
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I don't do those. That's what I'm intending on with people talking. So whatever I do.

1616
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So it's not bad to have sexual intercourse, not bad to have a wife, not bad to have kids.

1617
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
No, it's not. Depending on what you want to do.

1618
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Depending on what you want to do.

1619
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
People think in terms of the eternal judgement, this is bad, this is good.

1620
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It depends on what you want to do.

1621
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Yeah, killing is always bad.

1622
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Breaking five precepts is always bad.

1623
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,000
That's why it's the basic requirement that distinguishes humans from animals if they stick to it.

1624
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
So there are those in there.

1625
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
But let me ask you further on.

1626
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Well, I'm not judging people who are families and I want to leave it.

1627
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I'm just saying that if this is what you want to do, well, that contradicts it.

1628
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
So you can't have it both ways.

1629
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm generally in practitioner with a teaching and at the same time, being engaged in a sexual intercourse,

1630
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
whatever, will you not?

1631
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Because the Buddha said himself, you can't have it both.

1632
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
So that's exactly the thing.

1633
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:07,000
It's more like you recognize for yourself whether the things you want to do, your choices, your intentions,

1634
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
even the way you attend to things.

1635
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I've been rooted in lust, awareness, delusion or not.

1636
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But some of you must.

1637
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Externally, that's irrelevant.

1638
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Like there is a basis of the five precepts or eight precepts later on.

1639
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But then everything else in between can be very good and very bad externally.

1640
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
But internally, actually, you are the only one that would know.

1641
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Oh no, it's good.

1642
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's good to go.

1643
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's good to sit on a group retreat.

1644
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
That's something.

1645
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I'm necessarily.

1646
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I would say it's like a...

1647
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Yeah, I want to be...

1648
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I want to give a craving for another person.

1649
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I want to give up craving for sexual activity.

1650
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But I'm just not ready for that right now.

1651
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Maybe in the future.

1652
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
You chose to not be ready.

1653
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
You chose to...

1654
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
That to be the case.

1655
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And sometimes, you know, things...

1656
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Again, it depends on what you attend.

1657
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Like things you get very subtle.

1658
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So, it's not necessarily bad.

1659
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Or rather, it's not necessarily an awesome, but it can be an awesome.

1660
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So, say you're hungry.

1661
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So, you need the food in order to not die.

1662
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
But then, at the same time, you choose only the food that you like.

1663
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So, you're...

1664
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So, you're clearly, basically, acting out of lust for tasters.

1665
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
That kind of also implies eating the food.

1666
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
But that's why you should, like, attend carefully.

1667
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Like, we know the contemplation that we chant in the morning

1668
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
back in the monastery.

1669
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Like, the reason why you eat.

1670
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Like, okay, there's no question you abstain from sex.

1671
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
You abstain from killing. You're safe from lying.

1672
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
But you can't abstain from eating because you'll die.

1673
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So, you have to eat.

1674
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Then you can say, well, I will only...

1675
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Only things I don't like.

1676
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Well, that's not...

1677
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
That's, again, putting on an external decision.

1678
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Because if you do only what you don't like,

1679
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
then you might start liking torturing yourself.

1680
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
You might start enjoying that unhulsingly.

1681
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Hence, there won't be any wisdom arising.

1682
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
No, so you just want to make sure that while you're eating,

1683
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
you make sure that your act of eating

1684
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
doesn't get rooted in an awesome denial for the pleasant taste.

1685
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
So then you won't be running away from nice food that you like,

1686
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
that you liked, but you won't be affected by it.

1687
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That's the thing.

1688
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Because people think, oh, I really want to eat dish A

1689
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
on a kind of dish B, which I don't really like.

1690
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So I should really go with what I don't like.

1691
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
But that's just like projecting it externally.

1692
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Like putting responsibility on that which you don't like.

1693
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Saying, I will choose what I don't like.

1694
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Sure, you can do it once or twice.

1695
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
But sooner or later, you will get dependent on the view

1696
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
to always do the opposite of what you want to do.

1697
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I, you will become dependent on the view

1698
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
to torture yourself, to cause, to intentionally flick paint you.

1699
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So, sooner or later, you can't sustain it.

1700
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But what you want to do basically is recognize I have to eat.

1701
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
So whether it dish A or B doesn't matter.

1702
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I prefer dish A to dish B.

1703
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I might eat both and then remain mindful in terms of the dish B

1704
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
to not be hating and thinking about dish A while I meet in dish B.

1705
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And at the same time while I meet in dish A,

1706
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
to not be like, well, overjoyed on account of it

1707
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
or careless in regard to the experience of taste of the dish A.

1708
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So you may be mindful in regard to both tastes because you have to eat.

1709
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And above all, you remain mindful as to why you have to eat

1710
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
in order to sustain the body.

1711
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
If that thought, literally, if that thought remains established in you,

1712
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
you will not overdo the joy when it comes to the dish you like.

1713
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Nor will you be too concerned when it comes to dish you don't like.

1714
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Why? Because the point is to eat whatever.

1715
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And you remain rooted in that.

1716
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
True mindfulness means there won't be any rise given to the other person.

1717
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
You canlessly attend to what you are eating.

1718
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You forget why you are eating or rather you forget to root things

1719
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
in the right reasons for eating.

1720
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You will inevitably be taken by what?

1721
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
By the senses. You will be taken by that which is the strongest,

1722
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
which is the pull of the taste.

1723
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So that's why the same act of eating can be rooted in completely

1724
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
and you're responsible for that.

1725
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
So you don't have to.

1726
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And when you start losing yourself properly and establishing from that,

1727
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
then you wouldn't care as the Buddha said.

1728
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Like I have disciples who live only on one land full of rice every second day.

1729
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
While at that time, I would be eating like the finest curry.

1730
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And I would sometimes eat a bowl full to the brim with the food.

1731
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And then I would have another one.

1732
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So he would eat two arms bowls to the brim of the nicest food.

1733
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
While he has disciples who live on a handful of rice,

1734
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
if there was the goal of practice to live and have,

1735
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
they would not be respecting him any in any way whatsoever.

1736
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
But the goal of the practice is to not be affected by the food,

1737
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
to not be affected by the senses,

1738
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,000
to not be rooted in unwholesome based on the pull of the senses.

1739
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
That's the goal of the practice.

1740
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So whether it's a present taste, touch, sounds, maison,

1741
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
it will not pull you into unwholesome.

1742
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That's the goal of the practice.

1743
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
When you establish that, then you can eat whatever.

1744
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You establish the principle and then you're not pulled.

1745
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So then, yeah, the Buddha can have the finest silk robes

1746
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and three bowls of food in front of him if he wants.

1747
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And you'll still respect him as much as you did on the first day

1748
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
when he was just living as an ascetic.

1749
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Now when he's found frequented by the kings,

1750
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
and you'll respect him.

1751
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
In the same sense, why?

1752
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Because you know where the goal is,

1753
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and you understood what his teaching was,

1754
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and that teaching freed you from suffering.

1755
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
So you might choose to live under a little tree

1756
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
enjoying one handful of rice every three days,

1757
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
because you don't need more,

1758
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
and that's what makes you happy and content,

1759
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and not disturbed and peaceful.

1760
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Yet you'll still respect him while he lives in a palace.

1761
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Because that was never the point of the practice.

1762
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Yeah, the external.

1763
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Yeah, it's good.

1764
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Every teacher says it's very similar thing about food.

1765
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Being at a banquet tonight.

1766
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Food that comes your way.

1767
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
You just take up what you need.

1768
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
If you don't like to call and grab a piece more than you.

1769
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
You happen to come across,

1770
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
that like showers' food comes,

1771
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
happens to be in your head.

1772
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
You have it because you need to eat.

1773
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Yeah.

1774
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
If it's very low food, just like that.

1775
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And if you don't know,

1776
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
just reestablish the mindfulness into why you need to eat,

1777
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
and keep that thought while you're eating.

1778
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
For as long as that thought is present while you're eating,

1779
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
no matter to what degree it's present,

1780
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
sometimes more, sometimes less,

1781
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
feel establishing the mindfulness.

1782
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And as an anchor,

1783
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
you're beating for the right reasons,

1784
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
no matter what.

1785
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And that's, you know,

1786
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I remember I met people amongst

1787
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
who, obviously,

1788
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
a big downer,

1789
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
loads of food.

1790
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I had 50 dishes.

1791
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And then,

1792
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
instead of taking responsibility

1793
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
for the fact that you have to eat,

1794
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and then eating what, you know,

1795
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
you find agreeable,

1796
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
not necessarily always what you really, really like,

1797
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
but say, you know,

1798
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I don't like certain things,

1799
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
but I'll take them.

1800
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Because I learned that they're very nutritional,

1801
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
that they can keep me going further.

1802
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So I would have to eat less.

1803
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
You go for that even if you don't like.

1804
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Sometimes I find out that this really thing

1805
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
that I really happen to like.

1806
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I really, I love the taste of that.

1807
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
It's also very, very good for you.

1808
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I'll take that.

1809
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I will not forget why I need to eat.

1810
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
But then those monks

1811
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
would not necessarily think like,

1812
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
well, they would not descend to their level,

1813
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
so they would recognize the problem of preference.

1814
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
The kind of preference is not a problem,

1815
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
but preference in juicing last is a problem.

1816
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
But instead of recognizing that

1817
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
it's taking up responsibility for it,

1818
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
they try to deny it.

1819
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So they would either always take what they don't like.

1820
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I always take what I want less.

1821
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
That means, okay, so you're basically attributing

1822
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
choice to the view of going after

1823
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
that which is less desirable.

1824
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I am not responsible.

1825
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
There are three choices.

1826
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I'll go for the one I least want.

1827
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
But that's already something you've chosen beforehand.

1828
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
But now you're attributing it.

1829
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And then I even make some months for like,

1830
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
saying, I will take only every third dish,

1831
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
whatever that dish might be.

1832
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Which means, so now you're attributing

1833
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
responsibility to the chance.

1834
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
See, all of that is irrelevant, actually,

1835
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
if they were to remain mindful as to why they're eating.

1836
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
But clearly, the failure of putting an importance

1837
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
of how the dishes are chosen

1838
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
means they're not mindful when they were eating.

1839
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Why? Because, hey, I didn't choose out of my preference.

1840
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I've chosen out of this every third dish algorithm

1841
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
that I wrote.

1842
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Thus, I can forget about because now it's fine.

1843
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Whatever I hate my ball, it's fine.

1844
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
None of it is fine.

1845
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
That's how you should start.

1846
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
No food is fine to eat.

1847
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Good or bad?

1848
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You only have to eat because you want to survive.

1849
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And if you keep that, then you wouldn't care

1850
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
what food is in your bowl,

1851
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
whether it's tasty or not.

1852
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Because you realize none of it is fine.

1853
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
But they all come from the point of view that food is fine.

1854
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
There's a somewhere that is a bigger problem than the other.

1855
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Then you try to avoid by choosing the opposite.

1856
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Point being, none of that would actually be a problem for them.

1857
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
If they were to remain mindful

1858
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
why they're eating as to why.

1859
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Why they're eating as to why they're eating.

1860
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Hungry food, though.

1861
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
This is impossible to eat without giving in

1862
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
to the sense domain of taste,

1863
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
to the animal that pertains to that domain, to that pool.

1864
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
But what can do is keep it in check.

1865
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I let it eat because it needs to eat.

1866
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
But I'll keep it in check as to how grounded

1867
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I'll change it to the reason why I'm eating.

1868
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Which is to sustain this body no more.

1869
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
So on some days they will be food that their animal likes.

1870
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
The sense of taste finds it agreeable.

1871
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
They find it disagreeable.

1872
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
But you won't be bothered by going through all this effort

1873
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
of always finding a disagreeable taste.

1874
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Because you realize agreeable, disagreeable both are on the same domain.

1875
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
And that's not the problem.

1876
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
The problem is that that was affected by it.

1877
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And you can be equally affected by disagreeable.

1878
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Because sometimes if you don't,

1879
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
like if you always go around choosing the disagreeable taste,

1880
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
sometimes you're presented by tastes

1881
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and none of them is disagreeable.

1882
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
What are you going to choose then?

1883
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Then you won't be able to not be affected by a agreeable taste.

1884
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Because you were running away from it into disagreeable.

1885
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Which was also the level of taste.

1886
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So you don't care about a agreeable taste or disagreeable taste.

1887
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
You care about the nature of taste affecting you.

1888
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
And that can be undone or that can be accomplished.

1889
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Not being affected by that can be accomplished simply.

1890
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
But remaining mindful as to why do you need,

1891
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
why you need to give in to the taste in the first place.

1892
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Big agreeable, disagreeable, neutral.

1893
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And when you keep mind, when you develop enough mindfulness

1894
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
in regard to that, then you wouldn't care what you're eating.

1895
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
You wouldn't care what you're choosing.

1896
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
You wouldn't care how you're choosing.

1897
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
You wouldn't care if somebody else puts the food in your bowl

1898
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
or if you're going to put the food in your bowl.

1899
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
You wouldn't care if you're just going to choose the agreeable taste.

1900
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Because you're not affected by agreeable,

1901
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
none more than you're affected by disagreeable.

1902
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
You know, you'll be on both.

1903
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And then you won't be overeating.

1904
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Out of indulgence, you won't be under eating.

1905
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Under eating, you will just be eating.
