WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.200
So I thought we could just about celibacy, sexuality, since it's quite an important point

00:16.200 --> 00:23.360
for most people who are practicing most monastics anyway.

00:23.360 --> 00:34.480
And I'll be reading from the Anguitori Nikaia, the numerical discourses of the Buddha.

00:34.480 --> 00:41.040
The Buddha, he says in the beginning, the book of the One, actually.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.960
Because I do not see even one other form that sort of obsesses the mind of a man as the

00:46.960 --> 00:52.080
form of a woman, the form of a woman obsesses the mind of a man.

00:52.080 --> 01:08.040
Likewise vice versa for a woman, to the form of a woman, the smell, the whole experience

01:08.040 --> 01:15.360
of a woman obsesses one's every sense base, the form, the smell, the fact that it is,

01:15.360 --> 01:24.160
he says those who are bound by the sense of touch, are thoroughly bound.

01:24.160 --> 01:30.240
So once you can have the image of the see the woman, but once you have the touch, they

01:30.240 --> 01:33.480
had experienced that behind you thoroughly.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.480
The last drop.

01:35.480 --> 01:39.520
Yes, the last thing.

01:39.520 --> 01:46.840
And then he goes, another suitor goes on to say, because there are three things that

01:46.840 --> 01:55.480
give no sayation or are insatiable by indulging in them, what's three?

01:55.480 --> 02:04.120
By indulging in sleep, by indulging in alcohol, and by indulging in sexual intercourse.

02:04.120 --> 02:10.320
These are three things that give no sayation by indulging in them.

02:10.320 --> 02:18.880
There's no ending to the desire, to the desire and more specifically in regard to those

02:18.880 --> 02:26.960
three things.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.760
You can never have enough of it.

02:29.760 --> 02:38.640
Well, most people would feel like they already know that, and the desires are not, cannot

02:38.640 --> 02:47.280
be really satisfied and so on, but if you were, obviously if you really understand it,

02:47.280 --> 02:54.440
if you were to generally understand it, that it's insatiable, then you would actually lose

02:54.440 --> 03:01.440
an interest in it, then all this is, this is inherently structurally, countless, impossible

03:01.440 --> 03:14.040
to, the promise that it has, whatever satisfaction, getting pleasure is just, it is hollow, then

03:14.040 --> 03:23.400
it's fact, so it cannot be satisfied, which means, okay, so given in one's means, then

03:23.400 --> 03:29.720
it will be hard for you to not give in another time, and you give in another time, then

03:29.720 --> 03:34.480
it will be hard for you to not give in again, and so it will develop a habit of giving

03:34.480 --> 03:39.280
in to something that you know, it's utterly pointless.

03:39.280 --> 03:44.760
So that's what, like even somebody who doesn't necessarily want one aims at all, and she

03:44.760 --> 03:49.520
bests a goal, or on a cambio, or whatever, it will be better off like being celibate,

03:49.520 --> 03:55.280
even as a layman, it will be much better off for the mind, for the general wisdom, for

03:55.280 --> 04:01.120
general wholesomeness of life, and obviously for rebirth, because you spend your mind,

04:01.120 --> 04:08.560
you spend your human life not engaging in animal-like, carnal activities, yeah, you're

04:08.560 --> 04:14.760
going to have a better destination as a result of that, because what is it for, like getting

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
drunk?

04:15.760 --> 04:26.560
There's absolutely no fulfilment, no goal, nothing, it's basically knowing that scratching

04:26.560 --> 04:34.160
a ditch, want to remove the ditch, or you just enjoy the scratch, knowing that that scratch

04:34.160 --> 04:38.120
is actually making the ditch even worse, it's the next time, it's going to reach you

04:38.120 --> 04:50.640
even more, but you know, it's not even a temporary end to this comfort, it's just oblivion

04:50.640 --> 04:56.480
through itching, that's making things worse, and then you depend on the ditch even more,

04:56.480 --> 04:59.880
it means you depend on the living more, which means you're making things worse even

04:59.880 --> 05:11.320
more, that's like the vicious circle and the downward spiral of sensuality, but some

05:11.320 --> 05:19.520
would say that it's, it's only natural, it's actually only natural, and nature is what

05:19.520 --> 05:29.920
is natural, nature keeps you bound to river, so yeah, it is very natural, it's very natural

05:29.920 --> 05:38.600
to be reborn, it's very natural, someone said it's natural, but not necessary, sexual

05:38.600 --> 05:44.280
intercourse, there's no, yeah, of course, which is the same, but again, I don't know what

05:44.280 --> 05:50.160
context they meant, natural, some of these people, well people, when they say it's natural,

05:50.160 --> 06:00.280
nature, the design, it's kind of a whole great, a good thing, but it's not, ultimately, it

06:00.280 --> 06:06.320
is the very nature, even the nature of things, and your ignorance in regard to it, it keeps

06:06.320 --> 06:10.960
you bound, obviously you're responsible for that, you can't blame the nature of things,

06:10.960 --> 06:19.960
but nature is set up as a trap, as a deceit, so that then you give in voluntarily, almost,

06:19.960 --> 06:26.000
it's just easy, it's normal to take things at face value, it's normal to entertain ignorance

06:26.000 --> 06:31.440
as you go to it, so that's what nature is, yeah, very much so, yeah, when people say

06:31.440 --> 06:37.920
natural, then it's bad faith, it's not my fault, it's just, exactly, yeah, it's dismissing

06:37.920 --> 06:42.560
on the responsibility, oh, it's natural, that's, it's not really up to me, it's just, it's

06:42.560 --> 06:49.240
just natural to eat, they need the natural satisfaction, I guess, and there is also natural

06:49.240 --> 07:01.440
rebirth, a natural ignorance, a natural samsara, natural suffering, yeah, but there's, there's

07:01.440 --> 07:09.520
three things, sleep, drugs, alcohol, sexual intercourse, yeah, it's just, they just, they

07:09.520 --> 07:19.080
love each other, kind of thing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's all they're having,

07:19.080 --> 07:33.440
so there's another sutra we'll read, it's called, it's from the Ingoodric Nikai as well,

07:33.440 --> 07:44.520
and it's called Mother and Son, that's quite a intense sutra, yeah, yeah, yeah, another one,

07:44.520 --> 07:50.040
one occasion, the blessed one was dwelling in Sarvati and Jators Grove, now on that occasion,

07:50.040 --> 07:55.280
a mother and son, being respectively a Bikuni and a Biku, had entered the reigns residence

07:55.280 --> 08:01.600
at Sarvati, they often wanted to see one another, the mother often wanted to see her son

08:01.600 --> 08:07.760
and the son, his mother, because they often saw one another, a bond was formed, because

08:07.760 --> 08:18.440
a bond formed intimacy arose, because there was intimacy lost in the old and open, with

08:18.440 --> 08:24.200
their minds in the grip of lust, without having given up the training and declared their weakness,

08:24.200 --> 08:30.040
they engaged in sexual intercourse, then a number of Bikus approached the blessed one, paid

08:30.040 --> 08:36.280
homage to him, sat down to one side and reported what had happened, the blessed one said,

08:36.280 --> 08:41.920
Bikus, the dead foolish man think, a mother does not fall in love with her son or a son

08:41.920 --> 08:48.480
with his mother, because I do not see even one other form that is as tantalizing, sensuous

08:48.480 --> 08:54.320
and intoxicating, captivating, infatuating, and as much of an obstacle to achieving the

08:54.320 --> 09:00.720
unsurpassed security from bondage as the form of a woman, beings who are lustful for the

09:00.720 --> 09:07.880
form of a woman, ravenous, tied to it, infatuated and blindly absorbed in it, sorrow for a long

09:07.880 --> 09:14.080
time under the control of a woman's form, with the experience of a woman, because they

09:14.080 --> 09:24.760
sound, they smell, they taste, they touch, Bikus, while walking, a woman obsesses the mind

09:24.760 --> 09:30.800
of a man, while standing, while sitting, while laying down, while laughing, while speaking,

09:30.800 --> 09:37.680
while singing, while crying, a woman obsesses the mind of a man, when swollen, too, a woman

09:37.680 --> 09:45.480
obsesses the mind of a man, even when dead, a woman obsesses the mind of a man.

09:45.480 --> 09:51.560
If Bikus, one could rightly say of anything, entirely a snare of mara, it is precisely

09:51.560 --> 09:57.440
of a woman that one could say this, one might talk with a murderous foe, one might talk

09:57.440 --> 10:03.200
with an evil spirit, one might even approach a viper, whose bite means certain death, but

10:03.200 --> 10:11.080
was the woman, one to one, one should never talk, they bind one whose mind is muddled with

10:11.080 --> 10:17.480
a glance and a smile, with their dress in disarray and with their gentle speech.

10:17.480 --> 10:23.480
She is not safe to approach such a person, though she is swollen and dead.

10:23.480 --> 10:29.520
These five objects of central pleasure are seen in a woman's body, form, sounds, tastes,

10:29.520 --> 10:36.040
and odors, and also delightful touches, those swept up by the flood of sensuality, who

10:36.040 --> 10:42.200
do not fully understand sensual pleasures, are plunged headlong into some sorrow, into

10:42.200 --> 10:46.880
time, destination and existence upon existence.

10:46.880 --> 10:51.840
For those who have fully understood sensual pleasures, live without fear from any quarter,

10:51.840 --> 10:58.480
having attained the destruction of the taints, while in the world they have gone beyond.

10:58.480 --> 11:07.760
And just to be said, it works the same way, for a woman, it is the form of a man, the

11:07.760 --> 11:17.240
sex, you can just replace it, and I don't know when I have to address it, but I think some

11:17.240 --> 11:19.840
people might, when they read things like that, obviously they read it with no wisdom or

11:19.840 --> 11:26.680
not even enough transparency to see what they refer to, and then they take it personally,

11:26.680 --> 11:32.200
and think the Buddha was blaming women, or the Buddha was blaming men, it wasn't.

11:32.200 --> 11:38.760
So the nature of things is that you, with the mind affected with ignorance, will be snared

11:38.760 --> 11:42.080
by a form of a woman.

11:42.080 --> 11:47.360
Woman's mind, affected with ignorance, will be snared by a form of a man.

11:47.360 --> 11:51.800
But that doesn't actually mean that that particular woman or that particular man are responsible

11:51.800 --> 11:55.000
for that snare, they just carried this form.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.640
Now they are responsible for their own ignorance in regard to their own form, they were given

11:59.640 --> 12:04.000
to them, circumstantially.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.960
So it kind of, it's not, it's not on the level of a full on clear volition that every woman

12:10.960 --> 12:15.400
is out to get every man, or that every man is out to seduce an every woman.

12:15.400 --> 12:26.520
No, simply by taking a masculine form, by assuming it, that's basically that masculine aspect

12:26.520 --> 12:33.040
of it, which you yourself had nothing to do with, it was just given to you.

12:33.040 --> 12:40.000
So in a way, a man is a victim of his own masculinity, as much as a woman is, that is being affected

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
by it.

12:41.000 --> 12:49.120
Another woman is also a victim of her own femininity, as much as the man is snared by it.

12:49.120 --> 12:54.520
And that's another subject that the Buddha says, by giving in to the notions of your own

12:54.520 --> 12:55.520
masculinity.

12:55.520 --> 13:01.120
And make yourself liable to be, basically, to be snared by the opposite, by the female,

13:01.120 --> 13:03.840
by the feminine notions and feminine forms.

13:03.840 --> 13:09.360
And same for a woman, by entertaining, by delighting in her femininity, she maintains herself

13:09.360 --> 13:14.080
liable to a snare of a male form of the opposite.

13:14.080 --> 13:21.160
It's one's own, doing one's own delighting, exactly, yeah, yeah.

13:21.160 --> 13:27.600
The lust is found in your own mind, yeah, yeah.

13:27.600 --> 13:34.280
So that, you can say that, but in this particular suit, that female form that snares a man, it's

13:34.280 --> 13:38.800
the same female form that traps a woman.

13:38.800 --> 13:44.720
And you can say that the male form that snares a woman, the masculinity, that snares a woman,

13:44.720 --> 13:49.560
it's the same masculinity that traps a man.

13:49.560 --> 13:55.240
So that's why, again, in another suit, you should look at your own body, at your own,

13:55.240 --> 14:00.000
not delight in your masculinity as a man or a feminine, as a woman, and look at it as

14:00.000 --> 14:04.440
with a disgust that you would look on a pile of feces on the road, you would avoid it,

14:04.440 --> 14:07.040
you wouldn't step in it.

14:07.040 --> 14:13.720
So you actually, in order to not be snared by a form of a woman, a man needs to actually

14:13.720 --> 14:19.640
abandon the light and holding on to his masculinity.

14:19.640 --> 14:24.840
It doesn't mean he needs to become feminine, which means he needs to not regard the given

14:24.840 --> 14:27.600
masculinity as belonging to him.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.200
He was given to no one, he has just a reason, and he will cease when the argument is

14:31.200 --> 14:32.200
break apart.

14:32.200 --> 14:37.120
There is no need for him to take it up and interfere with it, and the same goes for a woman.

14:37.120 --> 14:42.440
Her femininity is a reason, it's a potential, it was given, whatever, determined by chance,

14:42.440 --> 14:48.400
by elements, by previous lives, whatever, it's just how it is, and she's fully responsible

14:48.400 --> 14:54.200
for taking it, and she will be fully responsible for freeing herself from it.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.400
If she doesn't take it, it doesn't mean she has a sex change and becomes a man or something

14:58.400 --> 15:03.120
like no, it just simply means whatever has a reason, you leave it as it is.

15:03.120 --> 15:11.360
So then that femininity for a woman will not entrap her, and by not being entraped into

15:11.360 --> 15:17.280
that, that is liable, basically, to be snared by the opposite, by the masculinity.

15:17.280 --> 15:24.280
She won't be, she won't be snared by neither.

15:24.280 --> 15:30.080
So you're responsible, a man is responsible for dwelling, for entertaining, for delighting,

15:30.080 --> 15:37.200
for holding onto his masculinity, because of that, he's liable to snare, that sort of

15:37.200 --> 15:43.080
comes and covers up that field of masculinity where he abides, carelessly.

15:43.080 --> 15:48.760
If he were to withdraw his mind from that notion of masculinity, he can be very masculine externally,

15:48.760 --> 15:52.000
but his mind is not taking it to be his.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.400
He doesn't need to go to like a, I don't know, a retraining of his speech or behavior

15:59.400 --> 16:04.600
and become refined and soft spoken and stuff, that's just management of external circumstances

16:04.600 --> 16:12.120
which will never a problem in itself, which means that management is completely misguided.

16:12.120 --> 16:20.600
So whatever, like, you know, if your habits are a course, whatever, if your habits are

16:20.600 --> 16:26.360
a course, or whatever, it doesn't matter, what matters is you don't actually appropriate

16:26.360 --> 16:32.520
the pictures a whole for a man that pictures him, he's a masculine, it's a man.

16:32.520 --> 16:40.160
So he can, he can, he can stay masculine, as long as that masculinity doesn't belong

16:40.160 --> 16:46.280
to him, that's all it takes, except for a woman, obviously they will limit the amount

16:46.280 --> 16:51.280
of your interaction, so to speak, the amount of actions you will do an account of that

16:51.280 --> 16:56.680
masculinity, like somebody who is entertaining that masculinity will obviously be revolving

16:56.680 --> 17:02.840
on a woman who, who, who delights in her femininity, will obviously be putting that forward,

17:02.840 --> 17:07.920
her feminine side, she'll be indulging it, taking it step further, developing it, refining

17:07.920 --> 17:10.520
it, whatever else.

17:10.520 --> 17:17.360
So that won't be done by the person who has abandoned either masculine and femininity

17:17.360 --> 17:23.520
respectively, but it doesn't mean that they have to undo whatever has a reason on its

17:23.520 --> 17:29.800
side, because you're a man, it's a fact, you're born in a male gender, you're born in female

17:29.800 --> 17:34.680
gender, that's it, you don't need to deny it, you know, because whatever, you don't know

17:34.680 --> 17:39.280
the escape from it, which is usually when people try to do it, how it's genderless, it's

17:39.280 --> 17:46.240
beyond gender, it's not, gender is given, it's a fact, it's your world, your body is your

17:46.240 --> 17:50.800
world, it determines it, determines the intentionality behind it, determines all the desire, but

17:50.800 --> 17:57.320
you don't have to take it to belong to you, and that's what Aranji is, so a woman can

17:57.320 --> 18:01.960
stay a woman, she'll stay a woman, and she can be an Aranth, obviously she won't be

18:01.960 --> 18:05.880
doing anything else in reality, or anything else in a kind of appropriation of the body,

18:05.880 --> 18:11.080
which she has completely free herself from, so her mind goes beyond it, but it doesn't

18:11.080 --> 18:16.800
mean that you deny it, she still knows the fact that this is a female body, and same

18:16.800 --> 18:37.440
for a man, because what about the, she could, when he could make the other, by entertaining

18:37.440 --> 18:43.400
his masculinity, he knows what he's doing as well, he has a track team, yes, of course,

18:43.400 --> 18:47.160
that's a female, of course, yeah, no it can be, it can be done intentionally, there's

18:47.160 --> 18:53.240
no doubt about that, it's a seduction, no matter who does it to who, but then that would

18:53.240 --> 18:58.600
be impossible if a man, like a man wouldn't be able to seduce a woman if he's not giving

18:58.600 --> 19:04.040
notions and appropriating and delighting in his masculinity, and same, a woman who is

19:04.040 --> 19:11.600
given up her femininity, wouldn't be out trying to seduce men, nor would she be out, or

19:11.600 --> 19:16.400
even delighting in the notions of being liked by men, or being disliked by men, does

19:16.400 --> 19:22.920
it even matter to her, and same, it even matters to a man, if every, like, like, like, when

19:22.920 --> 19:27.320
they were on the ruler, they had a hand, he was apparently in the suit, as he was still

19:27.320 --> 19:31.920
very handsome, so lots of women, just, you know, when they were not, when they were

19:31.920 --> 19:36.200
doing this, and when they tried to seduce him, and you know, number of our rules evolved

19:36.200 --> 19:42.080
around that, like, not to belong because the stories that had happened to him, I mean, he

19:42.080 --> 19:44.320
was all avoiding it, I mean, he was in that round, but then the Buddha said, well, somebody

19:44.320 --> 19:49.360
who's not in that round, he ends up in that position, they might quite likely give

19:49.360 --> 19:54.040
in, so then all the rules, they evolved around, in secluded with a woman, and so on, to

19:54.040 --> 19:59.040
be avoided, he was around the stories when he, you know, and they're quite a few times

19:59.040 --> 20:04.000
he's not able to come up, because he was clearly still attractive to the, to fit, to

20:04.000 --> 20:10.320
the woman, but he was in that round, so he wasn't entertaining it, nor was he all trying

20:10.320 --> 20:17.160
to seduce it, he's just, obviously, the other minds, they were still in kind of trapped

20:17.160 --> 20:22.000
by their own femininity, would find this form that comes in their range, a form of

20:22.000 --> 20:29.720
Wanderblum, or attractive, yeah, and then she tried to seduce that innkeeper, the woman

20:29.720 --> 20:34.720
yes, yeah, when she got rid of me, no, I'll don't say this crowded, I'll give you a secluded

20:34.720 --> 20:39.440
innkeeper, yeah, and then she got into special, but then she, when he did not respond to

20:39.440 --> 20:47.040
her advances, then she felt, oh, a bit ashamed, and then, well, actually impressed, because

20:47.040 --> 20:51.160
she said, oh, she was also good looking, according to her own account, because she said,

20:51.160 --> 20:55.960
many people tried to, you know, pay her wealth just to spend the night with her loads of,

20:55.960 --> 21:00.080
but here, look, I'm offering myself to this, this, this, this reckless, and he's not

21:00.080 --> 21:05.040
even looking at me, and then she dressed herself up, I apologize, and took a refuge in within

21:05.040 --> 21:11.880
a month, because she was inspired by it, doesn't know what a boy done with it, so, because

21:11.880 --> 21:19.440
there's this, let's suit, let's suit her about, a teleporter, the actor, yes, and yeah,

21:19.440 --> 21:25.040
he asked the Buddha, where will I be reborn, as an actor, the Buddha says, don't ask me that,

21:25.040 --> 21:29.240
he was the actor comedian, yeah, a comedian, yeah, you don't ask, so I think comedians,

21:29.240 --> 21:33.760
you know, asked the Buddha three times, and the Buddha said, no, no, no, you don't know

21:33.760 --> 21:42.520
this, and then he said, and the, he said, the other, other actors say that, because he's

21:42.520 --> 21:49.280
an actor comedian, he will be reborn, yeah, in the, in the realm of the laughing devours,

21:49.280 --> 21:54.600
and the Buddha said, I'm afraid not, you'll be born in the laughing hell, in the realm of

21:54.600 --> 22:00.840
the laughing hell, and he's like crying, because he was actually happy, yeah, now he found

22:00.840 --> 22:05.920
the right way that he shouldn't be, yeah, the Buddha thought he was crying, and he said,

22:05.920 --> 22:10.480
see, I told you don't ask me, because I knew, like, you know, he said, he said, no, no,

22:10.480 --> 22:15.080
no, no, I'm not crying, because I'm upset, I'm crying, because I'm not, I've been told

22:15.080 --> 22:19.880
the truth, finally, and like, I've been lied all this time, that by being a comedian,

22:19.880 --> 22:28.120
I'm going to be reborn in this comedic heaven, but, but now I know the truth, and that's

22:28.120 --> 22:34.800
when he went for, okay, and that's the Buddha said, you encourage others, agree, take

22:34.800 --> 22:41.600
the illusion, yeah, like basically, the minds of others, they're not free from greed

22:41.600 --> 22:47.160
aversion delusion, they come to watch you, and then you, with your mind, who's not free

22:47.160 --> 22:52.600
from greed aversion delusion, perform actions, they make them laugh, and make the greed aversion

22:52.600 --> 22:58.200
delusion increase, thus, like, basically, audience is full of greed aversion delusion,

22:58.200 --> 23:01.880
actor is full of greed aversion delusion, and the old result of it is more, increasing

23:01.880 --> 23:05.720
greed aversion delusion, like you're four or whatever, and that's just making things much

23:05.720 --> 23:13.240
worse, that they actually are, because, because people's happiness revolves around sensuality,

23:13.240 --> 23:18.960
more, more, you know, more adopted, so even comedy or whatever, just making happy, laughing

23:18.960 --> 23:22.840
through, through, basically, through distraction, through, through carelessness and so on,

23:22.840 --> 23:28.720
just bringing all the, all the assas, they're, they're already there to increase, all the

23:28.720 --> 23:37.400
tense, all the tense, yeah, good, let's think with this, let in keep a woman, okay,

23:37.400 --> 23:45.800
sure she went, she changed her ways, but encouraging, lasting others, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

23:45.800 --> 23:52.000
yeah, that is your responsibility, exactly, yeah, in the, yeah, exactly, yeah, you're developing

23:52.000 --> 23:58.760
your masculinity, in order to seduce it, to infect minds of others with more lust and

23:58.760 --> 24:03.640
aversion delusion, oh yeah, yeah, in that, in that way, yeah, oh yeah, that is, that, you

24:03.640 --> 24:08.440
know, because that is the content, that's intentional action, somebody setting on, seduce a woman,

24:08.440 --> 24:15.280
a woman, seduce a man, and then that results in their mind, being infected by lust, a

24:15.280 --> 24:23.200
version or delusion, that's all basically, well, there is a good deal of shared responsibility

24:23.200 --> 24:29.600
in that, yeah, I mean, their response of being ignorant in the first place, sure, for being

24:29.600 --> 24:33.720
in the main of lust, for keeping themselves in the main of lust, for giving into lust, because

24:33.720 --> 24:40.880
you can always say no, but obviously, the seduce has his own take, take of that, that, if

24:40.880 --> 24:48.360
you think of, like this actor, now you think, pornography, or pornography, well, that is

24:48.360 --> 24:55.320
like the course, yeah, yeah, that's the course, because that is just purely, solely based

24:55.320 --> 25:03.560
and aimed at, just lust, just fire of lust, yeah, so yeah, movies, music, no matter how meaningful

25:03.560 --> 25:09.960
it might be, the first facility is entertaining, purposefully this is basically fiction, taking

25:09.960 --> 25:16.600
my way, romance, romance, yeah, and also, you know, it's done selectively, you know,

25:16.600 --> 25:23.760
either romantic movie, you basically, you show the romantic things, romantic build up drama

25:23.760 --> 25:29.800
or whatever else, you don't actually show everything in a human life, because people

25:29.800 --> 25:34.800
probably gross by it, getting up, you know, having diarrhea, and then going meeting your

25:34.800 --> 25:40.200
loved one for coffee, and still having to run to a toilet, yeah, you show that in a movie,

25:40.200 --> 25:45.480
it would not be a romantic movie, but you only show the point of it, and that's not what

25:45.480 --> 25:52.280
life is, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

25:52.280 --> 26:03.960
I've heard it before, you've heard it as well, that to overcome these sexual desire, everyone

26:03.960 --> 26:14.960
should tease the defilements, tease the defilements, go near, you know, go visit woman, go, that is

26:14.960 --> 26:21.760
beyond stupid, that I would not even talk about it, give me something warm in, yeah, good,

26:21.760 --> 26:34.040
good, because I think some people think, to entertain those sexual energies is, you become

26:34.040 --> 26:42.080
stronger, basically, like, for example, the whole tantric practice in verticals, basically,

26:42.080 --> 26:47.720
people try to overcome it, one way or the other, and they can't, they have absolutely no

26:47.720 --> 26:54.320
idea how to, and then what did you, well, then they make a practice out of it, why, because

26:54.320 --> 26:58.880
then they will feel like no, no, this is the way, they will feel like they're overcoming

26:58.880 --> 27:06.000
it, overcoming the coarseness of sensuality, while still remaining very much engaging it,

27:06.000 --> 27:10.160
so they just end up the whole purpose of the whole thing, it's just to lie to yourself,

27:10.160 --> 27:16.440
to mask responsibility, to mask the failure, you're not able to send out your desire, you're

27:16.440 --> 27:22.880
not able to overcome the sensual domain, and say, no, it's not about overcoming, it's

27:22.880 --> 27:28.080
about whatever, engaging with it, teasing it, adding to it, you must not deny that energy,

27:28.080 --> 27:32.160
you know, only a person who cannot overcome it will say that, because otherwise, you'd

27:32.160 --> 27:37.800
have to admit to this of their weak, and they're not worthy, obviously, worthy of the goal

27:37.800 --> 27:44.720
that they themselves set forward, without declaring their weakness, exactly, without declaring

27:44.720 --> 27:48.920
it, and it would be actually much better if they would be authentic enough, transparent

27:48.920 --> 27:54.560
enough, to admit that their weak, no matter how bad it feels, why, because that bad feeling

27:54.560 --> 27:59.280
will, it might actually make them make proper effort further down the line, if they give

27:59.280 --> 28:03.920
in and cover it up and say, no, no, no, it's not about, this is not weakness, this is

28:03.920 --> 28:07.960
the strength, what, no, it's not, strength is giving up, you're not giving up, well,

28:07.960 --> 28:12.160
you're not supposed to give up, you're supposed to entertain it, well, that's only a weak

28:12.160 --> 28:16.000
person who would say that, a person who doesn't know how to give it up, and the only choice

28:16.000 --> 28:21.240
for him is to entertain it, so what he ends up doing is basically just say more before,

28:21.240 --> 28:27.520
entertain the sensuality, just kind of developing a different excuse for it, or a more elaborate,

28:27.520 --> 28:32.520
or a more meaningful background, like on a spiritual practice, otherwise, because he's just

28:32.520 --> 28:37.960
going to be very, very cold, you say the sense of shame disappears there, well it would,

28:37.960 --> 28:42.120
yeah, yeah, you got, become stronger than me, you cover it up, you cover the sense of shame,

28:42.120 --> 28:47.520
when you decide to cover the feeling of guilt for not being able to say no, and your sense

28:47.520 --> 28:52.320
of shame goes with it, when you cover it, you cover it, that's right, yeah, well that's

28:52.320 --> 29:00.160
taking to be a problem, yeah, sure, sure, yeah, we need not embarrass anymore, oh yeah,

29:00.160 --> 29:05.720
there is that practice, yeah, yeah, when you don't feel such a shame, doing shameful things,

29:05.720 --> 29:13.000
yeah, but you know, all this, all this sense of shame basically, it's no natural, it's

29:13.000 --> 29:18.880
the product of society, and you really going to be empowered if you ignore it, that it's

29:18.880 --> 29:23.040
shameful, and then just go ahead and do it, nobody's starting hard to live your life,

29:23.040 --> 29:27.560
so, and that is what, what, you know, modest society kind of encourages one way or the other,

29:27.560 --> 29:32.200
because again, the sense of shame bothers you, feeling of guilt bothers you, and then you

29:32.200 --> 29:35.640
blame others for it, you don't recognize it, there is a natural aspect to

29:35.640 --> 29:42.200
sense of shame, and feeling of guilt, sure, if the whole society is repressed, yeah, it's

29:42.200 --> 29:46.960
delusional, repressed, whatever else, but that doesn't mean you should deny the entire

29:46.960 --> 29:51.640
sense of shame on a personal level, because it is quite natural, and it would have said

29:51.640 --> 29:56.960
these are the natural protectors of the world, without the natural sense of shame, well,

29:56.960 --> 30:03.160
men would be like dogs, brothers would sleep with sisters, sisters with fathers, mothers

30:03.160 --> 30:12.240
with sons, just, just, they would be complete, complete disarray, but it bothers people,

30:12.240 --> 30:17.080
they don't know how to deal with it, they don't have any wisdom in regard to it, to recognize

30:17.080 --> 30:23.760
it, yeah, there is an overflow of like, shaming and guilt by the society, certain societies

30:23.760 --> 30:29.520
in some, I don't know, repressed countries or whatever else, but that doesn't mean that

30:29.520 --> 30:33.360
is the entire thing, there is the personal aspect of that sense of shame, because yeah, it's

30:33.360 --> 30:39.360
a shameful thing, it's a private thing, so, and people can't draw their line, they can

30:39.360 --> 30:43.160
sit there, so, when they rebel against it, they rebel against the whole thing, and they

30:43.160 --> 30:50.800
become utterly shameless, utterly shameless, oh, and you feel liberated, that's it, that's

30:50.800 --> 30:55.640
another world we've all liberated, because suddenly you feel free, it's basically like

30:55.640 --> 31:01.240
a liberation of, of just giving, opening the floodgains of the desire even more, or there's

31:01.240 --> 31:06.520
now, there's nothing stopping you, before you actually had that sense of shame, then

31:06.520 --> 31:10.120
you mistook it to be something that it isn't, you denied it, you made the effort to cover

31:10.120 --> 31:14.760
it, to destroy it, to ignore it, to rebel against it, and you feel liberated, it's a liberation

31:14.760 --> 31:22.520
of just outpour, which means, sure, it feels a relief when you open the gates, but you

31:22.520 --> 31:27.080
wouldn't feel a relief if you were to know what these floods are taking you, if they're

31:27.080 --> 31:31.320
taking you down the messy waterfall, you're gonna crash at the bottom, you will not feel

31:31.320 --> 31:36.880
a relief if somebody opens the gate, you will feel life threatening, and on the contrary,

31:36.880 --> 31:41.680
you would feel relieved if the gates stay closed, so you don't flow down the waterfall

31:41.680 --> 31:47.000
where you're gonna crash into death, but not knowing that, yeah, oh yeah, it's a joyous

31:47.000 --> 31:56.480
ride, until, oh, it's too late now, to swim back, because that's one approach, trying

31:56.480 --> 32:03.280
to escape such things, sensuality, he's, take tantric, he's tantric, Buddhism, tantric,

32:03.280 --> 32:09.360
you know, find some contradiction in terms, take it in terms of contradictions, and meditation,

32:09.360 --> 32:19.280
sensual celibacy, tantric Buddhism, Buddha, he goes on to carry, eat, carry a celibacy

32:19.280 --> 32:24.520
from a chariot, and there's a sutra on that, where he describes what that is, and someone

32:24.520 --> 32:30.080
would say this is the other extreme, like, completes the suppression, all these things

32:30.080 --> 32:34.800
aren't, you know, it's just not the strict, it is, absolutely, you're beating yourself

32:34.800 --> 32:39.320
out, you're not supposed to press the desires, because you see them, pointless, meaningless,

32:39.320 --> 32:45.360
insatiable, and only resulting in harm, in a long run, so yeah, by all means, suppress

32:45.360 --> 32:51.320
it, because through that suppression, wisdom might arise, one thing for sure, wisdom

32:51.320 --> 32:57.160
will not arise from giving it, so wisdom will not necessarily arise through somebody

32:57.160 --> 33:03.720
who is practicing full-on restraint, so wisdom will not necessarily arise just on that,

33:03.720 --> 33:09.200
but it can, and one thing for sure, it cannot arise if there is no basis of restraint,

33:09.200 --> 33:14.240
that's another sutra that we said, even if somebody spends the whole life without kind

33:14.240 --> 33:18.640
of developing any wisdom, just through sheer restraint and saying no to desires, and even

33:18.640 --> 33:23.160
if they go through extreme pains because of that, and spend the whole life in tears for

33:23.160 --> 33:29.840
the rest of their life, it's still much better than giving in, like just once, because

33:29.840 --> 33:36.240
in a long run, again, you spend years, forcefully, for somebody who is no wisdom, keeping

33:36.240 --> 33:43.320
the mind away from giving into centrality, and that's making lots of merit, because

33:43.320 --> 33:48.560
you know, people think merit for the future life is just through giving, no, that was

33:48.560 --> 33:52.960
the lowest aspect, because they said yeah, through giving to one person, to the Buddha,

33:52.960 --> 33:56.960
to the Buddha, to the other hand, to the Sangha, give more, but none of that would equal

33:56.960 --> 34:01.600
the amount of merit, the streams of merit, you would make it like if you develop a finger

34:01.600 --> 34:08.200
snap of a right view, a finger snap of freedom from centrality, a finger snap of non-cruelty,

34:08.200 --> 34:13.000
finger snap of loving kind, a finger snap, so somebody for a whole lifetime, that's

34:13.000 --> 34:16.080
what meant when I said in the beginning, it's actually, even if somebody doesn't want

34:16.080 --> 34:21.960
to, in the Arab or whatever, it would be much better if they would practice celibacy,

34:21.960 --> 34:27.080
they would say no to sexual desire, the mind would already grow by itself, just through

34:27.080 --> 34:32.280
that, let alone if they make extra effort to gain wisdom, and they are, yeah, even if

34:32.280 --> 34:37.560
it's painful for the rest of your life, so what, this is what means in the 50, 60 years,

34:37.560 --> 34:41.440
how many years have you been reborn, how many years you will be reborn on account of

34:41.440 --> 34:47.280
that, 50 years of crying your eyes out because of the pain and restring, nothing, they will

34:47.280 --> 34:56.080
up in smoke, no time, yeah, the pain of restraint to the feeble of centrality, yeah, yeah, that's

34:56.080 --> 35:01.680
like, you know, the most of the matter you can imagine, just practicing centrality strength,

35:01.680 --> 35:08.680
non-cruelty towards people, non-identity, you say no to desires for the rest of your life,

35:08.680 --> 35:14.080
what about, yeah, eons of heavenly rebirth, because those are the mental states, they will

35:14.080 --> 35:22.840
take you there, but maybe I'm, if I have children, giving them opportunity to, to hear the

35:22.840 --> 35:29.320
dumb, no, I don't follow that, what, people have children, they want to give, I've heard

35:29.320 --> 35:35.520
it before, that you want to give other beings, no, sorry, so they have children, in order

35:35.520 --> 35:42.240
for those children to later have opportunity to hear the dumb, yeah, well that sounds, sounds

35:42.240 --> 35:52.320
like a terrible excuse, how about, because there is no guarantee you're going to become

35:52.320 --> 35:58.000
an arrogant, even if you hear the dumb, so hearing the dumb in itself can be quite meaningless,

35:58.000 --> 36:02.840
if a person doesn't know how to attend to it or doesn't want to, thus you can say to those

36:02.840 --> 36:06.880
people who want to have children, you know, the children to hear the dumb maybe, it would

36:06.880 --> 36:14.320
be better if they become arrogant themselves, so instead of optional remote possibility

36:14.320 --> 36:19.040
of somebody becoming an arrogant by hearing the dumb in the future, they can become arrogant

36:19.040 --> 36:26.760
themselves, and I mean one less than samsara, and that's the most you can do, but obviously

36:26.760 --> 36:41.760
there is a much harder to do that than to produce a child.

36:41.760 --> 37:08.960
So go and read the sutra on celibacy.

37:08.960 --> 37:15.960
So then a Brahman, Janasuni, approached the blessed one and exchanged, weeding with him,

37:15.960 --> 37:23.040
and said to him, does Master Gautama also claim to be one who lives the celibid life?

37:23.040 --> 37:29.000
In the Buddha replies, if Brahman one could rightly say of anyone, he lives the complete

37:29.000 --> 37:35.640
and pure celibid life, unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unstained, it is precisely of

37:35.640 --> 37:41.480
me that one might say this, for I live the complete and pure celibid life, unbroken,

37:41.480 --> 37:45.480
flawless, unblemished, unstained.

37:45.480 --> 37:51.560
But what Master Gautama is a breached flaw, a blemish and a stain of the celibid life?

37:51.560 --> 37:59.320
He's here, Brahman, some ascetic, or Brahman, claiming to be perfectly celibid, does

37:59.320 --> 38:05.040
not actually engage in intercourse, sexual intercourse with women, but he consents to being rubbed,

38:05.040 --> 38:08.280
massaged, bathed by them.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.960
He relishes this, desires it, and finds satisfaction in it.

38:11.960 --> 38:17.000
This is a breached, a flaw, a blemish and a stain of the celibid life.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.200
He's called one who lives an impure celibid life, one who is feted by the bond of sexuality.

38:23.200 --> 38:28.560
He's not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief

38:28.560 --> 38:36.240
and despair, he's not freed from suffering, I say.

38:36.240 --> 38:40.400
Again some ascetic or Brahman claiming to be perfectly celibid, does not actually engage

38:40.400 --> 38:45.440
in intercourse with women, does not, nor does he consent to being rubbed, massaged, but

38:45.440 --> 38:50.480
he jokes with women, plays with them, and amuses himself with them.

38:50.480 --> 38:54.320
Or he does not joke with women, play with them, and amuses himself with them, but he gazes

38:54.320 --> 38:59.440
and stays straight into their eyes, or he does not gaze and stays straight into the woman's

38:59.440 --> 39:05.720
eyes, but he listens to their voices behind a wall, or through a rampart as they laugh,

39:05.720 --> 39:11.160
talk, sing a weep, or he does not listen to their voices, voices of women behind a

39:11.160 --> 39:18.960
wall, but he recollects laughing, talking and playing with them in the past, or he does

39:18.960 --> 39:24.280
not recollect laughing, talking and playing with them in the past, but he looks at a household

39:24.280 --> 39:31.080
order, enjoying himself furnished and endowed with five objects of central pleasure.

39:31.080 --> 39:36.280
Or he does not look at a householder, enjoying himself furnished and endowed with five objects

39:36.280 --> 39:41.880
of central pleasure, but he lives the spiritual life, aspiring for rebirth in a certain

39:41.880 --> 39:50.360
order of David's thinking, by this virtuous behaviour, observance and austerity, or spiritual

39:50.360 --> 39:56.720
life, I will be a David, or one in the retinue of the David's, he relishes this desire and

39:56.720 --> 39:59.560
desires it and finds satisfaction in it.

39:59.560 --> 40:03.760
This too is a breach, a flaw, a blemish, and a stain of the celibate life.

40:03.760 --> 40:11.200
Of the perfect celibate life, that is because now people might think of him and I must

40:11.200 --> 40:16.040
not do anything, but it's actually better to at least be virtuous even if you are desiring

40:16.040 --> 40:21.600
for the sake of rebirth than to be engaging in sexuality, because as that sort of a venerable

40:21.600 --> 40:27.600
nanda was struggling and wanted to disrobe, and the Buddha said, why do you want to disrobe?

40:27.600 --> 40:30.400
He said, well, there was this servant girl, there was quite pretty and she told me when

40:30.400 --> 40:32.960
I come back, she will be waiting for me.

40:32.960 --> 40:40.160
And then he showed him the beauty of the Davas, there was 500 names, whatever it was in

40:40.160 --> 40:46.120
the service, and then he said, which is prettier, the names, or that servant girl, and he said,

40:46.120 --> 40:51.240
well, the names, the servant girl is like a culturalized monkey, with ears bent off,

40:51.240 --> 40:55.640
there's nothing comparison, he said, okay, well I can guarantee you, you're going to

40:55.640 --> 41:01.760
have those names, they were names, if you practice the legacy for the rest of your life,

41:01.760 --> 41:05.520
there will be your rebirth, and then he was like, okay, well, I'll do that, then you

41:05.520 --> 41:10.800
go on motivation, however, sometime later the monks heard that, and then they were basically

41:10.800 --> 41:15.320
looking out upon him and he felt ashamed, and then he actually made the effort properly

41:15.320 --> 41:20.720
and became an adult, but yeah, it is better, even if you're desiring heaven, it is better

41:20.720 --> 41:29.200
than committing the kind of animal-like sexuality in this world, it's not perfect, and the

41:29.200 --> 41:36.200
sutra deals with perfect celebrities, so it's not perfect, so nobody says, oh, it's fine,

41:36.200 --> 41:39.440
but you do need, like a person needs to distinguish, it's not on the same footing as having

41:39.440 --> 41:44.080
sexual integrals, or allowing women to rub you, or you're rubbing them, or listening to

41:44.080 --> 41:48.880
them, or talking to them, or depending on their company, all of this, they fantasizing

41:48.880 --> 41:58.640
about that, if you can't give it all up, when at least do it like the last way, think

41:58.640 --> 42:04.280
about heaven and practice rebirth for that, practice restraint for that sake of better rebirth,

42:04.280 --> 42:11.520
it's still better, not ultimate, but better, because it sounds like repression, if you

42:11.520 --> 42:16.040
really, you know, it is, it is repression, but it's just people, it's repression, yeah,

42:16.040 --> 42:22.680
it is, so what, you are in a position to repress, in the same sense, like giving in, well,

42:22.680 --> 42:29.320
it's, it's, it's, it's, what's the opposite of repression, well, giving in, I don't

42:29.320 --> 42:35.680
do this, I guess it does, yeah, oh, this is just repressing, yes, you're, you're fighting

42:35.680 --> 42:40.480
against some sort, the Buddha said you're going against the grain, yeah, that's exactly

42:40.480 --> 42:43.920
what repression is, there's nothing wrong with it, sure, if you go mad and lose it while

42:43.920 --> 42:48.360
you're too weak, the grain you were trying to resist it, then you just swept you, tough

42:48.360 --> 42:53.000
luck, so you make yourself stronger, but one thing for sure, you never become stronger

42:53.000 --> 43:02.920
if you practice no repression, no restraint, yeah, if you're strained, such, and fear of repression

43:02.920 --> 43:08.680
is really just fear of going against centrality, fear of saying no to yourself, no to your

43:08.680 --> 43:15.680
own mind, because if you say no, it might rebel and basically drive you mad, which kind

43:15.680 --> 43:19.160
of reveals contradiction, which means that mind is not yours, yet you regard it very much

43:19.160 --> 43:24.120
as yours, yet you're afraid to say no to it, but being mind means you're in full control

43:24.120 --> 43:29.160
of it, supposedly, but if you can't say no to yourself, means you're not in full control

43:29.160 --> 43:33.120
of it, thus that's not your mind, thus you should really be afraid when you're giving

43:33.120 --> 43:39.760
into it, yeah, it's a scary man knocking on your door, and you're afraid to leave the

43:39.760 --> 43:46.400
door closed, because he might break it in, but so you open the door, and then you let

43:46.400 --> 43:51.800
him in, and that's even worse, it's absolutely no resistance there, because who knows, he

43:51.800 --> 43:55.800
might not be able to break the door if you don't turn it a bit strong, if you learn how

43:55.800 --> 44:01.800
to fortify before he breaks it, one thing for sure, if you let him in, then you're in his

44:01.800 --> 44:05.600
mercy, or maybe he'll take me to put it the good way, maybe he'll take, maybe he won't

44:05.600 --> 44:11.880
harm me, maybe, maybe, similarly, he will harm you, and that's what we said, was it the

44:11.880 --> 44:17.880
assassins, the sixth, the sixth is like the assassin, the mind, the dearest, like a dearest

44:17.880 --> 44:22.040
friend that you trust with your life, and then he kills you in your sleep, that's like

44:22.040 --> 44:27.680
the nature of a pleasant relationship with that mind, you never question a mind, your

44:27.680 --> 44:32.920
own mind as your own enemy, you don't see it as a dangerous assassin, it's just trying

44:32.920 --> 44:57.800
to get your sort of your friendship, your trust, and then kill you, at the end of that

44:57.800 --> 45:08.280
day, the Buddha still says, but when I did not see even one of these seven bonds of sexuality

45:08.280 --> 45:12.680
that had not been abandoned, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfecting

45:12.680 --> 45:16.840
enlightenment in this world, the knowledge and vision arose in me, unshakable is my

45:16.840 --> 45:24.960
liberation of mind, this is my last birth, now there is no more renewed existence, when

45:24.960 --> 45:38.880
you saw that it was perfectly sober, the mind was completely drawn from it, but again,

45:38.880 --> 45:48.960
those trying to perfect those points, you know, not even looking in a woman's eyes, there's

45:48.960 --> 45:54.400
that time that the Buddha says, if you do, if you have to look, you have to look, again,

45:54.400 --> 45:59.640
all of that, I mean, you know, the Buddha was talking with women and queens and whatever

45:59.640 --> 46:04.880
else would come to me, so you have to understand that this is all these acts are not to be done

46:04.880 --> 46:09.480
if they are rooted in sexuality, so again, don't just deny everything and cover your

46:09.480 --> 46:14.360
eyes and run away if there is just a woman on the other side of the road, that's just

46:14.360 --> 46:18.680
neurotic really, I mean, in the beginning, you should do it if you can't differentiate,

46:18.680 --> 46:24.800
but don't hold that to be the perfect behavior, because one way or the other, you're running

46:24.800 --> 46:30.280
away from it, which means it's bothering you, which means you're not free from it.

46:30.280 --> 46:35.320
So all of this refers to when you're doing it for the sake of basically a sexual desire,

46:35.320 --> 46:40.000
then it doesn't go to the point of sexual intercourse, but then you're like, oh, in touch

46:40.000 --> 46:44.360
for the sexual desire, and maybe you don't let them touch you, but then you could talk

46:44.360 --> 46:49.440
to them, you'd shout them up just for the enjoyment of sexual desire, then you might be talking

46:49.440 --> 46:53.080
to them, then you're listening to them, looking at them, listening to them, fantasizing

46:53.080 --> 46:59.560
about them, but if that's not rooted anymore, you obviously wouldn't be fantasizing about

46:59.560 --> 47:04.680
them, and if you were to talk to them for whatever reason, it wouldn't be rooted in that

47:04.680 --> 47:14.680
like, a sexuality in the design for sex, you just thought it wouldn't be rooted in that.

47:14.680 --> 47:17.160
It might seem a bit rude to people as well.

47:17.160 --> 47:22.520
Well, yeah, and sometimes it might be, and that's, again, you recognize, okay, so I'm

47:22.520 --> 47:30.280
not supposed to, you know, be neurotic about it, but it's better to start a bit neurotic,

47:30.280 --> 47:38.480
that's even not, then to start a bit loose, so if, during your neurotic phase, you might

47:38.480 --> 47:44.760
be rude, it's okay, take, take, you know, on the responsibility for it, but, but recognize

47:44.760 --> 47:50.560
it, okay, well, it's just a side, it's a fact of, of the current behaviour I'm engaging

47:50.560 --> 47:56.120
in, which is like extra slightly neurotic restraint, so it's rude, but it's okay, I can live

47:56.120 --> 48:02.040
with it, better to be rude, with a prospect of enlightenment, then polite, and ignorant.

48:02.040 --> 48:07.960
I'm not just saying rude behaviour, by the way, but I'm just saying, if you recognize,

48:07.960 --> 48:13.960
yeah, some people just rude, because they care less, but this is different.

48:13.960 --> 48:24.800
Yeah, not to encourage it as well, and others, because you can also, it might be coming from

48:24.800 --> 48:32.400
you, but you see the mind of the other is infected, by the loss, yeah, that was the point of

48:32.400 --> 48:35.680
the, of all those, like, I'm rude, it was an art, he wouldn't have, he couldn't have

48:35.680 --> 48:41.360
engaged in any sexual activity with that woman, but would have said, but if any other who

48:41.360 --> 48:45.720
was not an art and was in that circumstances, he most definitely would have, so that's

48:45.720 --> 48:52.640
why you prevent the circumstance, however, again, you must not neglect, and you must

48:52.640 --> 48:59.200
not ignore the fact that it's all for the purpose of developing wisdom, because there is

48:59.200 --> 49:05.200
no end then, to try to, to try to kind of say no to circumstances, and then you just

49:05.200 --> 49:12.280
become ridiculous, and then people justify it all because it's the restraint, not necessarily.

49:12.280 --> 49:17.520
If you're doing it out of, as we spoke before, you know, there is the obviously strength,

49:17.520 --> 49:22.760
but then if you're just going out of this, this is like insane, ridiculous random measures,

49:22.760 --> 49:28.280
like what giants used to do, and you just clearly, just you can see how it evolved,

49:28.280 --> 49:33.240
irrationally, where they would go to arms, arms, and then obviously get the food, but then

49:33.240 --> 49:37.760
you just felt too indulgent, then you take food only out of that, and after every third

49:37.760 --> 49:43.600
house, then you don't take food on the, on the person on the right side of the crossroads,

49:43.600 --> 49:46.800
then you don't take food from a woman, then you don't, no, you don't take food from a

49:46.800 --> 49:50.040
woman, then you don't take food from a woman, then you don't take food, then you take

49:50.040 --> 49:54.720
food every, then you don't take food at all, this is just ridiculous, and yet that's

49:54.720 --> 49:58.640
often the attitude people might have, they might not take it in that regard, but when

49:58.640 --> 50:03.520
it comes to like saying no, and just fear, and then just no to this, no to this, no

50:03.520 --> 50:09.680
reason, then it becomes ridiculous, but it's, it's saying easy, it's completely irrational,

50:09.680 --> 50:18.480
and by giving in, by encouraging that irrational behavior, you forget that your, the response,

50:18.480 --> 50:24.440
well, your responsibility is to develop wisdom on the basis of restraint that you are practicing,

50:24.440 --> 50:28.440
so you forget about that dimension, and all you end up doing is investing more effort

50:28.440 --> 50:35.640
in just restraining your restraint, there is no need to push it further, leave it, because

50:35.640 --> 50:40.240
you are restrained, leave it, and now do the work, now just exactly, now do the work, now

50:40.240 --> 50:47.640
just go back and keep tightening already things that are already tight enough, because

50:47.640 --> 50:58.920
that restraint obviously was not, not fantasizing about sexual behavior, is a world reveal that

50:58.920 --> 51:06.240
craving to go in that direction, that's the need for that pleasure, it will just be revealed

51:06.240 --> 51:10.600
if you're looking for it, it will show you straight away, but if all you're looking for

51:10.600 --> 51:16.560
is the next step for your restraint after this completely restrained, every aspect yet

51:16.560 --> 51:20.760
you then just keep okay, restraint further, and further, you'll never stop and look back

51:20.760 --> 51:36.360
and see what the real problem is, the craving, the desire, the ignorance, you're which

51:36.360 --> 51:45.200
was always the problem, and just to read that suitably, he spoke about in the beginning,

51:45.200 --> 51:52.720
called a union and disengagement, because I will teach you a Dharma exposition on union

51:52.720 --> 52:00.640
and disengagement, listen, and what is a Dharma exposition on union and disengagement?

52:00.640 --> 52:06.840
A woman attends internally to her feminine faculty, her feminine comportment, her feminine

52:06.840 --> 52:14.120
appearance, her feminine aspect, her feminine desire, her feminine voice, her feminine ornaments,

52:14.120 --> 52:20.160
she becomes exited by these and takes delight in them, excited by them, taking delight in

52:20.160 --> 52:25.920
them, she attends externally to a man's masculine faculty, his masculine comportment, his

52:25.920 --> 52:31.600
masculine appearance, his masculine aspect, his masculine desire, his masculine forays, his

52:31.600 --> 52:37.360
masculine ornaments, she becomes excited by these and takes delight in them, excited by

52:37.360 --> 52:43.480
them, take delight in them, she desires union externally, and she also desires the pleasure

52:43.480 --> 52:47.360
pleasure and joy that arise on account of such union.

52:47.360 --> 52:52.920
Beings who are delighted with their femininity enter upon union with men.

52:52.920 --> 53:01.040
It is in this way that a woman does not transcend her femininity and likewise with a man.

53:01.040 --> 53:06.800
And the opposite where she doesn't attend to her femininity, then there's disengagement.

53:06.800 --> 53:07.800
Exactly.

53:07.800 --> 53:16.200
It's not entertaining the basis for all those things, because I delight in the femininity.

53:16.200 --> 53:25.640
So instead of blaming men or men blaming women, just uproot the delight in your own manliness

53:25.640 --> 53:34.920
or in your own femininity, uproot it, you have to deny it.

53:34.920 --> 53:44.000
There was that sort of a monk couldn't free himself from, oh no, I think that was in the rules.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.120
I know, I think it was the suit actually.

53:46.120 --> 53:55.400
When he couldn't free himself from central desire, so he kind of started going mad and he cut his sexual organ off.

53:55.400 --> 54:00.720
And he said foolish, instead of cutting one thing, he cut a wrong thing.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.640
Cutting the ignorance.

54:02.640 --> 54:15.040
Yeah, because that's not your masculine, ignorance in regard to the masculine form, is masculine.

54:15.040 --> 54:29.360
So you can have all the masculine form you want, if you're not ignorant in regard to it, if you're not delighting it, if you see it as impermanent, if you see it as not personal, not dear to it, not yours, not internally held, same for a woman.

54:29.360 --> 54:46.480
Because you're whatever you've born, you'll always be that. Exactly. And it wasn't yours to begin with, actually.

54:46.480 --> 54:54.160
Because if you were to truly own that form, you wouldn't age, you wouldn't get sick, you wouldn't die.

54:54.160 --> 55:01.960
He has its own cause, basically. You're just interfering with it.

55:01.960 --> 55:31.760
And their cause is the cause of impermanent.
