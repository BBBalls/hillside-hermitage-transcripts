00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What is your permanence?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
That's it.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
A rising is manifest.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
In the soupers, it says,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
a rising is manifested,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
ceasing is manifested,

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
possessing or changing is manifested.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
So, I don't want to repeat myself,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
but basically,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
impermanence pertains to that manifested bit.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
So, he won't be found

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
in actual arising, or ceasing,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
or possessing or changing, because those things

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
are all phenomena.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
And impermanence pertains to the nature

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
of the phenomena.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Presisting or changing is a phenomena.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, enduring. Well, a rising

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
is already possessing or changing.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
You don't see the actual origin of the thing.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
The point, I mean the exact split second.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
No, you just have a thing origin.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Which means, whether it's a rising,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
or whether it's ceasing,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
it's like fading in and fading out.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
And fading in, it's only the form of endurance.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
It's the same thing that it's increasing in its presence.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
But it's the same thing.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
So, it's persisting.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
As the same thing,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
while it's changing, I increase in its presence.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And same goes for fading out.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
And same goes for fading out.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
For decreasing in its presence.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
But the point is,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
whether you're witnessing

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
which your senses,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
arising of something like

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
manifestation of a thing,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
or something just disappeared.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Both of those things arise for you

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
in your experience.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
So, when you're looking at the actual

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
disappearance of something,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
that is appearing for you.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
So, the disappearance in a particular level,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
external level.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
But as an experience,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
it's actually arising.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
It's appearing for you.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
It's manifesting for you.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
But it's that confusion that I spoke before

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
between the users of arising and the rising.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Like, you should really distinguish between the rising,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
ceasing, persisting, or changing,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
and word manifesting.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Because arising is manifested.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Ceasing is manifested.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Persisting, or changing is manifested.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
So, from that point of view,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
ceasing arises.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Persisting, or changing arises.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
All right, appears.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So, seeing is always,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
and is always,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
impermanence pertains to that

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
manifestation.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
To that level,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
doesn't pertain to you having to witness a destruction

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
and disappearance of a thing in order for you to know the impermanence.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And even the Sotapana's insight says,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
whatever has the nature of arising

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
has the nature of ceasing.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And knowing the nature means actually

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
so far from seeing it being destroyed in order to realize the impermanence,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
you actually need it to be

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
a reason in order to see it as impermanent.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
So, that's why people have a problem.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
People who think the practice is like denying,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
nothing's real, nothing exists,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
see the science, show this is only a journey.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
They basically never allow things to manifest.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Or, are they? I mean,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
you can't really stop them from manifesting.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
But they never discern the fact that things manifest

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
because they're too busy denying them.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
As a result of that,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
well, they just completely cover up

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
any possibility of understanding

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
what the real impermanence is,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
the impermanence that matters.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
The impermanence, which, if you were to understand,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
is pretty different suffering.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, what about impermanence?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
So, things

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
a thing is a vision,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
always. There's always this thing of vision,

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
like the fiber,

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
I hope it's art.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
There's always the thing manifested.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah. Manifested experience is

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
so that general experience.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
The only thing is that the design manifested

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
isn't bug.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Is it?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah, the unborn needs, like,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
that's something

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
that the ultimate, like,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
negative of your experience is there.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But it doesn't manifest

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
in a sense of everything else manifests.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It's like a negative.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
For abandoning everything else,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
you develop nibbana.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
But you can't just go into nibbana

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
because there will be another thing.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
The most general level

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
of experience,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
a thing.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
So, exactly. So, for as long as you have

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
the fiber aggregates,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
there's always something manifested.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
That's why.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Well, Buddha before he became the Buddha,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
a rising and falling,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I mean, manifestations

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
of any kind of the five aggregates.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So, on the most general level,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
he was contemplating the nature of a rising means

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
nature of ceasing because he has a reason.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And he became the Buddha,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
just to that contemplation.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So, exactly. Whether you witness,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
unless your aggregates break apart,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
any experience that you witness,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
that you go through,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
that you experience,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
even if it's a destruction of every single thing in the world,

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
even if it's a destruction of your own senses,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
then arises for you.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
That disappearance appears for you

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
as disappearance of those things.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Because things arise,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
or rather, everything is discerned

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
and arises on the level of the mind.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
That's why the mind comes first.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
That's why I have to understand impermanence.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, in order to understand impermanence,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
you have to discern the

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
arising of things,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
their manifestation.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
You have to discern the nature of their manifestation.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And that's it.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
If you see that they manifest,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
and you have absolutely,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
it's inconceivable for you

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
to have any say in their manifestation.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
That is just like you completely,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
it's inaccessible.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
You cannot possibly,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
even conceive it

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
in the utmost obstruction,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
how it would be.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
The mind cannot go there.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Because of that, you know,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
for this very reason,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
that I have no say in their manifestation,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
that's why things are impermanent.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That's why things are this,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
that's why they cannot be,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
myself.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Impossible.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
So it's not that you need to figure out

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
that what not self means,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
means by seeing impermanence correctly for what it is,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
that's automatically the experience of not self.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
It's the same.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
It's the same thing.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Well,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
it's a different thing,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
but it's basically the same experience,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
that consists of the different things.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
It's within the same thing.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Because,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
always like when people,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
when you read the sutras,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
or any contemporary Buddhist,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
whatever,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
interpretations,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
you just assume,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
oh, impermanence, impermanence,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
you must see a rise.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Yes, and then you look for the impermanence.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
But that's why lots of people

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
really commit to it.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
The end of experience

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
and I thought I was speaking from experience,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
because,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
no matter how much,

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
you might even destroy things that mean to you,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
just to show,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
but actually that's another arising

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
of another experience.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And it's the experience that is impermanent.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
That's what Nietzsche means,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
not the actual things.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Because,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
as one of the wrong views

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
of the Western science,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
and I remember we studied that from chemistry.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So, like, nothing can get destroyed.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
It's only the energy,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and the molecules just changed the shape.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
So, I've got the names.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I don't want to get them wrong,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
but it was the name of that law in the early commerce,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
which was basically like,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
when you burn,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
say, you burn a piece of wood,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
well, that energy,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
that,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
that object,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
it's formed now.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So, now it's smoke, and I think that's transmuted.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Well, it's basically like,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
it's impossible to destroy the matter.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Uh-huh.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And see, like, from a completely wrong view,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
they kind of arrived

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
at the outside of what I'm talking about.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
When you realize,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
because basically matter,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
or not matter,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
the only way you can know matter is through your experience.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Now with the scientists, they deny

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
the personal experience, they generally project it outside as,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
it's a matter.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It's a genuine matter that they are accessing and dealing with,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
not their experience, or it.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
So then they say, oh, it's a genuine matter that you cannot destroy.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
But basically what they're saying is,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
even the destruction is another experience for you,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
so you can't destroy your experience.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Mm-hmm.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And Buddha goes even further, saying, even death

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
would not be a destruction of your experience,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
because you continue.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So, only Aravan truly destroys the experience,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
how, by abandoning it,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
but seeing that he could have not,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
that he could have not have owned it.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
He could have not had owned it.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, one or the other.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
He could have, I think, he could have not owned it.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I think that's the best thing.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
No matter what.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
And fully understanding that,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
he just, like, he automatically let's go.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
No, no, no, you're not.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Automatically, it's abandoned.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So that's what I mean.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
You discern, oh, it's arising.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, no, sorry.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Through manifestation,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
or through something that is present,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
you can all, it's arising.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
It's increasing that very manifestation,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
that's already manifested.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Or it's decreasing that very manifestation,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
it's all remembered.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's just both, oh,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
the manifestation isn't using still

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
of the same thing.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
But you don't, like, concern yourself

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
with moments of it's arising,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
moments of his cessation,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
because it's a completely wrong view,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
and you can't even see those things.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Because all you're seeing is your own experience

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
of those things.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And that experience is manifested.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
So then you're assuming yourself

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
as, like,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
external to it,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
and then observing of its linear progression,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
linear kind of endurance in time,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
whereby it fingerizes, oh, it's still there,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
and now it's gone.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
But see, you left yourself completely out.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
If you wanted to.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It's irrelevant.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And you also fail to see that even now,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
the experience of now this thing is gone,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
that is present for you.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
But your mind is out concerned

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
with that external object of your senses,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
and you generally believe

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
that now it's gone.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
But actually, it's not gone.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
For as long as you'd be thinking about it,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
and exist in you, like, well,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
even for as long as your five aggregates exist

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
with this intact memory in the mind,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
that thing has its form,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
it has a form of its presence.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Even if you can't find its material counterpart anymore,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
or other material aspects,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
it's not exactly counterpart.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Which is how you can still think about people

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
that are dying,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
or they're gone, things that have been destroyed,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
they haven't.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
That's the thing.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
As a phenomenon, those things are still

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
manifesting in your experience.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
The projection of the matter and stuff,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
whatever else wrong views people might have,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
where you think the world exists

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
independent of you, or you exist independent of the world,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
or both of neither,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
or you're confused in regard to it,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
then, yeah, you will believe that

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
this material aspect is the thing,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
but then, see,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
then you can't account for your thinking of it

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
when that matter disappears.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
But the thing was never in the matter,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
nor was never in your mind,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
in your consciousness.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
So now it's that very absence of that matter,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
there stands for the matter

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
of that thing when you think about it,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
a negative matter.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Ah, this, my favourite thing,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
is gone.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
It used to be right here.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
So now the empty space

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
becomes the material aspect

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
of the matter you're thinking about,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
because it was always name and matter.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
But the views that people have,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
projects give the priority

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
to the matter,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
which is why you keep looking for the destruction

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
of the matter to find the proof

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
for impermanence.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
But there's no external proof for impermanence,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
because that's another thing that arises,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
and the another thing that you can take to be permanent.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
So the proof

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
for impermanence

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
is in a rising of thing,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
or rather, yeah,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
the proof for things

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
in permanence in its nature

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
would be in the nature of that

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
manifestation.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So things are impermanent,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
now because you can observe the destruction,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
things are impermanent

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
because they have a reason

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
in the first place.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
That's why they will have to cease.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, beyond your control.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Like inconceivable.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Because you can still concede a formal control.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
You say, oh, this is beyond my control.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
But you can see a sense of control

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
in regard to that.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
If you really drilled this deep enough,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
it becomes inconceivable

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
even in that remote sense.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Because all you're going to find is

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
these things manifested.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And then through that manifestation,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
you can discern how it's arising,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
how it's persisting,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
how it's changing.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
It's manifesting.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
That's the bottom line.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And it's right there where you can see

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
because it's manifested.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And even the word manifest,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
to do with you, just it's there.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
For that very reason,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
you won't be there.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Not because you can destroy it,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
not because others,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
simply because it came

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
uninvited.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
That's the whole existence here.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
That's the nature of the five aggregates.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
To arise and fall.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
To be manifested.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
To be manifested.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Until they break apart.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
And that's why in regard to the five aggregates,

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
you establish that assumption.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
That they are used,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
that you are theirs,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
or whatever they're using control.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Basically, that's how opadana gets involved with,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
in regard to the five aggregates.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
But you can't really

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
if the five aggregates are not opadana,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
but there's no opadana without the five aggregates.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Let's chew a little bit.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I think.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They are indifferent to you,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
the five aggregates.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
They go their own course.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
But it's interference due to the like,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
ignorance.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Not knowing that you cannot interfere.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
That lack of knowledge is the form of interference.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And that interference,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
in regard to them, can't really change a five aggregates

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
or do anything with them.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
But it can certainly feel the assumption that you are,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
that you are in control, that they're used,

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
that they belong to you, that whatever else.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But all they do is manifest.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
And because they manifest, they cease.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So, in terms of...

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
I know we can go there to suit the 35, isn't it?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Which one?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Imagine me coming in.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Which one?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I think the 35.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
The one with...

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Do you see this?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
39.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
What's this?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I started with the...

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I know.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
First I'm assuming,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
consciousness gets reborn.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And consciousness passes on from life to life to life.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And he says, that's what the Buddha taught.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Well, this is about the venerable astrology.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
That's a 35.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah, but 39.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I think...

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
But it's right after something.

16:30.000 --> 16:44.000
I do remember that.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
38.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
It's like, do you see?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Because this has got to be.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It's 38.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
It's...

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
It's...

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It's a big sati.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Is it some of the...

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Is it some of the fishmen?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
It's some of the fishmen.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So, what about it?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Well, it is...

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
What started with...

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
He has the view that consciousness gets reborn.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Yeah.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
He thinks it's the same consciousness that runs him on this

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
through the rounds of rebirths,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
but it's not another.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It's the...

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
inexperience.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
Things just are.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
And so, to assume that you've...

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
To explain...

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Well, the only way you can think is to assume it.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Because it's inconceivable.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Yes.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It's inconceivable to...

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Like, you can't even conceive...

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Like, the rebirth.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
In a sense of something would be...

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Like, ignorant manifestations.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Like, things are manifesting to...

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Your five vibrigates.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Try your life and experience.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
And you have ignorance in regard to that.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And you base these external assumptions.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And then you think, oh, I must be this.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That's passing to the next life.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
But everything, even this.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Even the idea of this.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And the idea of the next life.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
And the idea of passing.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
All of that is already fully affected.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Like, fundamentals of your own experience.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
From the very start.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But he's...

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
He's used...

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
This passing point between this life and the next life.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It doesn't exist.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
But there's still the passing from this consciousness to that.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Which is a thing in itself.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
It's a thing in itself.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
The limbo is another realm.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
So to speak.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
If you pass from this life into limbo.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Well, that's another thing.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Between lives.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Well, that's not life.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
So there's always...

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
So the manifestation of the aggregates continues.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And you can discern it.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
That's what the Buddha said.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
No matter how many lifetimes somebody can remember.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Whether it's one, five, five hundred, five thousand.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
All they're going to remember is a rising and passing.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
The manifestation of the five aggregates of one particular among them.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
They won't...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
They can't imagine...

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
No, because there's a link between...

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
That's another thing, yeah.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
In between exists only between the two things.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
And that in between is the third thing.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
As in between.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
As a negative of the both things, it's a thing.

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
That's a meant that even the absence of a material aspect

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
of a certain thing that you're thinking of,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
that absence is a thing.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
That's why space is often listed

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
as one of the... one of the great elements.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
With consciousness.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
So you have four great elements of what if I...

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Space and consciousness.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Because if you look at it,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
there's a very little distinction between them.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Because even space, the negative,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
the absence of matter,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
serves as matter.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
And the consciousness is listed within because the consciousness is actually

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
in that sense external,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
with that matter.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
So you can't conceive...

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Well, you can conceive, sorry, you can conceive matter,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
which is more of a reality.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
But truly, you can't access the matter.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
But in the same sense,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
you can't access your own consciousness.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Because it's all your own consciousness.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
It's out there with those four great elements.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
How outside of your reach?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
So what are you going to have?

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
It's basically Nama Rupa.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
That's all that appears.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
No matter how remote, how big use,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
how distant, how abstract,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
it's still within the Nama Rupa.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
You can't have the experience of consciousness in itself,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
or matter in itself,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
or even have its conscious matter,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
i.e., the real experience of Nama Rupa.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
But both ends of that experience,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
i.e. consciousness and the matter

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
are external to you,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
in principle, inaccessible.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Which makes Nama Rupa inaccessible to you.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
You can just be witnessing it.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Well, suffering or account of it,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
or whatever else.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
But you can't access it either.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
In its nature,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
manifests,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
and for those reasons,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
it ceases.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Just because it manifests.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Just because it comes from the direction

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
that it's inaccessible to you.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
So, it would be like

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
you're wearing borrowed clothes,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
that's your idea where it came from,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
and your idea when it's going to be taken away from you.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
That's your life.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
That's everyone's life.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Entirely.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Because it's the thing,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
oh, well, like, you know,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I can still enjoy borrowed stuff.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
You could, if you were to know,

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
when the person is going to come and take it away.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Oh, I still have two months to go.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
But you don't.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
It can be, after the next in breath.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And that's it.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
And you realize, oh, okay,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I better adjust my plans accordingly.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
But no people adjust their plans accordingly,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
or what if you do.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
So, when things are taken away from you,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
they're always in the, like,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
in the stress.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
But if you were, there's nothing based on

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
if you don't plan,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
like to simplify it a bit.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
If you don't plan anything on a kind of borrowed things,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
and those things are taken away,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
you will remain completely unaffected.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So, basically, when death comes,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
you will be completely unaffected

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
if you don't plan anything on a kind of life.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Because life is a thing,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
that's borrowed.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Well, that's kind of in front of you,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
and then you decided to borrow it.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
But you have no idea who owns it

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
and who takes it away at what time.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And the Buddha did say something similar.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
He said,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Mara can do with people what he wants

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
because they come to his territory

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
and use his things.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
So, it's like a bait.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
On the kind of that, he's in charge of them.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
And then what are those things?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And you might think,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
oh, I'm awesome behavior.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
There is those things or something.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It's much more than that.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Those things are your eyes,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
your ears, your nose, your tongue,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
your whole sense base.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And it's kind of like that's all Mara.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
So, you realize,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
okay, so whatever appears in some line.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Oh, funny enough, we're going to say,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
whatever appears,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
and everything that you know of,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
everything that you think of,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
everything that you might see or hear

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
and think of,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
it will have that in common

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
that it will appear.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
And for that reason, it will not be yours

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
or other it cannot be yours.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Well, you might take it, sir.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Who says,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
everything becomes like a piece of wood.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Yes, it does.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Oh, yeah, when he has the monks in the forest.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Would you, like, well,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
some of you would probably be,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
how do you say?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Well, it was basically talking about the,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
you know, people being upset

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
on a kind of sickness or death,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
something happening to your body.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
And he said, he asked monks, would you be upset

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
if somebody comes in this woods now?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And starts collecting these dried up twigs

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
and branches that fell off the trees.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And I'm like, no, we wouldn't, of course.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
There's nothing to do with us.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That's how you should regard yourself

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
because it has nothing to do with you.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
But that also requires giving up the pleasures

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
that you gain through that body.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Which is why it's so intoxicating.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
And again, there's another suit, I was about to say it,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
but there is another suit that says it better.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
If this human will only be consisting of pain,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
people wouldn't need much of prompting

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
to go for liberation.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
But it doesn't.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
It consists of that pleasure as well.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Which is why people get intoxicated

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
and blinded in regard to that,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
which is hurting them.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
You just don't see it.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Because you're intoxicated with little pleasure

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
you get from it.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
But both.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
Or within the nature of the borrowed goods.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Did you know permission to borrow?

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
And you certainly know control how long you can use it.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
So basically, it's even worse.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And then you think you own it.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
So imagine your surprise.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And Mara does come and collect what he is.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Well, it always was he is.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
That's why they're not like all the other suitors

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
who often talk about their puppet on the strings.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
So all the things you borrow are basically the strings

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
that Mara uses then to pull you.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Because you hold onto those strings.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
So the puppet is going with the strings

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
that are yanking it.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
But also even that self.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
Even that person that holds onto things,

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
experience, or that self that is manifest.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
That must also be seen.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Same.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
You just see everything with the same right view.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
So even that sense of self.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
It's a reason.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
It's manifest.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
You can designate.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
It's real.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
So the Buddha never said there is no self.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
He said, well, basically, there is not self.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
So that which you take to be a self,

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
that sense of self, doesn't belong to you.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
Is that a stop being able to see your own view?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Both the right view.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
You have it.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
You have that wrong view.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And that sense of self is actually, well,

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
as the Buddha said,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
it can often be just a sense of an individual sense

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
of a particularly unique set of five aggregates.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
That you take to be like the most personal aspect

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
of your experience,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
so you take to be the yourself.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
But no matter what sense of self it is,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
how strong it is,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
leave it for what it is.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Don't try to deny it when you get it,

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
because there will be again,

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
denying the things that you can't even deny.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
They manifest on their own.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
So you're trying to cover up the contradiction in terms

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
that's where people end up being very frustrated.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
But the point is, no,

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
allow your sense of self,

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
actually see your sense of self as a phenomenon.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Like, basically,

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
these other words saying,

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
see your sense of self as manifested,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
because it is manifested.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
In very ambiguous terms,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
but it's still manifested as such.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
So see it like that,

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
and then don't regard it as belonging to you.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Yeah, because even your self,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
it's just, yeah.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, nothing,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
nothing in an experience you could have created.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Which means everything you can abandon everything.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
All of it can be abandoned.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's just the idea that something,

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
that something can create things

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
without being a thing itself.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
And then you feel like,

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
all you need to undo certain processes or whatever,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
in order for it to stop,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
and then you can really

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
abandon self as, no,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
that's already the act of yourself.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
You just have to see,

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
and that's why at any time,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
you can see the right view.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
No matter what situation,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
go to bed.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
If you look through the whole thing,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
including your sense of self,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
and not only.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Like, I recognize that you can't only

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
in your sense of self,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
which is why it's not yours.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
So there is not self.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
There is that which you take to be self,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
but it's not yourself.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Resultate,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
this sort of debt,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
so you just abandon it.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
When it continues about,

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
do you see this?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Well, yeah,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
it comes like to the very fundamental age.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Do you see this has manifested?

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Yes, when there was a,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
do you see it manifested

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
with this as a condition?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Yes, when there was a,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
do you see it with the disappearance

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
of that condition?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
What has come,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
what is manifested has come to cessation?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Like this deep domain standing.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
So you need to introduce that,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
like, a determination.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I do see this as a condition

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
of the manifested thing.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
While you're seeing the manifested thing,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
so it's not an explanation

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
of a linear causality.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Oh, this A creates B,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
and I'm watching both,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
thus I'm not myself.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Like, that's just complete magical thinking.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Will you project?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Well, all of the things are impermanent.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
They constantly change in the scientists,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
say the atoms, the atoms are molecules.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
They're never,

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
in one electrons,

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
they're never in the same spot,

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
etc.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
So,

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
I still suffer

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
when I kind of

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
fulfill these eyes,

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
and I kind of being paper people

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
and I'll be prepared,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
being separate from people

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
and I'll be separated from.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
No matter what scientific view

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
I might talk,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
it doesn't pertain to you.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
But,

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
if you see as all those things

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
as manifested,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
when I say manifested

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
by themselves on their own,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
it means determined by something

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
other than you.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Yet,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
like the entire manifestation

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
is completely out of your hands.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And if that's

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
the direction where they came from,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
that determination,

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
disappears,

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
they can't possibly stay,

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
which means

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
you're gone,

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
your experience is taken away.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
So, it says,

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
do you see it as determined by

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
something else?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Well, in this particular suit,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
that he uses the

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
element.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Do you see it as

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
neutralment?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And it's neutral

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
into something that you don't

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
necessarily see particularly.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
No, because there wouldn't be a

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
neutralment,

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
it would be another thing.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
That's now

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
neutral, but something else.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
So,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
that's why I say,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
while you're aware

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
of the manifesto thing,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
within that manifesto thing,

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
you can discern

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
its neutralment.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
But not by

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
looking away

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
from the manifesto thing,

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
and then,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
why?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Because then you will be

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
looking at another

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
manifested thing,

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
which you will think is

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
the neutralment

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
of the previous manifesto thing.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
So, see how you

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
kind of squeezed yourself out,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
and made this whole

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
relationship external.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
If it's external,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
it won't be the right view.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Needs to arise internally.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
So, needs to arise

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
within the manifested thing,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
the neutralment

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
would be then

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
the real neutralment

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
because you have an

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
abandoned manifesto thing.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
To me,

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
it's all about this.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
So, it's not

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
A

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
and B.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
It's

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
A

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
and smaller A.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Within

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
that A.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
So,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
the general experience,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
in particular,

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
things inside it?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Sure.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
But that's a very

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
general thing to put,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
to put it in a way,

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
it's just like,

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
two general.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Well, no,

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
when you say,

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
it's just general,

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
in particular,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
it's an explanation.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
No.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
It's an experience.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Well, again,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
general thing can become

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
particular if you

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
forget about it as

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
general,

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
and then you

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
rather experience it

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
more generally than you

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
got to it.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
And you still think

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
you think of general

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
thing.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Means,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
whatever is manifested,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
any of the

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
aggregates,

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
whatever is manifested.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Or you can just go

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
as we spoke before,

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
the presence of your body,

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
the presence of your mind,

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
two simultaneous things,

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
inseparable from it.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
But you can see,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
when you think about a

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
body, well,

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
that's a mental

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
image.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
You don't worry about it.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
So everything

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
shares the nature

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
of a mental

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
image.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
And what does it mean?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Everything is

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
manifested.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Because everything

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
manifests on the

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
level of a mental

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
image.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
So, why do you

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
have the mental

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
image of that certain

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
thing?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
You discern its

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
new treatment within

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
that.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
And discerning its

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
new treatment means

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
discerning it as

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
coming from something

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
other than

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
the presence of

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
self.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
That's what you

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
said.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Like, you need to see a

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
thing depending upon

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
something else that

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
cannot be yours.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
And then that

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
thing that is yours will

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
be disowned.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Because you just

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
actually, I can't

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
own this.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Because if that thing

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
that I cannot own

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
disappears, this thing

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
will not stand.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
So actually,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
that thing belongs

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
to the other.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
It belongs to

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
its new treatment.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
It cannot

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
belong to me.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Because I

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
have no say in its

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
appearance.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
I have no say in its

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
appearance.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
So this, yeah.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
This has appeared

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
because of that

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
because of which

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
has appeared.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Because

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
like, this

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
experience, this

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
mental experience, this

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
experience, this

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
experience of

33:34.000 --> 33:43.000
normal

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
root.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Its

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
new treatment is

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
well, we can

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
speak about it.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
We can say the

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
experience of

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
self.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
That I said

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
self is a

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
manifested phenomenon.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
That you

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
confused to, well, that

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
you conceived to belong

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
to you.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
But it's on the

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
earth.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
So you can take your

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
sense of self.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Then a bigger sense of

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
self.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
And it's manifested.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
So you need to discern

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
its manifestation

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
whether it through

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
increasing its presence,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
decreasing its presence,

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
or simply

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
persisting either way.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
So when you

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
become skilled in

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
like discerning

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
manifestation, picking

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
up the signs of

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
things.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
That's the picking of

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
the signs of your

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
mind.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Chitanivita.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Within that, then,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
when you think about,

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
okay, what is this

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
thing inseparable

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
from?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
What is a necessary

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
condition?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
What is a new

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
treatment?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
What is a basis for

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
these sense of self to

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
be here?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
But then you have to,

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
like, you only

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
summon a secret

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
root.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
The womb

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
attention means exactly

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
that.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Goes to the root of the

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
present thing.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Not to the root of

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
another thing.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Of another experience.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
So that's why you need

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
that proper attention to

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
discern within the

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
present manifestation to

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
discern its

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
conditions.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Or formations.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Or determinations.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Or

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
sancaro, whatever you

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
want to translate it.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
So with our

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
abandoning, the

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
manifest sense of

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
self that you're

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
mindful of.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
You need to discern

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
within that

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
what is that sense of

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
self inseparable

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
from?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
And then whatever you

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
find would

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
will most likely be a

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
determination that, I

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
think, unless you

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
over-intended, or rather

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
over-attended, that

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
manifestation in looking

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
for its

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
new treatment and then

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
found other things that

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
then became

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
manifestations.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
And they themselves

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
had their own

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
new treatments within

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
themselves that you

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
have not seen.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Because you have to

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
consider that

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
you have to consider

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
that you have to

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
consider that

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
you have to consider

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
that you have to

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
consider that

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
you have to consider

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
that you have to

35:49.000 --> 35:49.000
consider that

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
you have to consider

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
that you have to consider

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
that you have to consider

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
that you have to consider

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
that you have to consider

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
that you are

35:55.000 --> 35:55.800
mindful of

35:55.800 --> 35:57.000
its insignificant

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Yes.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.680
The

35:59.680 --> 36:07.080
my statement

36:07.080 --> 36:09.360
of this

36:09.360 --> 36:11.800
I was very

36:12.000 --> 36:14.440
sensing

36:14.440 --> 36:20.140
You know counting deep with the probe and then pulling this thing out everything else is the same

36:20.140 --> 36:22.720
Just that one big there one misunderstanding of the very good

36:23.440 --> 36:26.280
colors and sort of poses everything else

36:31.280 --> 36:33.280
Curious so back on the sense of self

36:34.280 --> 36:40.040
What is it? What is it inseparable from while that sense of self is present within that sense of self discern

36:41.240 --> 36:43.240
What is inseparable from

36:43.240 --> 36:49.200
Could you have sense of self present without being able to think

36:49.960 --> 36:54.720
Without having any mental images whatsoever would you be able to descend at the biggest sense of self and me?

36:56.920 --> 37:05.360
You wouldn't so would you be able to think if there is no living body that it's still operating and paid with conscious and so they are in the world

37:06.440 --> 37:08.440
You wouldn't

37:08.440 --> 37:12.440
So then is that living body paid because you wouldn't be able to think you wouldn't be able to have sense of self

37:12.440 --> 37:18.240
So then there wouldn't be a sense of self in that sense that would belong to you because if something would happen to that body

37:18.240 --> 37:22.560
If something would happen to that consciousness if something to happen to that ability to think

37:23.800 --> 37:27.880
That sense of self goes cannot possibly remain standing

37:27.880 --> 37:31.160
You see me while it's in there see you can see all that like on a board

37:31.160 --> 37:35.440
You can write it down as a chart and it will make good sense explanation

37:35.440 --> 37:38.680
But it will not be open I go and you certainly not

37:39.760 --> 37:46.520
Feel from suffering or bring you closer to it. Why because you're not seeing it in the right order and by the right order

37:46.520 --> 37:48.760
I mean you don't you're seeing it literally you don't see

37:49.480 --> 37:51.480
One within the other

37:52.360 --> 37:54.360
Not next to a while

37:54.680 --> 37:57.400
One while the other is still present

37:58.600 --> 38:01.720
So you're seeing it left and right or down

38:01.720 --> 38:04.680
But you're not seeing it within that thing

38:08.720 --> 38:10.720
You take the self

38:11.120 --> 38:17.640
That's where the whole the whole I'll be done in the commentaries. That's where the entire attitude the entire way of looking is completely wrong

38:19.440 --> 38:25.160
You all the stuff from the suitors are there rich and linear like packed in lists and stuff

38:25.360 --> 38:28.520
But it's all in there. It's all out there that you can observe

38:28.520 --> 38:35.960
That's why there's always a reason the order of things the Buddha would he wouldn't just list things out to you

38:35.960 --> 38:42.440
You'll be like well like this. Do you see this has come to be yes now that you see that this has come to be

38:42.640 --> 38:46.760
That sense of self I'm talking about right now that it's manifested that you see it for what it is

38:46.760 --> 38:49.680
Yeah, do you see it inseparable from certain nutrients?

38:50.440 --> 38:55.400
Like he would not be able to he would not be able to even be conceived without those nutrients present

38:55.400 --> 38:58.400
Yes, Lord, we see that

38:58.560 --> 39:02.320
So would you see that with the cessation of those nutrients?

39:02.320 --> 39:07.840
This will not remain standing even for a split second inconceivable like the two sticks holding each other

39:07.840 --> 39:09.840
You move on the other one goes down

39:10.040 --> 39:18.440
Yes, Lord, we see and then he refers to that because this this view is the purified and bright view as it is

39:18.680 --> 39:22.280
Basically, that's the right that just just that principle is the right view

39:22.280 --> 39:27.480
Nothing else and that's why they're like the kind of generic

39:27.480 --> 39:33.160
Thermal like so sort of party for the right views like, oh, whatever has the nature of rising has the nature of ceasing

39:33.360 --> 39:37.040
Whatever it's manifested will have to see basically because it's manifested

39:38.880 --> 39:43.200
And then he said even that view as pure as bright like

39:44.200 --> 39:46.040
Your band don't even that

39:46.040 --> 39:53.520
By using that view you abandon all the wrong views, and then you just let go even of that view and then the dharma is truly told as

39:53.920 --> 39:55.920
Like as a simile of the raft and so

40:00.880 --> 40:02.880
Yeah, so it's a

40:02.880 --> 40:07.120
Take a sense of self again. Why is this manifest good is

40:07.120 --> 40:19.800
Some of like you keep that in front yeah, but then you look at the whole the two sides at the same time

40:19.800 --> 40:24.000
But they start distinguishing the sides as within that front you're keeping

40:24.680 --> 40:30.120
Yeah, I can't explain. I know because it's not spatial. Yeah, it doesn't pretend to space

40:31.600 --> 40:34.040
But I know what you mean. I'm just saying to the same

40:34.040 --> 40:37.920
That's why it's so easy to confuse what comes first what comes second

40:39.280 --> 40:41.280
It's

40:41.280 --> 40:46.600
kind of the same on the same level, but there is first there is second depending on what you attend

40:48.680 --> 40:52.520
So as I said you can over attend and then start attending those

40:52.520 --> 41:01.280
Supposed in utriments of your sense of self as as separate senses of self as separate things that you just do to be yours

41:03.600 --> 41:06.040
But no, you want to have that thing in front of you

41:07.640 --> 41:09.160
Sense of self

41:09.160 --> 41:14.240
Within this very present sense of self you discern things

41:15.320 --> 41:21.480
Without abandoning so while you're mindful of the sense of self within that mindfulness of the sense of self

41:21.480 --> 41:26.360
You discern things that this sense of self isn't separable from as sense of self

41:29.160 --> 41:31.160
And

41:31.160 --> 41:34.640
Like see that there will be all over doing it. You can call it later

41:35.640 --> 41:41.400
That's why like in your set up. Well, like somebody might not necessarily use the 12 factored

41:42.000 --> 41:46.240
Explanation, but it's about because all they see is with this this is and that's it

41:46.240 --> 41:53.040
That's what I'm talking about with this this is so with these nutrients this is, but you see it in reverse order

41:54.240 --> 41:58.160
Then later you can start discerning more and more where you become proficient in that

41:58.840 --> 42:03.240
Principle as when they were under the ins and off. This is so easy. You've seen all the time. You said no

42:03.760 --> 42:09.280
Don't say that because like before for the very reason people don't see that which you find easy now

42:10.080 --> 42:12.400
They remain bound for some sort of for like

42:12.400 --> 42:15.680
Well, in total amounts of times

42:25.120 --> 42:28.480
Yeah, I can legal it my sense of self now

42:29.240 --> 42:31.560
What is it with the sense of self?

42:32.600 --> 42:34.600
What is this?

42:34.600 --> 42:42.880
You can simplify it, but as long as you do it right according to well as long as you do the principle right you can

42:42.880 --> 42:47.720
As simplified as you want in terms of designation you can just say with this this

42:48.760 --> 42:52.080
But in your mind see thing within I think

42:53.240 --> 42:57.200
Nothing next to the thing nothing before the thing nothing after the thing

42:57.680 --> 43:03.360
Think within the present thing and that's why it's a callica. It's time less

43:03.360 --> 43:09.520
Does not pertain to time because it's one within the other simultaneously present

43:12.840 --> 43:20.200
That's why I'm learning the pastor I remember using saying like when it feels like a thought a thought closes upon itself

43:20.880 --> 43:24.840
Because you don't go left. You don't go right. You don't go to another thought. You have a thought present

43:25.240 --> 43:27.240
Whatever shape of form and within that

43:28.320 --> 43:31.280
You sort of well, let it go in a sense

43:31.280 --> 43:38.080
Seat impossible to own like you you have no it like we notice you have no idea where it came from

43:38.080 --> 43:42.280
Which is the direction of its origin is just in Brazil. So you just have a thing arisen and

43:42.920 --> 43:46.360
For that very reason you recognize a thing will cease

43:46.360 --> 44:01.360
Does a swing is in public?
