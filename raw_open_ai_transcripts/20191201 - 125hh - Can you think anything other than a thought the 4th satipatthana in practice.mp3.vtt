00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
So what was the idea?

00:05.000 --> 00:21.300
Well, maybe I'll start with a question and see where it takes us.

00:21.300 --> 00:36.300
What is, how would you describe in its content, a thought?

00:36.300 --> 00:39.300
The images of...

00:39.300 --> 00:45.300
Of what?

00:45.300 --> 00:50.300
Of things that I've seen, or that I've perceived.

00:50.300 --> 00:54.300
And images of perception.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.300
Okay, so what is the... and perceptions?

00:57.300 --> 01:01.300
How do you then know perceptions?

01:01.300 --> 01:04.300
What is a perception in its content?

01:04.300 --> 01:06.300
In its content.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.300
Yeah.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.300
Or what you've seen, things that I've seen.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.300
In particular, types of science.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.300
So let's look at something.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.300
What do we have here?

01:16.300 --> 01:19.300
Take a measure.

01:19.300 --> 01:23.300
So you're looking at a tape measure.

01:23.300 --> 01:27.300
What is in its content, of your sight?

01:27.300 --> 01:29.300
The shape, the colour.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.300
The shape, the colour.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.300
What is the shape?

01:31.300 --> 01:33.300
Colour in the content.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.300
What is the shape, the designation?

01:35.300 --> 01:37.300
Shape, shape, colour, colour.

01:37.300 --> 01:43.300
What is that, in your mind?

01:43.300 --> 01:48.300
Well, in image, I suppose it's the closest thing I can...

01:48.300 --> 01:49.300
Sure?

01:49.300 --> 01:50.300
It's a...

01:50.300 --> 01:51.300
Yeah, that's fine.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.300
We can call it an image.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.300
So it's an image.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.300
So then, is your perception an image?

01:56.300 --> 01:58.300
An actual perception?

01:58.300 --> 02:01.300
Is this also an image?

02:01.300 --> 02:04.300
In your mind?

02:04.300 --> 02:06.300
Yeah.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.300
It's a different type.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.300
It's not as...

02:10.300 --> 02:11.300
What's the difference?

02:11.300 --> 02:13.300
What would you mean, different type?

02:13.300 --> 02:18.300
It would look like if I'm imagining a major tape.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.300
Sure, okay.

02:20.300 --> 02:24.300
And then when I'm seeing one, it's a different quality.

02:24.300 --> 02:35.300
But what is in common?

02:35.300 --> 02:38.300
What is in common to the sight of a tape measure?

02:38.300 --> 02:42.300
And now, to your thought of it.

02:42.300 --> 02:46.300
What is in common?

02:46.300 --> 02:49.300
The thought.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.300
Sure.

02:50.300 --> 02:56.300
But what is the content of the thought then?

02:56.300 --> 03:02.300
Like, because you have an abstract thought, a natural thought, theoretical, clear, ambiguous...

03:02.300 --> 03:04.300
Why do they all have in common?

03:04.300 --> 03:06.300
Why do all thoughts have in common?

03:06.300 --> 03:08.300
They have thoughts.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.300
But in terms of the content, why do they all have in common?

03:11.300 --> 03:15.300
What is the common characteristic of all the thoughts?

03:15.300 --> 03:20.300
Why do they all have?

03:20.300 --> 03:22.300
You said it.

03:22.300 --> 03:23.300
What are the images?

03:23.300 --> 03:26.300
They have an image.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.300
Literally, an image.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.300
So the thought and the image is different?

03:33.300 --> 03:38.300
Well, I'm trying to clarify it here

03:38.300 --> 03:43.300
in the sense that image is like specific.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.300
It's within a thought.

03:44.300 --> 03:49.300
So you can't have thoughts without images.

03:49.300 --> 03:54.300
But images are more precise thoughts, so to speak.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.300
So you can call them thoughts, dummies.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.300
You can call them phenomena.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.300
Images of content.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.300
But that's the thing.

04:02.300 --> 04:06.300
You don't start with a pure recognition of image as a content.

04:06.300 --> 04:13.300
You start with heavy concepts of abstract thoughts, ideas, designations.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.300
So you need to make the effort through those ideas and designations

04:17.300 --> 04:20.300
to discern a certain enduring container of an image,

04:20.300 --> 04:24.300
which is what gives the identity to a thought as a thought.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.300
So that's what I mean.

04:25.300 --> 04:29.300
Thought is a more broader application of the term,

04:29.300 --> 04:33.300
but more specifically images.

04:33.300 --> 04:37.300
So can you say something has manifested?

04:37.300 --> 04:39.300
Yeah, those are the characteristics of images.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.300
Exactly, that's what I was going to say.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.300
I can only know that because there's some image there.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.300
Exactly.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.300
So that's what I'm saying.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.300
In the same sense, in the previous talk,

04:48.300 --> 04:52.300
we spoke about the resisting aspect of your thought.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.300
That's what images are,

04:54.300 --> 04:58.300
because you have no say in how things appear to you,

04:58.300 --> 05:00.300
in how it manifested.

05:00.300 --> 05:05.300
Yet that is an image upon which you can think further and further and further.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.300
So yeah, you said correctly,

05:08.300 --> 05:12.300
in a way there is a difference between you imagining your images

05:12.300 --> 05:14.300
and you perceiving,

05:14.300 --> 05:17.300
but there is also the common ground to it.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.300
And that common ground is not an external relation.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.300
That common ground is a necessary container for both.

05:22.300 --> 05:26.300
You wouldn't be able to think this particular day measuring if you've never seen it.

05:26.300 --> 05:31.300
And you've never seen it if you've never had an image in mind of it.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.300
That's why you can sometimes not see it,

05:34.300 --> 05:36.300
but I can describe it to you,

05:36.300 --> 05:40.300
and then you can see it and recognize it as the same thing,

05:40.300 --> 05:44.300
because it's the same basis of the same images.

05:44.300 --> 05:49.300
And any difference in my description and what you saw,

05:49.300 --> 05:53.300
if the difference is not sufficient for you to doubt the identity of the thing,

05:53.300 --> 05:56.300
or if you don't realize, oh no, that's the thing he was talking about.

05:56.300 --> 05:58.300
Now I understand it correctly now.

05:58.300 --> 06:04.300
So perceptions and imagination are mental images.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.300
So whether you perceive,

06:06.300 --> 06:10.300
whether you imagine images are there.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.300
So in other words,

06:12.300 --> 06:18.300
perception is basically images of the senses,

06:18.300 --> 06:24.300
and imagination is images upon the images.

06:24.300 --> 06:28.300
But you wouldn't say that an image represents what an image represents?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.300
No, absolutely not.

06:30.300 --> 06:34.300
Because that assumes that you can even conceive rightly

06:34.300 --> 06:38.300
that from which my perception came about.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.300
And how can you know that unless you're perceiving it?

06:41.300 --> 06:47.300
Which means how can you perceive what comes before perception?

06:47.300 --> 06:49.300
So this is before my perception.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.300
That's an assumption.

06:51.300 --> 06:54.300
That's an assumption of the external world.

06:54.300 --> 06:58.300
That's how you allow the footing for the matter.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.300
Because it's because of the matter that you perceive.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.300
But see when you're thinking, oh, that's the real matter?

07:03.300 --> 07:05.300
No, you can only perceive it,

07:05.300 --> 07:07.300
which means you can only perceive your perception,

07:07.300 --> 07:10.300
and then you get to assume the matter behind.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.300
So would you say a feeling is an image?

07:14.300 --> 07:17.300
Yes, everything, the manifest is an image,

07:17.300 --> 07:19.300
on the level of manifestation.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.300
And that's why I wanted to use the word image,

07:21.300 --> 07:23.300
not the word thought,

07:23.300 --> 07:24.300
because then people say,

07:24.300 --> 07:26.300
ah, so only when I think it, it's real?

07:26.300 --> 07:27.300
No.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.300
You can only think something if the images are there.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.300
And you don't have to think it.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.300
You can just look at it.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.300
And that's the common ground

07:36.300 --> 07:38.300
that probably many people would struggle to find

07:38.300 --> 07:43.300
between senses, as in the physical and the mental.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.300
Because it's usually the senses,

07:45.300 --> 07:48.300
and now I'm in my thoughts as a result of it.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.300
No.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.300
Whether my thoughts, images are there,

07:52.300 --> 07:54.300
perceptual images are there,

07:54.300 --> 07:56.300
that's why it's on the level of perception,

07:56.300 --> 07:58.300
images as well.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.300
So say somebody,

08:00.300 --> 08:05.300
not mindful that they're kind of,

08:05.300 --> 08:07.300
not really thinking about what they're doing,

08:07.300 --> 08:08.300
but they're doing something,

08:08.300 --> 08:10.300
aiming at towards something.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.300
So that thing that they're aiming at,

08:12.300 --> 08:14.300
they're actually aware of what it is they're aiming at.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.300
But it's still present as an image.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.300
Yeah.

08:17.300 --> 08:20.300
It's just not something that they're actually going on.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.300
That's the thing that I'm...

08:22.300 --> 08:23.300
Yeah, exactly.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.300
I don't know what I want.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.300
That's the images you're having in mind.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.300
Yeah.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.300
You have a vague, ambiguous direction.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.300
I don't know what I want,

08:31.300 --> 08:34.300
but clearly you're doing something about it in some way,

08:34.300 --> 08:36.300
which means you have some sense.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.300
So whatever, a sense, a thought,

08:38.300 --> 08:41.300
ambiguous idea, abstract theory,

08:41.300 --> 08:44.300
actual perception of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch,

08:44.300 --> 08:46.300
images are there.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.300
Because literally,

08:51.300 --> 08:54.300
Dhamma could be translated as an image,

08:54.300 --> 08:56.300
a phenomenon, an image,

08:56.300 --> 08:59.300
a thing, yeah.

09:03.300 --> 09:08.300
So, would you say

09:08.300 --> 09:14.300
the image is also, like,

09:14.300 --> 09:18.300
what's designated, the designation

09:18.300 --> 09:22.300
of whatever it is that's manifested.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.300
So something's there,

09:23.300 --> 09:26.300
it's designated in some way, that's the image.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.300
That's already the beginning of your designation, sure.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.300
Yeah.

09:30.300 --> 09:42.300
Okay.

09:42.300 --> 09:48.300
Can you have an image without a color of it?

09:48.300 --> 09:49.300
No.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.300
Exactly.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.300
So that's why the Buddha described perception

09:52.300 --> 09:54.300
in its fundamental terms.

09:54.300 --> 09:57.300
He perceives yellow, white, blue,

09:57.300 --> 10:00.300
white, red.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.300
That's it.

10:01.300 --> 10:05.300
But you can have an image without flavor,

10:05.300 --> 10:08.300
sound, smell.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.300
Sure, you can.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.300
But you can't have an image without a color,

10:13.300 --> 10:15.300
without space.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.300
Without space, exactly.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.300
That's why you can use space practically

10:18.300 --> 10:19.300
to summon the senses.

10:19.300 --> 10:24.300
You can have an image without a touch.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.300
Yeah, I suppose.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.300
It's like, there's not much you can designate,

10:29.300 --> 10:32.300
not much difference in designate between the touch.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.300
Your first point of touch is the first point of resistance,

10:35.300 --> 10:37.300
which is this body as a whole.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.300
So the image will then stand for that,

10:39.300 --> 10:42.300
but it's not what you can describe about that.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.300
But if you want to describe the characteristic of an image,

10:45.300 --> 10:48.300
yeah, it has to be color, it has to be shape,

10:48.300 --> 10:50.300
which means it has to have space,

10:50.300 --> 10:52.300
it has to be off-space.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.300
It has to be sound.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.300
Not really.

10:56.300 --> 11:01.300
So if I have an image of a taste,

11:01.300 --> 11:03.300
I have the image of a taste,

11:03.300 --> 11:05.300
the experience of a taste,

11:05.300 --> 11:07.300
there's something salty.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.300
Yeah, can you imagine?

11:09.300 --> 11:12.300
Saltyness without color.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.300
Yeah, you can.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.300
Can you imagine color without saltiness?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.300
You can.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.300
Because the senses also, they're not linear.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.300
The whole arrangement,

11:21.300 --> 11:24.300
the material arrangement of the sense organs,

11:24.300 --> 11:27.300
is such.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.300
It has its own arrangement.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.300
They're not all on the same field, so to speak,

11:33.300 --> 11:37.300
on the same level ground.

11:37.300 --> 11:41.300
So, but can you also, can you even,

11:41.300 --> 11:48.300
can you imagine saltiness

11:48.300 --> 11:50.300
without tasting it?

11:50.300 --> 11:53.300
Like you can have, you can have the idea of saltiness,

11:53.300 --> 11:55.300
but it's already quite secondary.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.300
But you can imagine blue,

11:58.300 --> 12:01.300
and it will go all the way to the point of the image,

12:01.300 --> 12:02.300
whatever.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.300
You can imagine yellow.

12:04.300 --> 12:07.300
Literally, you have an image of yellow in your mind.

12:07.300 --> 12:10.300
But saltiness, without tasting,

12:10.300 --> 12:12.300
you're not tasting it in your mouth.

12:12.300 --> 12:15.300
You can be hoping to taste it,

12:15.300 --> 12:23.300
but it's going to be more on the level of a secondary concept.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.300
Because you'll be really, when you imagine saltiness,

12:26.300 --> 12:29.300
you're imagining yourself eating some salty food,

12:29.300 --> 12:32.300
which is more like images of colors and shapes

12:32.300 --> 12:34.300
that you're consuming.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.300
They then get to taste like this.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.300
You're going to say salt is in white.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.300
Sure.

12:39.300 --> 12:44.300
So the perception of salt is experienced through the eye.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.300
Well, that's why the kind of,

12:46.300 --> 12:47.300
the obsession is, sorry,

12:47.300 --> 12:53.300
the perception of the image of tastes.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.300
The image of tastes.

12:54.300 --> 12:55.300
The image of tastes.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.300
So not the perception of tastes.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.300
In a way, yes.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.300
Not specifically through the eye,

12:59.300 --> 13:01.300
but you could say through the mental eye.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.300
There has to be an image there.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.300
Even if you were like blind your whole life,

13:05.300 --> 13:08.300
you will have to have an image of your experience

13:08.300 --> 13:11.300
as a whole of consuming some object in your mouth

13:11.300 --> 13:14.300
as producing the salty taste for you.

13:14.300 --> 13:20.300
But you can't imagine the pure saltiness in itself.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.300
But that's beside the point now,

13:22.300 --> 13:24.300
how these particular senses, which comes first,

13:24.300 --> 13:25.300
doesn't matter.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.300
Whichever way they come,

13:26.300 --> 13:28.300
an image has to be there.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.300
And if people were confused

13:29.300 --> 13:31.300
why would you be describing the perception

13:31.300 --> 13:33.300
in terms of colors, these images,

13:33.300 --> 13:36.300
it's because, yeah, that's what it would boil down to.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.300
And you can describe it also in terms of space.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.300
That's where space is sometimes listed

13:40.300 --> 13:42.300
as one of the elements.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.300
It's not a fundamental element,

13:43.300 --> 13:45.300
like four Mahabutas,

13:45.300 --> 13:48.300
but it's out there with consciousness

13:48.300 --> 13:50.300
and other Mahabutas,

13:50.300 --> 13:58.300
so like the six elements.

13:58.300 --> 14:04.300
So you said, why everything,

14:04.300 --> 14:07.300
every image has a color?

14:07.300 --> 14:11.300
First, every image is.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.300
Because now when you think every image has a color,

14:13.300 --> 14:16.300
they're saying color, it's another image for you.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.300
So what you're really saying is

14:17.300 --> 14:20.300
every image has an image.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.300
And that's true,

14:21.300 --> 14:23.300
but that's not practically accurate.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.300
So there is an image

14:25.300 --> 14:27.300
within which you discern the properties of color,

14:27.300 --> 14:36.300
characteristics of it being manifested.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.300
So think space.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.300
When I say space,

14:40.300 --> 14:45.300
what image is present in your mind?

14:45.300 --> 14:47.300
Space, space.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.300
What's present in your mind?

14:49.300 --> 14:51.300
Well, something clear.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.300
Something clear.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.300
When I say space,

14:53.300 --> 14:55.300
what's present in my mind is the word space,

14:55.300 --> 14:56.300
literally.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.300
OK.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.300
Written word space is what's present in my mind.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.300
But yeah, whatever.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.300
I was thinking expansive, sort of.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.300
The point is there has to be an image.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.300
There has to be an image.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.300
There has to be an image.

15:07.300 --> 15:12.300
If I say, I don't know,

15:12.300 --> 15:14.300
a term in another language

15:14.300 --> 15:16.300
that you don't understand,

15:16.300 --> 15:19.300
you still have to have an image in your mind

15:19.300 --> 15:21.300
on the basis of sound

15:21.300 --> 15:23.300
that I just produced at you.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.300
You will have an image of

15:25.300 --> 15:27.300
what does that mean?

15:27.300 --> 15:30.300
Is this gibberish or this particular language

15:30.300 --> 15:33.300
or you will have to have some image always.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.300
There is no such thing as an imageless mind,

15:36.300 --> 15:39.300
unless neither perception or perception and so on.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.300
OK.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.300
Even space, basis of infinite space

15:42.300 --> 15:44.300
is basis of infinite image.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.300
Yeah.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.300
Image of infiniteness of space.

15:47.300 --> 15:50.300
But both narrowly, even if you're not,

15:50.300 --> 15:52.300
there's something's gone.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.300
There's an image.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.300
Within that image,

15:54.300 --> 15:56.300
you will discern various perceptions.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.300
Well, within that image,

15:57.300 --> 15:59.300
you'll discern the five senses.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.300
Within that image,

16:00.300 --> 16:02.300
you'll discern more images.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.300
Within that image,

16:03.300 --> 16:05.300
you'll discern your intentions.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.300
Yeah.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.300
So there's a kind of

16:10.300 --> 16:12.300
a sort of starting image,

16:12.300 --> 16:14.300
which is basically the image of this experience.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.300
Yeah.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.300
And the starting image does not disappear

16:17.300 --> 16:18.300
when the second thing comes in.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.300
The starting image remains as a primary soul,

16:21.300 --> 16:23.300
only container in which

16:23.300 --> 16:25.300
you can't be outside of it.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.300
That's where the mind comes first.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.300
The image comes first.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.300
So primary image.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.300
You're thinking there's a side of this image

16:32.300 --> 16:33.300
that isn't yours?

16:33.300 --> 16:34.300
There's another image.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.300
Within this image.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.300
That image is what experiences are.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.300
Sorry?

16:38.300 --> 16:39.300
Experience as a whole.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.300
Yeah.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.300
Of course.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.300
That's what the image looks like.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.300
Experience as a whole.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.300
When I say,

16:44.300 --> 16:47.300
imagine your experience as a whole.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.300
Or don't imagine your experience as a whole.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.300
Come back to the body.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.300
Be here now.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.300
Present.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.300
Be present moment.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.300
What is present with you

16:56.300 --> 16:58.300
in the most acute sense?

16:58.300 --> 17:01.300
You are not specifically looking, looking well.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.300
I might be doing,

17:02.300 --> 17:04.300
if I'm doing some sort of meditation technique,

17:04.300 --> 17:07.300
but if I'm not falling into that trap,

17:07.300 --> 17:10.300
and so you just want to be present,

17:10.300 --> 17:13.300
what is the closest thing to you?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.300
It's an image of this experience.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.300
That is a whole thing.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.300
This experience.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.300
So that's the point.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.300
You can't really have anything other than that,

17:22.300 --> 17:23.300
even if you want to.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.300
But the problem is when you have images,

17:25.300 --> 17:26.300
yet here you are,

17:26.300 --> 17:29.300
thinking you're observing the actual form.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.300
You think you're observing the matter,

17:30.300 --> 17:31.300
the reality behind.

17:31.300 --> 17:35.300
You think you're observing physical sensations and whatnot.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.300
All you're observing is images enduring,

17:38.300 --> 17:39.300
on account of which you end up

17:39.300 --> 17:42.300
misconceiving those images as matter,

17:42.300 --> 17:45.300
misconceiving those images as feelings,

17:45.300 --> 17:47.300
as perceptions, as intentions,

17:47.300 --> 17:48.300
as basically,

17:48.300 --> 17:50.300
misconceiving the aggregates.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.300
Or rather, conceiving the aggregates,

17:52.300 --> 17:53.300
giving them the being,

17:53.300 --> 17:58.300
assuming them, appropriating them.

17:58.300 --> 18:03.300
Think about me, myself.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.300
Can you even think that without an image?

18:06.300 --> 18:07.300
A certain degree,

18:07.300 --> 18:11.300
a certain independence of that aspect,

18:11.300 --> 18:12.300
of that thought I am.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.300
There's a certain shape to it,

18:15.300 --> 18:19.300
but usually gets associated with your own face.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.300
It's like veiled in the background,

18:22.300 --> 18:24.300
but the point is an image is there.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.300
It doesn't matter how ambiguous,

18:25.300 --> 18:26.300
how subtle,

18:26.300 --> 18:28.300
image has to be there.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.300
And not being trained in regard to those images

18:30.300 --> 18:33.300
means not being trained in regard to your mind.

18:33.300 --> 18:37.300
And that's how you will always then be governed

18:37.300 --> 18:39.300
by the kind of these assumed directions

18:39.300 --> 18:41.300
that these images take you.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.300
Image of my face means me, I am,

18:43.300 --> 18:46.300
my control, master, owner,

18:46.300 --> 18:48.300
appropriator, all that's implied.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.300
Not seeing it, you took it upon yourself.

18:51.300 --> 18:56.300
So leave your mind blank.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.300
What is that?

18:59.300 --> 19:02.300
You can.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.300
What is that?

19:03.300 --> 19:04.300
It's another image.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.300
So yeah, it's not truly blank.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.300
Because, well,

19:09.300 --> 19:11.300
how can you even designate blankness

19:11.300 --> 19:13.300
unless it's absence of something else,

19:13.300 --> 19:15.300
which is then an image present in your mind

19:15.300 --> 19:16.300
in regard to this,

19:16.300 --> 19:20.300
which is absence of that image?

19:20.300 --> 19:22.300
Think about the empty room.

19:22.300 --> 19:25.300
Yeah, well, yeah.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.300
So see, that's the whole,

19:27.300 --> 19:29.300
the sign of emptiness

19:29.300 --> 19:32.300
that the Buddha was talking about.

19:32.300 --> 19:36.300
Imagine when you go into the empty hut

19:36.300 --> 19:38.300
and you realize this place

19:38.300 --> 19:41.300
is empty of other people.

19:41.300 --> 19:44.300
So it's actually factually perceiving an image

19:44.300 --> 19:47.300
of absence of others.

19:47.300 --> 19:50.300
Fully develop that image and then apply to yourself.

19:50.300 --> 19:53.300
Oh, so so is this experience as a whole

19:53.300 --> 19:55.300
in its entirety.

19:55.300 --> 20:00.300
This image is absent of persons.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.300
That's it.

20:01.300 --> 20:06.300
Because you clarified the sign of emptiness,

20:06.300 --> 20:07.300
the characteristics of emptiness,

20:07.300 --> 20:09.300
means you see there's a clear image.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.300
Now you see it also pertaining

20:11.300 --> 20:13.300
to your own experience as a whole.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.300
It's not empty, empty, just space out

20:15.300 --> 20:18.300
and joules sort of us out unconscious.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.300
No, it's empty of this.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.300
This experience is empty of lust.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.300
It's empty of aversion.

20:23.300 --> 20:28.300
It's empty of delusion.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.300
So if I say emptiness,

20:30.300 --> 20:34.300
what's present in mind?

20:34.300 --> 20:38.300
Emptiness.

20:38.300 --> 20:41.300
What image is there?

20:41.300 --> 20:43.300
Well, nothingness.

20:43.300 --> 20:47.300
Okay, so what are the characteristics of nothingness?

20:47.300 --> 20:49.300
Empty.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.300
What is the characteristic of empty space?

20:51.300 --> 20:53.300
So then the space is there.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.300
So there is a certain container,

20:55.300 --> 20:57.300
but it's empty.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.300
So things that...

20:59.300 --> 21:01.300
Things could be in there.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.300
Yeah, but the point is,

21:03.300 --> 21:06.300
so things that are making the space empty

21:06.300 --> 21:10.300
are there as absence,

21:10.300 --> 21:13.300
as a negative presence.

21:13.300 --> 21:16.300
Because if there is nothing that could be in there,

21:16.300 --> 21:18.300
you wouldn't say this is empty or so.

21:18.300 --> 21:22.300
It would just be this is so.

21:22.300 --> 21:28.300
So the nothingness of what then?

21:28.300 --> 21:30.300
Nothingness.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.300
When I ask you emptiness,

21:32.300 --> 21:33.300
what do you say?

21:33.300 --> 21:34.300
Oh, nothingness.

21:34.300 --> 21:37.300
I say, well, what is the characteristic of nothingness?

21:37.300 --> 21:39.300
Okay, characteristic is empty space.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.300
Empty of what?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.300
That space? Empty of what?

21:42.300 --> 21:44.300
What is the absence in that space,

21:44.300 --> 21:46.300
in that nothingness?

21:46.300 --> 21:48.300
That comes to your mind when I keep repeating

21:48.300 --> 21:52.300
nothingness, nothingness, nothingness, nothingness.

21:52.300 --> 21:55.300
Well, there's not this...

21:55.300 --> 21:57.300
the absence of something.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.300
Absence of something, well,

21:59.300 --> 22:01.300
but that's already something, isn't it?

22:01.300 --> 22:02.300
Nothingness.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.300
What I said is something.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.300
So you can't say it's absence of something,

22:06.300 --> 22:09.300
because then it's not absence of itself.

22:09.300 --> 22:13.300
So more specifically, nothingness,

22:13.300 --> 22:17.300
or emptiness, more accurately.

22:17.300 --> 22:22.300
Empty of what?

22:22.300 --> 22:25.300
Empty of everything else that's not there.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.300
What are the characteristics of being empty?

22:28.300 --> 22:29.300
Don't necessarily look for the...

22:29.300 --> 22:31.300
It's empty of this, of this, of this.

22:31.300 --> 22:35.300
Characteristics of being empty.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.300
Can we just describe it?

22:36.300 --> 22:38.300
It has to be kind of negative.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.300
Exactly.

22:39.300 --> 22:46.300
Negative presence, or presence of absence.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.300
So it's well on the presence of absence.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.300
Really empty.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.300
It's not really empty, as in it's not really empty,

22:52.300 --> 22:55.300
and you assume the external world of real absence of things,

22:55.300 --> 22:57.300
which is inconceivable.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.300
It's not really empty.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.300
You can't even finish that sentence

23:00.300 --> 23:02.300
if things were truly empty,

23:02.300 --> 23:04.300
as in don't exist.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.300
Emptiness is not non-existence.

23:07.300 --> 23:09.300
It's only emptiness of certain things.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.300
But people are used to, well,

23:11.300 --> 23:13.300
not seeing the images in their mind,

23:13.300 --> 23:15.300
and then just following the kind of

23:15.300 --> 23:19.300
the positive directions of craving, pretty much.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.300
You say something like it's a pure image.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.300
Let's finish with this.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.300
Okay.

23:24.300 --> 23:26.300
So the point is emptiness.

23:26.300 --> 23:28.300
It's an image in your mind.

23:28.300 --> 23:29.300
Like you can even say,

23:29.300 --> 23:31.300
when I say emptiness, I just have a word emptiness

23:31.300 --> 23:33.300
written in my mind, big E.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.300
Okay.

23:34.300 --> 23:36.300
So what are the characteristics of something being empty?

23:36.300 --> 23:38.300
You said, well, it's an empty space.

23:38.300 --> 23:39.300
Okay.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.300
Empty space is defined as an empty space

23:42.300 --> 23:45.300
by absence of that which is empty of.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.300
That is its characteristic.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.300
That's what definition of emptiness is.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.300
Doesn't matter what is empty of.

23:51.300 --> 23:55.300
So it's a negative presence,

23:55.300 --> 23:59.300
or presence of the absence of certain things.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.300
Dwell on that image.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.300
Presence of absence, basically.

24:03.300 --> 24:06.300
It's not a contradiction because absence...

24:06.300 --> 24:07.300
Is a thing.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.300
Is a thing that is present.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.300
So it's the content of that that's not there,

24:12.300 --> 24:16.300
but the nature of absence is there.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.300
What else does it matter?

24:18.300 --> 24:24.300
The same principle in your experience then.

24:24.300 --> 24:34.300
Yes, sense of ownership, sense of master controller,

24:34.300 --> 24:37.300
because I am here, where?

24:37.300 --> 24:40.300
What is the content of my sense of self?

24:40.300 --> 24:42.300
Can you find it?

24:42.300 --> 24:45.300
Can you find the content of what you are?

24:45.300 --> 24:46.300
But you are.

24:46.300 --> 24:47.300
It's always a negative.

24:47.300 --> 24:50.300
So the absence of content is your presence.

24:50.300 --> 24:54.300
And that's why sense of self is assumed in regard to everything and nothing.

24:54.300 --> 24:55.300
But once you study...

24:55.300 --> 24:57.300
Oh, so the absence...

24:57.300 --> 25:01.300
Sorry, the presence of the absence is a real image.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.300
I don't need to keep chasing content

25:03.300 --> 25:06.300
and only to verify the image through finding the content.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.300
No, it's other way around.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.300
So by understanding the nature of emptiness

25:11.300 --> 25:13.300
you get to understand the nature of anata.

25:13.300 --> 25:17.300
And that's why this room is empty of others.

25:17.300 --> 25:22.300
And his mind is established upon the perception of that image.

25:22.300 --> 25:25.300
So is this body, these five aggregates,

25:25.300 --> 25:29.300
are empty of the self as in the self master controller.

25:29.300 --> 25:30.300
Empty.

25:30.300 --> 25:35.300
So there is the sense of self that is the presence, absence of the owner.

25:35.300 --> 25:39.300
Absence of the owner means non-ownership.

25:39.300 --> 25:44.300
Doesn't mean there was never ever presence of the absent owner.

25:44.300 --> 25:47.300
Sense of self is absent owner.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.300
Not seeing it as an absent owner,

25:49.300 --> 25:55.300
well, you get to then appropriate everything that you assume that self owns.

25:55.300 --> 26:00.300
But you realize that self can only be the absence of the actual owner,

26:00.300 --> 26:05.300
then yourself becomes not self, automatically.

26:05.300 --> 26:11.300
So back onto the images then.

26:11.300 --> 26:14.300
It's important to emphasize

26:14.300 --> 26:19.300
your seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching

26:19.300 --> 26:27.300
would not be so unless it's already an image in itself.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.300
Also, it's all in my mind then.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.300
It's all in my thought.

26:30.300 --> 26:33.300
That's an image that has a reason for it.

26:33.300 --> 26:37.300
So images are neither in your head nor in the things.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.300
It's just there in the middle.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.300
Something is there.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.300
Something is there.

26:40.300 --> 26:44.300
Images are that manifestation, that arising that Buddha talks about.

26:44.300 --> 26:46.300
That's what images are.

26:46.300 --> 26:51.300
Within that you can discern now the direction, the content of the sense objects

26:51.300 --> 26:54.300
or the absence of sense objects.

26:54.300 --> 26:58.300
You can discern the content of further images in your mind

26:58.300 --> 27:04.300
as in your own abstract thinking and so on.

27:04.300 --> 27:09.300
And the crucial characteristic of these images is that

27:09.300 --> 27:10.300
you don't create them.

27:10.300 --> 27:11.300
No.

27:11.300 --> 27:12.300
That's what I mean.

27:12.300 --> 27:16.300
Based on the previous talk we've done about the aspect of resistance

27:16.300 --> 27:19.300
in your thoughts, that's what images are.

27:19.300 --> 27:23.300
That which resists already has some shape, already has some form.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.300
So to speak, you wouldn't recognize if it wasn't.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.300
Absolutely.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.300
In some way, there was an image there.

27:29.300 --> 27:30.300
Yeah, exactly.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.300
It would not be known.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.300
Resistance is already an image.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.300
Yeah, exactly.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.300
You cannot think of resistance and then the image resists.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.300
No, resistance is an image.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.300
Resistance is already a designation.

27:41.300 --> 27:42.300
But there can't be an image.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.300
Designation already resists.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.300
Without resistance.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.300
Exactly.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.300
Either way, an image needs to be there.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.300
So they're all equal footing those two.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.300
They're not like one.

27:51.300 --> 27:54.300
And you could see how it could perhaps make more sense then.

27:54.300 --> 28:00.300
You could see how it could establish your mind upon the basis of infinite space.

28:00.300 --> 28:07.300
The image of infinity, the actual resisting aspect of the thought of infinity, that is

28:07.300 --> 28:09.300
what infinity is.

28:09.300 --> 28:10.300
Fully understand it.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.300
Fully invest effort in it.

28:12.300 --> 28:16.300
As we said, fully develop theme of it.

28:16.300 --> 28:20.300
As it fully discern the science of infinity, infinite space.

28:20.300 --> 28:25.300
And then you'll be dwelling and abiding in it.

28:25.300 --> 28:31.300
Whether you're walking, sitting, eating, lying down, going to toilet, your mind will be within

28:31.300 --> 28:35.300
that container of infinity.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.300
Meaning that you're including all...

28:38.300 --> 28:43.300
Meaning that whatever comes to that will be inferior to it, as the Buddha would describe

28:43.300 --> 28:44.300
it.

28:44.300 --> 28:49.300
Being inferior to it, if you find it completely dispassionate about it, includes all resistance.

28:49.300 --> 28:54.300
An image that includes all the other images you're used to.

28:54.300 --> 29:00.300
Yeah.

29:00.300 --> 29:04.300
So people usually swing between the two, like, I'm looking or I'm thinking.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.300
I can't see anything in between.

29:06.300 --> 29:09.300
So when you talk about images, these are thoughts.

29:09.300 --> 29:13.300
But now this is the reality of my senses.

29:13.300 --> 29:15.300
So you don't have to be excluding either.

29:15.300 --> 29:17.300
You want to see what's in common to both.

29:17.300 --> 29:23.300
When I have the experience of an image, when I have the experience of a sight, sound, smell, taste, touch.

29:23.300 --> 29:30.300
The experience is, there's an image there that isn't present in, presently enduring on its own.

29:30.300 --> 29:36.300
I just think it's like the whole philosophical tradition has been swinging.

29:36.300 --> 29:41.300
Swinging between the empiricists who were saying the senses come first and then the rationalists

29:41.300 --> 29:44.300
who were saying, no, no, no, the thoughts come first.

29:44.300 --> 29:48.300
Senses and thoughts are only known because they're an image.

29:48.300 --> 29:49.300
Yeah.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.300
They appear as an image.

29:50.300 --> 29:57.300
You're never seeing the middle ground, the middle way.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.300
Practice of casinos is practice of images.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.300
Yeah.

30:02.300 --> 30:10.300
As in, the greater images than the images that you kind of encounter in your average experience.

30:10.300 --> 30:17.300
That's why casinos of four elements, colours, space and consciousness.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.300
There's not focusing on a desk.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.300
That means focusing on what you're looking at.

30:21.300 --> 30:25.300
If you're not actually seeing it, you can only look at something because it's already an image.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.300
Because it's already known as an image.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.300
It's already appeared as an image.

30:28.300 --> 30:30.300
It's already enduring as an image.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.300
So it's more about discerning more.

30:32.300 --> 30:37.300
That's why, like, was it the Sariput or who was it?

30:37.300 --> 30:38.300
The block of wood.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.300
The block of wood.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.300
Mahamogalana.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.300
Discerning it as different.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.300
Yeah.

30:43.300 --> 30:47.300
As air, as basis of air, basis of water, basis of fire.

30:47.300 --> 30:48.300
Attractive.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.300
Attractive, ugly.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.300
The same thing.

30:50.300 --> 30:51.300
Yeah.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.300
Because it is.

30:52.300 --> 30:53.300
Yeah.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.300
It's the block of wood.

30:54.300 --> 31:03.300
It's so far down that if you look at the more general nature of what images it pertains to,

31:03.300 --> 31:04.300
it has solidity.

31:04.300 --> 31:08.300
The image of solidity is there.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
The image of heat is there.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.300
And the image of beauty is there.

31:12.300 --> 31:20.300
And it's rather that, so the image of solidity is that sort of higher ground where you can

31:20.300 --> 31:21.300
see the block of wood.

31:21.300 --> 31:22.300
Yeah.

31:22.300 --> 31:25.500
It's within the experience of seeing the block of wood, but you see the higher ground as

31:25.500 --> 31:29.900
coming first structurally, not the block of wood you're staring at.

31:29.900 --> 31:34.300
And that's why the Buddha said, like, when you develop the casinas, like, his mind gets,

31:34.300 --> 31:39.420
like he said, the Manprese then, I don't know, the casino of earth, the mind develops upon

31:39.420 --> 31:45.580
the image of earth, image of solid, and that's literally in everything you can ever perceive

31:45.580 --> 31:50.620
has a degree of solid, which means it pertains to the element of earth.

31:50.620 --> 31:52.140
It's within that.

31:52.140 --> 31:57.500
His mind develops upon that, he then develops dispassion, understanding, and escape in regard

31:57.500 --> 32:00.700
to the image of earth.

32:00.700 --> 32:03.980
And what is then to be said about everything that's inferior to it?

32:03.980 --> 32:07.940
He abandoned it completely.

32:07.940 --> 32:15.300
Water, fire, air, blue, yellow, light, and so on.

32:15.300 --> 32:21.780
The point is, the principle is you get to discern an image on account of your current thought

32:21.780 --> 32:27.260
or sense objects, but you get to understand there's an image coming first there.

32:27.260 --> 32:31.140
So for most people, they might discern an image, but they'll always put it second.

32:31.140 --> 32:35.860
So they'll put that which is first and second, and their second sight, they'll put it first.

32:35.860 --> 32:42.020
And that's how natural assumption of things from the world first come to me here.

32:42.020 --> 32:48.260
As in here, there, between the two, it's already an image of space in your mind.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.660
And that's what's first structurally.

32:50.660 --> 32:55.740
You wouldn't have any concept of distance, movement, intentionality, if the image is

32:55.740 --> 32:58.580
not there, providing you with possibilities of that.

32:58.580 --> 33:02.100
So the image is fundamental.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.100
Yes.

33:03.100 --> 33:10.220
And when you have a thought of now the fundamental, that's an image in your mind.

33:10.220 --> 33:17.180
Any particular image, content, has the nature of image.

33:17.180 --> 33:19.180
Sure.

33:19.180 --> 33:24.620
There is no image, and now you have something different to an image, within an image.

33:24.620 --> 33:25.860
All you can access.

33:25.860 --> 33:28.300
Is images within images?

33:28.300 --> 33:29.300
You can't step out.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.020
Because any thought of something is not an image.

33:32.020 --> 33:39.740
You can have an image of, so I have an image of a tape measure of this yellow thing in

33:39.740 --> 33:45.860
my hand, and now I can, within that, start looking at different components of that thing,

33:45.860 --> 33:47.580
and all of those are further images.

33:47.580 --> 33:52.820
And even if I don't know what this is for, so I don't have a particular purpose in my

33:52.820 --> 33:59.660
mind of this thing, of color, I have shape, image of color, shape is already in my mind.

33:59.660 --> 34:04.060
And then, oh, so then there is the image in my mind, and there is a thing in my hand.

34:04.060 --> 34:07.020
Thing in my hand is an image in my mind.

34:07.020 --> 34:10.060
So it's mind within the mind, within the mind, within the mind, within the mind, within the

34:10.060 --> 34:14.260
mind, the external world within the mind, the internal thoughts in my abstraction within

34:14.260 --> 34:15.260
the mind.

34:15.260 --> 34:20.380
So the mind comes first and things can never leave the mind.

34:20.380 --> 34:24.940
That mind, not the mind of abstract thinking which is already within the mind I'm talking

34:24.940 --> 34:28.260
about, as in within the image.

34:28.260 --> 34:32.340
You cannot possibly relate to it, you cannot think it, you cannot designate it, you cannot

34:32.340 --> 34:35.580
even fleetingly be aware of, what was that?

34:35.580 --> 34:39.660
You cannot even ask a question in regard to it, if it's not there at least to some extent

34:39.660 --> 34:40.660
as an image.

34:40.660 --> 34:43.020
That extent is an extent of an image.

34:43.020 --> 34:49.780
That's why the casino, literal meaning of casino is extent, totality or something, totality

34:49.780 --> 34:55.020
of the extent, or the extent of totality.

34:55.020 --> 34:59.700
You can't be more specific than that, because that's as specific as it is.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.860
Can you ask a question about something?

35:01.860 --> 35:05.860
So you don't know specifically what it is, but there's something you want to ask.

35:05.860 --> 35:12.100
Oh, I can't remember what it was, but I have a question.

35:12.100 --> 35:18.260
There has to be an image there of that extent, that extent of ambiguity, the extent of lack

35:18.260 --> 35:20.260
of clarity.

35:20.260 --> 35:27.460
Oh, my mind is empty now, it's blank, there is no thoughts in it.

35:27.460 --> 35:30.940
That's the thought of the images there.

35:30.940 --> 35:36.860
So you truly conceiving an objective reality free from you is inconceivable, because that's,

35:36.860 --> 35:41.580
you can only even relate to it in a wrong manner, or right manner, in any manner, because

35:41.580 --> 35:45.500
it's there as an image enduring, how can you even talk about it or think it?

35:45.500 --> 35:53.620
And so if you're able to discern the extent of image, like the image of manifestation,

35:53.620 --> 35:56.860
then you discern everything that has a nature to manifest.

35:56.860 --> 36:02.460
Exactly, and if you also recognize the fact that these images have the characteristic

36:02.460 --> 36:08.260
of, I'm subjected to them, I didn't create them.

36:08.260 --> 36:10.260
Yeah, they have a reason to manifest them.

36:10.260 --> 36:11.260
And there is absolutely no reason for ownership.

36:11.260 --> 36:15.260
They endure, they persist while they're changing, they're enduring.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.260
Images.

36:16.260 --> 36:23.820
Oh, I can, I can put this, I can throw it away, I can use it, I can save it, I can do lots

36:23.820 --> 36:27.100
of things, because an image of it is still there for me.

36:27.100 --> 36:31.420
If you had an image of that, it disappears, either through this body being destroyed or

36:31.420 --> 36:36.260
the counterpart that's necessary, whatever, of my senses being destroyed.

36:36.260 --> 36:38.260
Which is also another image, but yeah, at last.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.260
Which is another image, exactly.

36:39.260 --> 36:43.820
You can't even think of the pure world, pure destruction, pure anything, without having

36:43.820 --> 36:47.540
it manifested as an image in your mind.

36:47.540 --> 36:53.060
They're saying you're subjected to images.

36:53.060 --> 36:57.420
So how can you not be subjected?

36:57.420 --> 36:58.420
What do you think?

36:58.420 --> 37:07.660
So, because if you, you know, an image is there for me, so that's, so that's afflicting

37:07.660 --> 37:08.660
me.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.660
Yeah.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.820
In the sense of I'm being subjected to it.

37:12.820 --> 37:21.140
But if I see that image is just there, I want to see that image is just there, but there's

37:21.140 --> 37:22.900
an image of for me.

37:22.900 --> 37:23.900
Yeah.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.740
But that's an image.

37:25.740 --> 37:26.740
Yeah.

37:26.740 --> 37:29.500
So that's secondary to image.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.500
It's not, why is it secondary?

37:31.500 --> 37:32.500
It's an image.

37:32.500 --> 37:38.020
Secondary, only in your assumed relationship between the two images, the content of it.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.900
What is the content of for me?

37:40.900 --> 37:50.500
Well, it's different in content, like this is not the concept of for me.

37:50.500 --> 37:53.100
What is the content of that tape?

37:53.100 --> 37:56.100
What is the content of it?

37:56.100 --> 38:00.220
Colour, the shape.

38:00.220 --> 38:02.420
And does colour have a content?

38:02.420 --> 38:05.140
They're saying, yeah, yeah.

38:05.140 --> 38:09.540
So I'm saying that when you say content, it's an image, not separate from it.

38:09.540 --> 38:14.700
So it's another image that you yet somehow assume to be the material content of my image.

38:14.700 --> 38:17.460
As if that's not an image.

38:17.460 --> 38:22.460
As if that's not an image, which means any sense of materiality or mentality has to be

38:22.460 --> 38:23.460
within an image.

38:23.460 --> 38:24.460
So type of image.

38:24.460 --> 38:25.460
Type of image.

38:25.460 --> 38:26.460
Yeah.

38:26.460 --> 38:30.460
Why would you worry about that?

38:30.460 --> 38:34.780
It's just instead of two images, start thinking about one.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.660
You said, this is for me.

38:37.660 --> 38:40.780
So there's an image of this, there's an image for me, which is more important there.

38:40.780 --> 38:42.500
The image of this or the image for me?

38:42.500 --> 38:46.580
Well, the image for me, because it's an account for me that I feel and suffer.

38:46.580 --> 38:50.900
So you have an image for me, which has the nature of an image.

38:50.900 --> 38:55.380
So if you understand the nature of an image for me, you understood the nature of all images

38:55.380 --> 39:00.540
that are for you, which is literally anything you would be perceiving.

39:00.540 --> 39:01.540
So that's what I mean.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.180
It's not like comparing and figuring out the relationship between the two images.

39:04.180 --> 39:09.460
Why? Because you're failing to understand the common nature of it, which is it's an image.

39:09.460 --> 39:14.100
But if you are thinking about an image that doesn't pertain for me, means now you're thinking

39:14.100 --> 39:17.340
like a second hand sort of, abstractly.

39:17.340 --> 39:21.380
You want to make it relevant, relevant, which means on the fundamental level of the experience,

39:21.380 --> 39:25.060
which is where the appropriation is, where the sense of ownership, sense of atta, everything

39:25.060 --> 39:26.060
is.

39:26.060 --> 39:29.740
So it's like a suffering.

39:29.740 --> 39:31.540
Suffering, suffering.

39:31.540 --> 39:34.060
What is suffering?

39:34.060 --> 39:35.060
It's an image.

39:35.060 --> 39:36.060
Whatever.

39:36.060 --> 39:37.060
What is suffering?

39:37.060 --> 39:38.060
What is suffering?

39:38.060 --> 39:39.060
What's present in your mind?

39:39.060 --> 39:40.060
Suffering.

39:40.060 --> 39:41.060
What is suffering?

39:41.060 --> 39:45.060
Pain and discomfort.

39:45.060 --> 39:51.900
The pain and the discomfort stands for the image of suffering.

39:51.900 --> 39:55.580
It's an image of suffering, image of pain.

39:55.580 --> 39:57.020
So what is the image of pain then?

39:57.020 --> 39:58.820
What are the characteristics of the image of pain?

39:58.820 --> 40:01.220
How would you describe it?

40:01.220 --> 40:05.220
Which is the necessary image for the image of suffering?

40:05.220 --> 40:09.220
What's the image of pain?

40:09.220 --> 40:16.220
Well, it's not, it is the image of pain, I don't know.

40:16.220 --> 40:17.220
Well, again, it's easy.

40:17.220 --> 40:19.220
I don't say it's not one thing.

40:19.220 --> 40:23.220
Whatever you say, it's probably going to be more accurate than to try to think about what

40:23.220 --> 40:24.220
it is.

40:24.220 --> 40:29.380
Because when I say the image of pain, it's all like, where is the image of pain?

40:29.380 --> 40:33.260
The fact that you're thinking about something means there is the image of that there, to

40:33.260 --> 40:34.260
that extent.

40:34.260 --> 40:38.980
I'm asking you, tell me the extent of the image of pain when I ask you, what is the

40:38.980 --> 40:39.980
image of pain?

40:39.980 --> 40:42.420
I don't tell you, tell me the right image of pain.

40:42.420 --> 40:45.860
What is the extent of the pain when you hear, what's the image of pain?

40:45.860 --> 40:49.860
Displeasure, the uncomfortable, the not wanted.

40:49.860 --> 40:52.740
Not wanted.

40:52.740 --> 40:55.860
So all these things have in common.

40:55.860 --> 40:56.860
No.

40:56.860 --> 40:57.860
No.

40:57.860 --> 41:04.220
That's in common, that's a common attitude to all these things.

41:04.220 --> 41:09.780
This pleasure, this comfort, no wanting means no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:09.780 --> 41:15.660
Is no in things or is no in your attitude in regard to things?

41:15.660 --> 41:18.340
In your attitude.

41:18.340 --> 41:22.140
In your attitude in regard to things you are subjected to.

41:22.140 --> 41:28.300
So where is then the suffering, that you said it has a necessity, image, the resisting

41:28.300 --> 41:29.300
of it.

41:29.300 --> 41:34.220
So it's basically then the suffering is not in the image of pain, the suffering is in

41:34.220 --> 41:38.140
you saying no to the image of pain.

41:38.140 --> 41:45.580
But how can you even say no to an image of pain, to an image, without an image?

41:45.580 --> 41:50.980
Because saying no to the image of pain implies you having, well, saying no to there is an

41:50.980 --> 41:56.660
image implies you having, you can move outside of the space that has a reason based on the

41:56.660 --> 41:58.460
base of that image.

41:58.460 --> 42:03.660
Saying no to this means you can replace it with something else from the outside, yet

42:03.660 --> 42:06.020
all that is within this you are saying no to.

42:06.020 --> 42:15.520
So you are responding to an image, by an image, with another image.

42:15.520 --> 42:19.860
So discerning the nature of images will free you from suffering then, because the image

42:19.860 --> 42:22.740
of pain is not the suffering.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.660
The image of discomfort is not the suffering.

42:25.660 --> 42:30.940
So when I say I am afflicted by images, that is an image.

42:30.940 --> 42:31.940
That's an image.

42:31.940 --> 42:35.460
Which I am afflicted by, that's an image.

42:35.460 --> 42:41.020
Because of another image, which is your attitude of these, which you haven't been seen as an

42:41.020 --> 42:42.020
image.

42:42.020 --> 42:43.020
Yeah, I'm separating that.

42:43.020 --> 42:48.260
That's what the necessary reason for the right view is seeing the sign of your mind.

42:48.260 --> 42:52.020
And then within the now established sign of where your mind is, you can start to discern

42:52.020 --> 42:53.020
these images.

42:53.020 --> 42:56.740
The sign of the mind is an image.

42:56.740 --> 43:02.420
It's the most general image of where my mind is, which most people engage with the senses

43:02.420 --> 43:04.540
in the world today, today at the level they don't see it.

43:04.540 --> 43:10.980
That's why it's a necessary condition for becoming Sotipana, sign of the mind.

43:10.980 --> 43:15.100
But now this is even further where we're speaking, where it's basically seeing the presence

43:15.100 --> 43:21.180
of the enduring, resisting images within that mind of me or whatever else.

43:21.180 --> 43:27.900
So not seeing, exactly, not seeing your attitude of, not seeing basically the attitude of resisting

43:27.900 --> 43:30.020
as an image.

43:30.020 --> 43:35.020
You kind of give it, gratuitously give it more validity on a kind of, you assume it

43:35.020 --> 43:38.140
separate from all the images you're resisting to.

43:38.140 --> 43:42.900
Can you be resisting an image if there is no image there to begin with?

43:42.900 --> 43:51.300
If there is no image of pain, can you be resisting it, inconceivable?

43:51.300 --> 43:56.780
Yet, you somehow assume that you resisting it is the first and then just these things

43:56.780 --> 44:00.900
coming up, moving them away and chasing them away and accepting them and rejecting them.

44:00.900 --> 44:08.740
I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of like phenomenology, just recognising the true phenomenon, yeah,

44:08.740 --> 44:13.820
they're taken to the extreme of basically, you know, just recognising that there are

44:13.820 --> 44:21.100
these images there, these phenomena there that had to be there and that, yeah, they

44:21.100 --> 44:26.380
can't not be there and they're so close to you that you normally look through them and

44:26.380 --> 44:27.380
take them for granted.

44:27.380 --> 44:31.260
Yeah, and you will be taking them for granted because by looking through them, you start

44:31.260 --> 44:36.820
seeing further through and that you see further through and that's how the whole sensuality

44:36.820 --> 44:41.820
proliferates as well because you're also not indifferent to these things.

44:41.820 --> 44:47.340
Every image is simultaneously felt pleasantly or pleasantly or neutrally, has to be.

44:47.340 --> 44:49.340
One of those things has to be.

44:49.340 --> 44:54.020
And given that you have attitude in wanting pleasure or avoiding pain, means some images

44:54.020 --> 44:58.100
will be wanted, which means you'll be going for the content, failing to see the nature

44:58.100 --> 45:02.620
of the image and another images will be rejected, means trying to deny the content, failing

45:02.620 --> 45:04.580
to see the nature of the image.

45:04.580 --> 45:07.140
And that's how you're made bound with the image.

45:07.140 --> 45:13.540
But if you were to see that which is wanted, that which is not wanted, as images, as that

45:13.540 --> 45:14.540
sort of common ground.

45:14.540 --> 45:18.500
That's what I mean, like even these ambiguous things, wanting, do you understand what wanting

45:18.500 --> 45:19.500
is?

45:19.500 --> 45:20.500
Wanting, wanting.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.500
How would you describe wanting?

45:21.500 --> 45:24.100
I'll take a particular example.

45:24.100 --> 45:25.100
I want this.

45:25.100 --> 45:26.660
I want to eat.

45:26.660 --> 45:30.900
So what is my wanting in this particular instance?

45:30.900 --> 45:31.900
Yeah.

45:31.900 --> 45:33.100
Okay, so exactly.

45:33.100 --> 45:36.620
So it has to be, it has to be that thing.

45:36.620 --> 45:38.940
So you can do both.

45:38.940 --> 45:39.940
First take that thing.

45:39.940 --> 45:43.340
Did you have any say in the manifestation of an image of that thing?

45:43.340 --> 45:49.740
If that thing is not, because I see, I'm not seeing the food now, yet I know I want food.

45:49.740 --> 45:50.740
How's that possible?

45:50.740 --> 45:58.100
If the food is generally entirely, solely, fully material, how can I even think it?

45:58.100 --> 45:59.300
It's not.

45:59.300 --> 46:04.300
Spiritual and mental are images first, and they always remain images.

46:04.300 --> 46:10.100
Now they're images that are sort of images of the senses, and they're images that are

46:10.100 --> 46:15.740
images of the mind, but they're all images.

46:15.740 --> 46:20.980
And while the senses, the five senses operate, they will be the images of the senses.

46:20.980 --> 46:28.020
While the mind is there, the mind operates, they will also be the image of the mind.

46:28.020 --> 46:33.460
It's not that the images of the senses, and then there are also, you know, the real objects

46:33.460 --> 46:34.460
of the senses.

46:34.460 --> 46:37.100
Again, object of the senses.

46:37.100 --> 46:40.020
Image upon image upon image upon image.

46:40.020 --> 46:41.020
Or an image.

46:41.020 --> 46:44.260
So seeing an image.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.100
Means seeing the mind coming first.

46:46.100 --> 46:50.620
Seeing an image, and always seeing an image.

46:50.620 --> 46:53.300
Well you don't need to, it's really discerning an image.

46:53.300 --> 46:57.020
It's not like I always have to be seeing the image, because you have no choice but to

46:57.020 --> 46:58.020
see anything else.

46:58.020 --> 46:59.020
Yes, discerning that.

46:59.020 --> 47:00.140
But discerning what you're seeing.

47:00.140 --> 47:04.460
So Putujana sees images, that's all he can see.

47:04.460 --> 47:06.700
Arahan sees images, that's all he can see.

47:06.700 --> 47:11.860
The difference is for Putujana, he misconceives images to be there which they're not.

47:11.860 --> 47:13.740
As being separate from his mind.

47:13.740 --> 47:14.740
Yeah.

47:14.740 --> 47:15.740
Whereas...

47:15.740 --> 47:16.740
Well then the whole idea of separation comes from it.

47:16.740 --> 47:20.580
By assuming external, internal, both, neither mind, not mind.

47:20.580 --> 47:25.660
And what we're talking about here is the direction of unification of mind, of Samadhi.

47:25.660 --> 47:26.660
Unification, exactly.

47:26.660 --> 47:27.660
That's it.

47:27.660 --> 47:28.660
That's it.

47:28.660 --> 47:32.260
Because you discern the unifying contact, the unifying nature.

47:32.260 --> 47:35.460
That's when I ask you first, I say what's in common?

47:35.460 --> 47:39.060
Do you're looking at a tape measure, and you're thinking about not seeing it?

47:39.060 --> 47:40.060
What's in common?

47:40.060 --> 47:45.980
So it's training in regard to the ambiguity of images, not to clarify it into detail,

47:45.980 --> 47:49.980
but to recognize it the extent of its ambiguity.

47:49.980 --> 47:55.820
Because it's only ambiguity of the content, ambiguity of the detail.

47:55.820 --> 47:59.660
Not the ambiguity of the nature of images I'm being subjected to.

47:59.660 --> 48:00.660
That's what I mean.

48:00.660 --> 48:05.060
And not being able to grip with that kind of recognition of that ambiguity, that's why

48:05.060 --> 48:11.460
you don't like wanting, not wanting, all these terms become abstract for most people.

48:11.460 --> 48:16.420
And let alone if you start thinking about emptiness, not self, impermanence, well imagine

48:16.420 --> 48:18.900
how abstract that is.

48:18.900 --> 48:22.380
And abstract means you're not seeing it, that's it.

48:22.380 --> 48:24.220
You're not seeing an image of it.

48:24.220 --> 48:27.780
You're thinking it, which is already a second.

48:27.780 --> 48:32.980
You have a thought, but you aren't seeing that thought as the image that it is.

48:32.980 --> 48:33.980
Exactly.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.900
As an image, and you're misconceiving that thought.

48:35.900 --> 48:36.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:36.900 --> 48:39.620
Because there is an image there, whether you see it or not.

48:39.620 --> 48:47.620
So literally any attitude, as a wanting, so wanting requires you.

48:47.620 --> 48:50.780
So let's dwell on the you aspect of wanting.

48:50.780 --> 48:51.780
Me.

48:51.780 --> 48:52.780
What is the image of me?

48:52.780 --> 48:59.460
The image that comes to mind, the most ambiguous, distant, me, me, me, me, shape of a body.

48:59.460 --> 49:00.460
Exactly.

49:00.460 --> 49:01.780
But that's what it stands for.

49:01.780 --> 49:02.780
Yeah, yeah.

49:02.780 --> 49:05.780
You're not thinking about it, and you end up having all this attitude that it's more

49:05.780 --> 49:06.780
than that.

49:06.780 --> 49:10.260
But whenever you think, that's all it is.

49:10.260 --> 49:15.620
Shape of the body, memory of the face that you see in reflection, place, first point

49:15.620 --> 49:19.140
of view, yeah, place, me, this.

49:19.140 --> 49:26.620
So while you have that image of shape of the body as me, which is me, to have any say in

49:26.620 --> 49:31.220
how that shape of the body has been manifested for me, subjective, what came before, after,

49:31.220 --> 49:34.780
can I even approach it on a step outside of it?

49:34.780 --> 49:38.900
Or am I always secondary to that shape of the body?

49:38.900 --> 49:44.780
Or that memory of the face, of my own face, that stands for when I think of me in my own

49:44.780 --> 49:45.780
name?

49:45.780 --> 49:46.780
No.

49:46.780 --> 49:53.180
Because you were basically locked inside of it, or, sorry, locked inside of it more accurately.

49:53.180 --> 49:58.500
Like, if you look left, right, up or down, whatever, you will be in it.

49:58.500 --> 49:59.500
Yeah.

49:59.500 --> 50:03.780
Oh, so how can I then be the owner of this when all of this has been subjected to these

50:03.780 --> 50:04.780
images?

50:04.780 --> 50:06.780
That's all unsubjected, as well.

50:06.780 --> 50:07.780
That's all unsubjected.

50:07.780 --> 50:09.260
There's nothing outside that.

50:09.260 --> 50:13.220
Oh, but there's more, there's an image of more.

50:13.220 --> 50:17.180
Because you're from a big duty of an extent, more.

50:17.180 --> 50:19.220
Ah, but that's an image.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.220
Yeah.

50:20.220 --> 50:23.220
Yeah, I'm subjected to it.

50:23.220 --> 50:35.260
But I don't like the I am subjected to images, saying that because it gives me the impression

50:35.260 --> 50:36.260
that I...

50:36.260 --> 50:38.260
Well, it gives you space to be separate from it.

50:38.260 --> 50:39.260
I am subjected to these images.

50:39.260 --> 50:40.780
But you have to start like that.

50:40.780 --> 50:41.780
Sure, sure, sure.

50:41.780 --> 50:49.260
But about the body, the senses, the mind is subjected to images.

50:49.260 --> 50:50.780
That's what a mind is.

50:50.780 --> 50:53.460
You can't, there can't be a mind without images.

50:53.460 --> 50:58.660
But if I say manifestation is subjected to...

50:58.660 --> 51:00.820
Yeah, that's absolutely fine.

51:00.820 --> 51:06.260
If that becomes a more accurate way of describing it for you, that's fine.

51:06.260 --> 51:10.140
But for most people, in order to start, you have to start like that and then eventually

51:10.140 --> 51:15.620
you come to click, okay, but I'm subjected to this, I'm subjected to that, I'm subjected

51:15.620 --> 51:16.620
to that.

51:16.620 --> 51:17.620
I am.

51:17.620 --> 51:18.620
I am.

51:18.620 --> 51:19.620
Hmm.

51:19.620 --> 51:20.620
Well, isn't that another image?

51:20.620 --> 51:21.620
I'm subjected to it.

51:21.620 --> 51:25.380
And then you get to upgrade your own description.

51:25.380 --> 51:30.780
But as I said, the starting point is the point of ignorance, the point of mis-conceiving,

51:30.780 --> 51:36.620
which means you will not be able to cease immediately things like the Arahant does, approximating

51:36.620 --> 51:39.620
how Arahant sees you get to understand what Arahant is.

51:39.620 --> 51:42.020
Which is what makes you become one.

51:42.020 --> 51:47.020
All dhammas are another, not self.

51:47.020 --> 51:52.500
Because not self is an image, or self is an image.

51:52.500 --> 51:58.900
Well, you could say that, yeah, the sense of self, as you say, as we kind of just described,

51:58.900 --> 52:06.580
it kind of becomes a more fundamental image than everything else that comes to your senses.

52:06.580 --> 52:10.540
Like whether I'm seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, as you said yourself, it's for me.

52:10.540 --> 52:14.460
So it's that image is in common to all these senses.

52:14.460 --> 52:17.860
So what if I were to then understand and abandon that image, abandon in the sense of

52:17.860 --> 52:22.180
experiencing dispassion and remove the ownership of it, you have removed the ownership of the

52:22.180 --> 52:23.700
five senses.

52:23.700 --> 52:27.740
You have removed sensuality, sense desires.

52:27.740 --> 52:32.420
By removing the ownership of this image of self.

52:32.420 --> 52:33.420
Yeah.

52:33.420 --> 52:34.420
Exactly.

52:34.420 --> 52:35.420
That all these things come through.

52:35.420 --> 52:42.260
That's what we meant by establishing your mind upon the totality of the extent of solidity,

52:42.260 --> 52:47.580
totality of the extent of erineness or whatever I want to translate it.

52:47.580 --> 52:51.700
Basically by practicing casinas, you establish your mind to a certain level, everything inferior

52:51.700 --> 52:55.580
to that is abandoned, or you know, perceptions of the forest to abandon perceptions of the

52:55.580 --> 52:56.580
village.

52:56.580 --> 52:58.900
They had inferior perceptions in regard to that.

52:58.900 --> 53:03.900
As in either way, which doesn't matter how particular perceptions get, this is what they

53:03.900 --> 53:06.860
have in common and you abandon that common ground.

53:06.860 --> 53:11.140
So whether it's sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, the common ground is image of me, for

53:11.140 --> 53:14.540
me, mine, I am.

53:14.540 --> 53:21.900
You abandon that, you abandon all these inferior images within that image.

53:21.900 --> 53:25.620
And by abandoning means not preventing it from arising because you haven't created its

53:25.620 --> 53:26.620
arising to begin with.

53:26.620 --> 53:29.100
It was never a problem.

53:29.100 --> 53:36.300
Abandoning means removing the gratuitous attitudes of resisting it or craving for it.

53:36.300 --> 53:40.220
You will crave for things for as long as you think you can crave for things.

53:40.220 --> 53:44.500
Full understanding that craving is impossible, the way you assumed it, that's how you stop

53:44.500 --> 53:45.500
assuming.

53:45.500 --> 53:49.420
How can you crave for something that's already there?

53:49.420 --> 53:50.420
Exactly.

53:50.420 --> 53:57.580
As I said, oh, I don't see the food now, but I want to crave the food.

53:57.580 --> 54:04.180
If my craving is in the food, if the food is the craving, I would need to be in contact

54:04.180 --> 54:06.260
with it in order to crave for it.

54:06.260 --> 54:07.260
But you are.

54:07.260 --> 54:08.260
I don't even have food.

54:08.260 --> 54:09.820
But you are in contact with it.

54:09.820 --> 54:10.820
Exactly.

54:10.820 --> 54:12.460
But not the content on the domain that I'm craving for.

54:12.460 --> 54:13.460
No, no, no, with the image.

54:13.460 --> 54:14.460
Exactly.

54:14.460 --> 54:18.580
So you realize, oh, so my craving is then on the level of the image yet, I don't stay

54:18.580 --> 54:23.620
on the level of the image when I crave, I go out and seek food and steal food and attack

54:23.620 --> 54:29.660
and kill and work and earn whatever, rightly or wrongly, I go out and seek these objects

54:29.660 --> 54:35.780
because I crave in regard to the image of food.

54:35.780 --> 54:40.540
And that gets paired then with a discomfort of hunger.

54:40.540 --> 54:47.620
So they're naturally associating then seeking this food that I can put in my belly, alleviates,

54:47.620 --> 54:55.260
my gratuitous attitude of resisting pain or physical nature, discomfort of hunger.

54:55.260 --> 55:00.300
But discomfort of hunger, again, it's an image.

55:00.300 --> 55:04.780
An image that literally you can put anything in your mouth, eat it.

55:04.780 --> 55:08.500
You wouldn't worry about the taste then, because you fully stay with the discomfort of the

55:08.500 --> 55:09.500
hunger as a context.

55:09.500 --> 55:13.060
Okay, I have to deal with this, discomfort, because the body will die.

55:13.060 --> 55:17.500
I don't need to crave for it in order to do it, but most people don't act on that level

55:17.500 --> 55:22.700
or most people act on another whole layer added to it, which is, yeah, I'm hungry, but

55:22.700 --> 55:26.540
I want particular taste.

55:26.540 --> 55:31.060
And that's another image that can never be anything other than an image.

55:31.060 --> 55:38.860
But you assume taste to be in the objects of your senses, which is another image.

55:38.860 --> 55:45.860
But you assume the materiality of it, independent of you, and that's why sensuality is wrong,

55:45.860 --> 55:50.940
because it's a perversion of the right order of things.

55:50.940 --> 55:57.260
If you weren't perverting the order, it wouldn't be unwholesome, it wouldn't be wrong.

55:57.260 --> 56:02.060
So things that don't pervert the order are not wrong, such as hunger, putting something

56:02.060 --> 56:05.660
in your stomachs, you're not hungry.

56:05.660 --> 56:14.660
You don't misconceive what comes first, and the purpose then cannot become corrupted.

56:14.660 --> 56:19.620
That's the whole instruction of the word to mindfully, eat mindfully, as in not to observe

56:19.620 --> 56:23.820
every movement of your tongue, but mindful of the purpose why you're eating it.

56:23.820 --> 56:28.180
Like I will eat for this reason, for this reason, I will not eat for this reason, that's

56:28.180 --> 56:36.060
the mindfulness of eating, not chewing, chewing, slowly, slowly, chugging, chugging, chugging.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.060
Yeah.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.980
No, why am I eating is because hunger is there.

56:39.980 --> 56:42.380
So you have an image of hunger.

56:42.380 --> 56:46.940
Image of hunger disappears, as in non-gets replaced image of non-hunger, you stop eating.

56:46.940 --> 56:52.020
Not even a second, what if this taste, because all that became far removed now.

56:52.020 --> 56:54.740
There was never the purpose of the taste to begin with.

56:54.740 --> 57:01.020
The only reason you were even attracted to tastes is because of the pressure of the hunger.

57:01.020 --> 57:05.940
Yet you completely then, as a result of it, gratuitously assumed taste to being the matter

57:05.940 --> 57:11.980
of things that you can somehow access through your eating, access the external world, that's

57:11.980 --> 57:13.940
another image in your mind.

57:13.940 --> 57:19.180
But you think, that's not an image, that's the world, that's the reality.

57:19.180 --> 57:23.980
And by doing so, you always remain bound to then that extent of assumption.

57:23.980 --> 57:28.340
That's the sensuality, the sensual thirst, wanting the object.

57:28.340 --> 57:34.020
How can you want the object unless there is an image of that you're wanting in your mind?

57:34.020 --> 57:35.860
And then what is the object?

57:35.860 --> 57:45.780
And if I'm consuming, crushing, eating, devouring, enjoying, whatever, object, it's another image.

57:45.780 --> 57:48.660
In escapable, you're fully within that.

57:48.660 --> 57:52.860
And when you fully understand it, you cannot even conceive outside of it.

57:52.860 --> 57:57.820
You stop conceiving outside of it, which is sensual domain, which is the assumption of

57:57.820 --> 57:58.820
sensuality.

57:58.820 --> 58:06.620
So contemplating images, people, images.

58:06.620 --> 58:10.660
Contemplating images, not in an abstract sense, but in a sense that they're already there.

58:10.660 --> 58:11.660
Descerning images.

58:11.660 --> 58:13.460
Contemplating images means discerning images.

58:13.460 --> 58:15.940
Whatever it is, my experience is whole, my body.

58:15.940 --> 58:18.300
Image of the body present here.

58:18.300 --> 58:20.340
I don't need to look at it.

58:20.340 --> 58:23.980
The fact that I can see my body is here, even if I close my eyes, means I haven't even

58:23.980 --> 58:29.940
seen the fact that then I can know what to look at when I say my body is here.

58:29.940 --> 58:32.780
Means I have an image that's there.

58:32.780 --> 58:36.180
How would you even know where to look for it, unless the image already implies the direction

58:36.180 --> 58:40.580
of the space, the space for this position and so on?

58:40.580 --> 58:46.900
Yeah, I mean, I've got my eyes closed, I've got my eyes open, still an image, like there's

58:46.900 --> 58:47.900
nothing.

58:47.900 --> 58:48.900
He's just fundamentally changes that.

58:48.900 --> 58:53.380
Yeah, there is an image of the senses and the image of the mind.

58:53.380 --> 58:57.900
The image is there.

58:57.900 --> 58:58.900
And you have both.

58:58.900 --> 59:02.740
The image is there, while the image of the senses and the image of the mind is there.

59:02.740 --> 59:05.980
But you can't attend to it to the same extent.

59:05.980 --> 59:06.980
Has to be one.

59:06.980 --> 59:07.980
That's where the six senses is.

59:07.980 --> 59:13.660
So the image is there and the six types of images are there.

59:13.660 --> 59:20.140
On account of the six senses being there.

59:20.140 --> 59:23.260
That's the sense basis.

59:23.260 --> 59:36.060
It's like a field at the extent that's already an image within which then the sights come,

59:36.060 --> 59:38.660
which are further images within that extent.

59:38.660 --> 59:46.500
If there is no field where sights are, sights will not be manifested at all.

59:46.500 --> 59:53.100
So understanding the six sense basis means you overcome centrality, not by dealing, managing

59:53.100 --> 59:59.380
or getting rid of the objects of your set's basis, uprooting the framework of the basis,

59:59.380 --> 01:00:04.100
uprooting and then removing ownership, and misconceiving lack of discernment, not seeing

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.100
it as an horizon image, the present in yours.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:13.860
That's why like suitors that deal with this, they talk about this, often like for people

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.460
who deal with this abstract, sounds abstract, sounds.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:21.860
And then the idea of abstraction from a mind they cannot understand, the nature of abstraction,

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:28.500
and the other, assuming the extension of this already gratuitously external material reality,

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.060
and then you think all these meditation experiences get to pertain to the extension of this weirdly

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:40.140
assumed external reality, like infinite space.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:45.140
It's the infinity of space, either perception or perception.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:59.660
It becomes immediately like this transcendental universe elsewhere from these senses, magically.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:06.380
Whereas in fact there are images that actually are present, but need to be discerned in order

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.380
to sort of transcend.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:15.260
Yeah, that's what I said in Majima, one by one, when he's developing all the jhanas and

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:20.020
then all the space of infinite space and so on, he would ask himself, oh he's the mode

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:25.140
in this, as in he's the higher, he's the greater than this, but he wouldn't go around to find

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.140
it.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.900
He would just look at the same thing and then see that there is more to it.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.460
He would look at the same log, and he wouldn't go and read a book, and what's the next stage?

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:39.980
Let me find another piece of log that's more liquid than the solid, that no, it's within

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:45.140
the same, there is more, so it's more on the level of the images, not more on the level

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:51.940
of fantasizing about theory of linear connections between things that you already assume to

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:52.940
be.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:02:00.300
And in fact isn't each progressive stage more like the sort of negative of what?

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:05.060
It is here, but that negative is also an outside thing.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.740
That's why there is, even in Putujan experience, there is the element of Nibbana present, which

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:16.260
is why some people, some traditions, completely then jump to conclusions saying, ah so we

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:21.620
are already Nibbana, because the Buddha said we all have element of Nibbana, we do.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.500
Element means present absence.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:33.260
So it's present as an absence, means it's possible to discern it, bring the context

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:39.180
of it, develop the theme of it as the Buddha would say, and that's how you develop it.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:44.020
But saying that present absence means I'm already in that which is absent, because it's

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:49.620
present as an absence, well that's jumping the gun.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.980
So there is the element of Nibbana in everyone's experience, yet the actual Nibbana, there

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:58.720
is the presence of it in everyone's experience.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.420
And that's another good thing to reflect, because you stop assuming it to be at the

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:06.380
end of the world, or at the end of your meditation, observational technique, it's already here.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:11.260
Every minute of your life, element of Nibbana is with you.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:19.940
Understand the theme of that element, understand the characteristics of that absence, there

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.460
is Nibbana for you.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.540
I mean absence of greed, absence of aversion, absence of delusion.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:34.460
And it shares the qualities of all things we've been talking about, this kind of, yeah.

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:39.900
So is there beyond when Saripurta asks, oh is there more than this, means exactly that,

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:45.820
discerning it as a present absence, discerning it as a possibility to develop and develop.

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:51.980
And then later on, as the Buddha says, he would develop it, oh yeah, he verified that

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:56.660
there is more, there was more, now that present absent is not absent anymore, because he fully

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.340
discerned the context of that which was absent.

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:03.380
If there was not even present, even a tiny bit, as an absence, you couldn't go in that

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:07.180
direction, how can you discern something that doesn't exist?

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.580
Hence the element of Nibbana, you know the all the dhātras of the Buddha lists, it's

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:16.060
not the physical elements scattered in the world that you collect like gems or something.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:22.500
It's basically the present absences, the absences of all the absence of dispassion, all these

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.860
themes are present absences, all possibilities to develop in your practice are elements,

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.380
as in the present as absences.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.620
But again, it has to be an image to that extent.

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:40.780
Even if you complete Aṭha essential Putujana, Nibbana, Nibbana, what is Nibbana?

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.740
You have some image, even if it's an image of a word.

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:48.900
And that's what I mean, it closer then represents that ambiguous image, closer represents what

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:54.180
Nibbana is in your experience than when you get to theorize what Nibbana is, because at

01:04:54.180 --> 01:05:01.860
least you're looking in the direction of that absence that is present as such.

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:08.820
That's why some monks needed very little detailed instruction, some monks needed more.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.420
With the minimum instruction they would have turned to the right direction of the right

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.420
absence.

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:20.580
And then dwell on it and understand the context of it and by doing so develop it.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:24.940
Even Jāna is the same principle, the word we say develop the theme of Jāna.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:30.700
Like Jāna is basically so close to the point of view that's why people, that's why it

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.980
takes effort to attain it, to develop it.

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:38.980
It's not like Jāna is figuring something out at the end of a certain effort.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:44.420
Jāna is basically the way you are seeing regarding things that you then got polluted

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:47.140
with your own ignorance, with your own last aversion and habits.

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:53.260
So it's removal of this pollution to basically recognize that certain imperturbable basis,

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.260
unified basis.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.340
Well, whether I think about the sense object, whether I think about joy, grief, an image

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:05.060
has to be there enduring and you become discerning of the enduring image regardless of the content

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.300
of whatever points you.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:11.700
That's already a unified mind and that's already Jāna on account of any experience

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.860
you can have.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:21.860
That's all those different ways of entering Jāna, the comment that is compiled from the

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:26.500
suttas but like looking at the corpse established Jāna, mindfulness of the body established

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.500
Jāna.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.500
So I'm like this results in Jāna.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:35.180
Jāna is an attitude of unification upon certain discernments, discernment of dispassion,

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:42.180
discernment of sensuality, abandoning in that side so it's not the content, it's the

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:58.380
theme, the nature of the image, the characteristics of the unified mind.

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:03.420
So that's always, doesn't matter the experience, whether I'm feeling good, I'm feeling bad,

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:12.620
I'm physical discomfort, physical comfort, whatever it is, doesn't matter how complex

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:21.140
it is, how ambiguous it is, how content kind of inclined it is, image has to be there.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:28.700
Any idea of direction, any idea of the movement, two, four against both neither, requires an

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:32.180
image to be there enduring, some ambiguous image.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:38.220
So it's recognizing, learning how to discern an image in its ambiguity, not try to replace

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:46.380
it with content that you deemed a worthy threshold of it.

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:51.060
Because how can you be exercising the threshold of necessary content unless there is an image

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.020
that needs to be built up to that level?

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:57.620
I just think it's about being skilled, I think it's about being skilled in images, which

01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:02.140
is being skilled in dhamma, being skilled in the mind, seeing the mind quickly.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.860
As soon as it arises, as soon as the image is manifested, he sees it exactly for what

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.860
it is.

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:12.740
He doesn't need to catch himself down the line and then, what, you will need that in

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.740
the beginning.

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.700
It's just like the word for image is dhamma.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.980
Sure, being skilled in dhamma, yeah.

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.300
And that's why this teaching is the teaching, the dhamma, the image.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:29.700
The Buddha was teaching the image, the fundamental image, the universal image in common to any

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:37.020
five aggregates, anywhere in the, any universe or realm, understanding the image.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:44.300
And that image is understanding the nature of images, the extent of images.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:50.220
Not the image extent in terms of telling you how many there are, the extent of the nature.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:54.980
So if he was talking about all these images, it's because it was the context of understanding

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:55.980
the nature.

01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:03.540
The nature of images cannot be owned, cannot be appropriated, cannot be yours, cannot be

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.540
controlled.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.500
You are the one subjected to them, not the other way around.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.500
You understand that?

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:19.700
You are free from the entire samsara, all of it, absolutely, nothing left, samsara, universe,

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.700
rebirth.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:25.100
Yeah, all these different directions, what they have in common, they are an image.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:31.900
Not this image, not that, specifically, maybe in biggers, but as such, an image is there.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:36.780
What else is there when I have these images, oh, it's always me, another image of me is

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:38.100
always there.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.260
So that's kind of more in common to all these other things that you've been dwelling on.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.020
So why don't you dwell on something that's more in common to those particular things,

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.740
as opposed to chasing down particular leads?

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:53.420
And that's how inevitably you will end up to self-awareness, responsibility, point of

01:09:53.420 --> 01:10:00.420
view, all these things we talk about.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:14.900
You don't have to go and have refined images, do you have to have refined images?

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:17.460
They wouldn't be refined images.

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.660
So even the...

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:22.180
If you're refining your images, it means you're not seeing them as images.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:26.420
You're basically chasing the content, which is another image that you fail to see, hence

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:31.340
the idea of refinement, of replacing it with another image of a different kind.

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.060
Yeah, ambiguous images.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:40.940
The true refinement of an ambiguous image is to recognize its ambiguity to be an image.

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.100
That's how you refine it.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:46.020
You don't refine it by providing content for it.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.620
That's likeologization, basically.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:51.420
Yeah, just now we were talking this whole idea of constant, every time you say constant,

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.420
everything else?

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.420
Meaningless.

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:57.660
Well, if you want to establish your mind upon the unified image, then it's meaningless.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:04.300
Being distracted becomes inconceivable, meaningless.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:17.820
As in it's thesis, it's not there anymore.

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:31.980
The mood is an image, has a color to it, has weight to it, that's why the Buddha described

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:40.900
the Sadhipatana for Chitta, elated, expensive, shrunk, depressed, elated, big, small mind.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:44.180
Because yeah, those are images that mind is.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.180
That is what mind is.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:51.620
I'm thinking elation, no, it's like you discerning on the kind of mood, an image that's implicit

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:55.620
in it, but you have nothing to do with it, you haven't created it.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:00.620
You could not have created an image, impossible.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:04.500
I'm creating an image, is an image that you're subjected to and now you're trying to provide

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:09.300
a secondary content to it that would feel more like yours, so you've begun with an image

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:26.580
of the possibility of creating images.
