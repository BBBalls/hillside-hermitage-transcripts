1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
But can you clarify for me what is this Chittanimeda?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No, it seems quite an important term to understand the sign of your mind, so clarify it for me please.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, think of it as we spoke before.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For a round train mind, the attention goes onto something and it's kind of fully absorbed by that.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Even if they practice a degree of reflection, they step back from it.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What is step back into becomes a new actual thing, which means they remain non-discerning the peripheral, the general, the negative in regards to that obviously positive thing that's present.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Be it a feeling, a thought, sight, sound, mouth, taste, touch, anything that cannot be taken.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Your attention determines if it's going to be actual or they will be peripheral, recognizing in regard to it.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So the mind is the sign on the basis of peripheral.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So if you start the sign in the peripheral on the basis of arisen things, then eventually you start recognizing that on that peripheral is what the mind is.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's what Chittanimeda is.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't roll.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, I know, so I'm going back to it obviously. It's not like...

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean, give us this answer and that's it. So the point is to see that feelings and perceptions, all these things, if you were to see the simultaneously present,

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
well, if you were to feel feelings, simultaneously present and perceive perceptions, simultaneously with the feelings that are being felt,

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that will already, that can only be done, that can only be discerned on the basis of mind, discerning the peripheral in regard to the actual arisen and more particular things.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So does that make sense?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Need more, I need more.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So in other ways, you don't even know how to feel until you become mindful.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Does that make sense?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No, it makes you less.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So for a mind that is not developed in mindfulness, basically there's just another one you can say for a mind that is not developed.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That mind, that person, that Tujana, he can't feel properly, he doesn't know what feelings are, because he doesn't understand what is feelings.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He doesn't know how to feel.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And you can see that often the way people speak about feelings, they would use a designation that can only be a part of perceptions.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But even if they don't know what they know, they cannot distinguish between perception and feelings, they feel and they perceive.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, yeah, sure.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They feel that they perceive in terms of obviously the aggregates are there.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There is no feeling there, but they don't know how to feel.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Which means they're just fully and always constantly liable to feeling while its nature remains completely obscured from them.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's what the Buddha said, my teaching is for the one who feels.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Not the one who is sort of touchy touchy and hugging trees and sort of universal love.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, the one who actually recommends the phenomenon of feelings is being present.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And you would see that every feeling in that sense, if you're mindful, you would see that every feeling basically pertains to the mind.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Every feeling is chetastic in that sense, every feeling is mental.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So in that sense, every feeling becomes almost like every feeling becomes peripheral, so to speak.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Even because if you look at the actual feeling, what you're feeling, what you're expecting to find in the sphere of actual is that which you perceive.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So then you usually start associating feeling with heat in your body or with pain in your elbow or something like that.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But that's what goes together.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The simultaneous present, they're inseparable. You can't even conceive them apart, but that's what the feeling is.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And that's why, because people have no basis of proper mindfulness, they have no basis of knowing how to feel.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How to recognize the feeling.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So they cannot, in their perception, recognize that there is actually a feeling present.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because that's peripheral in regard to the actual perception they're staring at.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So where you can start to recognize it.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That which you start to recognize, that's the basically beginning sort of to discern the signs of your mind.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The signs of the phenomenon of the mind, which is perception, determining upon the presence of simultaneous presence of perception and feeling.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So simultaneously present perception, simultaneously present feeling, that experience as a whole is what the sign of the mind, what the mind is.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So getting the sign of the mind is kind of a precursor to fully becoming established in the phenomenon of mind.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So do you mean, can it be something like that?

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You know, you are engaged with some particular being aware of this or that.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But peripherally, you are aware of your, of this, like, that whole concept of your body.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You are talking for it yesterday, but also that there is a mind present, which is the feeling and perception.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, no, no, no, that would be an extra.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I honestly already done layer.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you are mindful of the general in regard to particular, that experience is the experience of the mind that is mindful.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Then if that's what the mind is.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So the mind is this mindfulness?

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, the mind is revealed by that mindfulness.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let me, let me think about it.

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So the mind is this better or is the whole thing?

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, I think for the practice purpose, you can, it will probably be more helpful to think of it as peripheral.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The mind is found in the phenomenon of the peripheral.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why? Because anything that is actual has a reason on the basis of the peripheral.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And then it thinks that to make sense.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Because the mind is precursor of all things.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And so you realize that what has a reason particularly in your perception is only intelligible and discern the such,

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
because the mind was already there very early.

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But at the same time, if the matter of the particular perception was not there, the mind as the field would have not been defined.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, the goal is necessary.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Of course.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:53,000
In other words, it would just be mind existing, but mind cannot exist in its own.

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, you can say mind and body. That's fine.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's not exactly.

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But mind and body are very thorough.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Sorry?

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Mind and body are very thorough.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No, see, that's the thing.

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What is peripheral is only regard to what you are attending to.

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So body is not always peripheral.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you are attending to your body, then the body is actual. Then something else is peripheral.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's not a fixed thing.

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's why it's hard to see it because it's determined by what you attend.

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Not by what you hold to be.

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I see.

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's what holding onto views.

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes.

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like if you get the right view, it will keep redirecting you back to the right point.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you don't have the right view, it takes you completely away.

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Just for that very reason.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yet, inevitably, the way we are sort of formed, the far upgrades, you give priority to that view.

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's being held.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And you can't not hold views because that becomes another view.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You hold.

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So actually, what is peripheral depends on what you attend.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's an actual.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So if you attend your body present in this situation, in this room seated,

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
what's peripheral in regard to that, you can call the mind.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But you will see that the mind becomes negative.

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The mind doesn't appear in the indirect sense.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But say while you are seated, then you start using your hands picking up the cup.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But now, that general body that is present becomes peripheral to this particular engagement.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
With the body.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Which means now, the mind is where that body is.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That general, not the particular one.

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So that's why basically the mind is inseparable from it.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And in the same sense, that's why if you were to liberate that mind, that general mind,

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
from any liability to feelings, wrong views, wrong assumptions, then it becomes intimate.

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because that peripheral is this only.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Just goes.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And for right view, you need to start getting the notions of that peripheral.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I, the signs of your mind, check to know if there is a condition for arising of the right view.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
For the same reason, it is like the previous though, when I was talking about samadhi.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's why samadhi develops mind.

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Develops the same principle.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The composer of mindfulness results in mind development.

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's the expanding of the recognition of the peripheral in regard to the action.
