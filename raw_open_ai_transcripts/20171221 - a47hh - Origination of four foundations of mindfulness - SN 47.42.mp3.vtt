00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
So this is a sutra of four establishments of mindfulness, but it's not called origination.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
It begins very short.

00:17.000 --> 00:25.000
Because I will teach you the origination and the passing way of the four establishments

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
of mindfulness.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
And what figures is the origination of the body with the origination of the uterus,

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
the origination of the body with the cessation which is the passing way of the body.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
So this is the mindfulness of the body.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
So basically what I've been going on and on and on and on about, especially when I was

00:48.000 --> 00:57.000
going against the techniques, meditation techniques, by understanding the mindfulness, by understanding the nature of the phenomena you are mindful.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Because there is no understanding that is not found in mindfulness.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
So by understanding the arising, the manifestation, the nutrition of the body that simultaneously present with the present body,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
you are automatically fulfilling the satikadhan, all the body.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
And again, you can only understand that if you enter right here.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
So it's just…

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes, exactly.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
So the nutrition of the body, the body being…

01:25.000 --> 01:34.000
Well basically, see like every experience, unmindful experience is the experience of, you know, the self-centred point of view.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Like you are the center for your experience.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
So everything is for you, to you, against you, in relation to you and you remain the reference point.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
So even when a person thinks about their own body, it's again, it's this body as mine, as in relation to this center that is me.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
So this body is here and this body can sick and this body, but still he does not question the validity of that assumed center of that experience,

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
which is basically the only one of the experience and that experience, the experience of the body, then he's the owner of the body.

02:04.000 --> 02:13.000
But by recognizing that such a fundamental thing, such as body, for example, taking the phenomenon of the body, is actually not rooted towards this center,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
but it's actually rooted away from it in those random nutrients.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
That is the origination of the body.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
So you realize, not just…

02:22.000 --> 02:33.000
So you realize basically that even when you are unmindfully appropriate body, even that is impossible to be a genuine appropriation because the body remains fully penetrable to you as a phenomena.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
In penetrable to the ownership by that assumed center, because you have nutrient and the body is a result of it.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
When that sees this, the body cannot remain a second longer.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So it's just presence of this, this is.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.000
And you can even think that in a loose sense, you can even think that in a completely kind of the body has been growing old,

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
they're getting bigger, aging, but not in the course of time, doesn't matter, while the nutrient as a phenomena was present,

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
as availability, as a consumption, as a food, and things like that.

03:10.000 --> 03:22.000
But again, so which means this body has been maintained through that direct dependence externally by the nutrient, not by you in any shape of form.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
We couldn't have done it.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
It's a region, a completely different direction from the direction of the center itself.

03:30.000 --> 03:38.000
And another thing is, I think I said that probably a number of times, maybe in recent talks as well,

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
mindfulness, if done rightly, doesn't come from you, comes from the discernment of things.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Because they arise, they're present, and you use that presence as the presence of mindfulness, basically.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
Because that's what mindfulness is, the recognition of presence, whatever, whatever phenomena presence is.

03:59.000 --> 04:08.000
So by recognizing that those things upon which you are mindful are completely independent of you, that mindfulness is done rightly,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
and that's how it becomes satipatana.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
But discerning the independence of the body, that you have been appropriating, the independence of the nutrient upon which the body directly stands,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
that you have also been appropriating and consuming, and so on.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
You realize you can't appropriate that, and that's where the mindfulness is rooted in that discernment.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
That's why it's satipatana with the discernment of the nutrient.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
Not just discernment of the body, because usually there would be this self-centered and then this body, which is still for that self-centered,

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
and then you might contemplate this in a mind, this in you won't actually learn or apply or take root,

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
because you're still doing it from that self-assumed center of self.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
But seeing that it's rooted, that it's actually coming, that roots are coming from a completely different direction,

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
direction that you cannot go to, basically, because you will always remain self-centered.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
You will step away.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Exactly, step away.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
So then it becomes very different.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
Then that body can't be as even if you are appropriating it, which means you're not really appropriating it.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
And a nutrient being a food, organs.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, I mean, again, again, you can just take a nutrient as a phenomena.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
That which nourishes something else.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
That upon which something else is nourished.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Just matter what it is.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
If you look at foods, just food, say the possibility of foods there.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
You don't see the food in relation to the nutrient of the body.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
You don't see the food in relation to being a sancara to the maintenance of the body.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
So in that sense, like a person looks at the food, they just look at another thing that they own,

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
that they possess, that they consume, that they are appropriate.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
So it's about seeing the relationship.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
And you can find the relationship only through the realism body.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Only through the body that's being manifested right there.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And then while it's still right there and then being manifested.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Then through the presence of the body, you can discern the presence of the nutrient.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
And then you'll find out there is that food that you've been finding left and right and up and down away from the body.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
To the presence of the body, there is the nutrients of the particular aspects of the body.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
It's every nutrient for the body that you're not.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah, sure.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Like say, take any, I don't know, a loaf of bread.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
If it's just a loaf of bread as an object of experience,

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
that's just an interesting thing, that you can appropriate, indulge essentially in,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
if you're eating out of pleasure and whatnot.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
But if you, through the mindfulness of your body, through the phenomenon of your isn't body,

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
look for the phenomenon of food, which is that, which sustains the body to be what it is.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
And then through that phenomenon of food, so through the body, through the notion of the phenomenon of food,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
you can look at that loaf of bread.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
So it's still the same loaf of bread, but now it's actually seen in a completely different,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
timeless context.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Timeless, there's in simultaneous, represent context.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Even if you're not necessarily eating the bread right there and then.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
You change the nature of the nutrient upon which the whole body right here and now,

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
that is present stands.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Good body can consume itself.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Yes, that's what I said.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
You have to look at it as the phenomenon of nutrient.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
It doesn't have to worry about the content that it is.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
It doesn't have to worry about the ingredients.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Because yeah, if you're ready for it, the body can be eating itself,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
and getting nutrients for parts with the body.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
But when there's not enough, when there's not any nutrients, there is no body in it.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Exactly.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
So there's no presence of nutrition in that presence of that,

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
that can nourish the body.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
The body and nutrients, you can see it's in separable.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Yes, in separable.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Cannot arise apart from each other.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
So that's the reason why the body is there.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Because of these things.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
No, because of this self-centred assumed sense of ownership.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
These things are also included.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, plural. You can say plural.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It is more correct, plural.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
It's a singular nature of these plurality of things.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
That's why Sankara is like the termination.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
So it's kind of plural.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
The organs, only organs.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
You get open your chest, right? The heart is still seeing very external.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
You see it?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Can you understand what it would be?

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Yeah, the very body, the most personal aspects of the body that you regard as yours,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
are actually as external as their love for bread, as their jar of milk,

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
as that cast iron kettlebell, as this piece of stone.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
It's that kind of matter. It's the same matter.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
It's just the matter that's closest to you.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
It's also a matter because of which you get to see and experience the matter,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
as in objects of your senses.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
So because of that, you just assume a privileged position to it.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
But it's as external as all the sense objects you get externally.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
The body is as external as them, as they are.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
You speak my yesterday about the holiness mentioned before.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
The holiness of the body has been hollow.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
You seem preventively.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
I don't know if it will come inside of feelings or thoughts.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I think it will actually. It's the same thing.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It's not. It's not.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
So the shape of the body is there, the shape of it.

10:04.000 --> 10:13.000
But it doesn't resonate with the sound of you.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
It's hollow.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
The shell. The shell is there.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
But it's not filled anymore with that kind of a life energy of ignorance,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
so to speak, which is the energy of appropriation, assumption,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
up and down and everything else, the energy of mind.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
But yeah, it's still operates.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
For as long as the shell doesn't completely break apart.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
The next part is with the origination of contact.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
There is origination of feeling, dissociation of contact.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
There's a passing way of feeling.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
So that's it.

10:53.000 --> 11:10.000
The next part is with the origination of contact, there is origination of feeling, dissociation of contact, as a passing way of feeling.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
That's a bit more of this trickier.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, it's not in a way like, okay, it is more subtle.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
But you start with the same principle.

11:20.000 --> 11:30.000
So you start with the principle which has discussed that there is a phenomenon on which the phenomenon of the body directly stands.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
It's being nourished by, it's being determined by, it's being found in it.

11:35.000 --> 11:43.000
So in the same sense, feelings, it's inconceivable to have, again, through the presence of feelings, you discern contact.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
Not before the feeling or after the feeling or the other side, not through the presence of, so while the feeling is enduring.

11:50.000 --> 11:58.000
That's why I keep saying the beginning of mindfulness is a recognition of the persisting while changing aspect of there is a phenomenon.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
So whatever it's a feeling, you have to learn how to let it endure.

12:02.000 --> 12:09.000
Thoughts, a reason experiences, experiences as a whole, you need to basically let it endure.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
Allow it to keep changing while remaining the same.

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
And then you can start seeing things through that sort of maintained persistence of an arisen thing.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
So in this case, feelings, if you immediately start like there's a feeling, a feeling arisen.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
And then immediately, on that mind of mind, this is not myself, these feelings are just sensations.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
It doesn't worry that the calabas and what not, I don't know, you start, whatever, whatever.

12:33.000 --> 12:43.000
And of that basically is found in the mindfulness of that feeling that has arisen. Because mindfulness of the feeling that has arisen means allowing feelings to persist on its own terms.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Whether that's pleasant and pleasant, fearful, dreadful, anxious, does matter.

12:47.000 --> 13:01.000
You need to be able to allow it, because only through that, allowing, you can start this, that's like recognizing things as phenomena, basically, allowing them to arise for what they want to arise, and for however long they want to arise.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
So if the feeling is allowed to arise, through that, then you can start discerning contact.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
And you could see, what was the nature of the nutrient in relation to the body?

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
It was something that you could not own. It's something that's always like underneath that body.

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
So your ownership stops at the threshold of the body. That's where body is mind, and then these things are for the body and what not I, for me, and similar.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
But when you recognize that, no, this body that I regard as mind actually directly stands upon other things than me, not me.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
It stands upon these things that we can call nutrients.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
Then you see, it's impossible for you to own those nutrients in such a manner.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
You can't. Your ownership cannot go through the body of the possession of nutrients. They're always going to be step below you.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
Now, below your reach, basically. So as far as you reach, they're going to be a step further than that. That's just the nature of it.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
So that's how you recognize that you cannot appropriate the body. Why? Because even if no matter what sense of ownership you have,

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
that body stands upon these nutrients, which if they disappear, the body will disappear, any sense of ownership will disappear.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
That's how you stop regarding your sense of ownership as your own as well.

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
And now, the second paragraph tells us that the context shares the same nature. You can't own it. You can't access it. It's always going to be step below you.

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
So that's important recognition to sort of discern, because people do and pay that based on the traditional interpretations of contact.

14:29.000 --> 14:40.000
You think you can prevent it. You think you can prevent contact by shutting your eyes, by closing your ears, turning your head away, walking away, you can't.

14:40.000 --> 14:52.000
So that body that's thrown out there in the world, based upon these nutrients, subject to these elements, that body is being contacted constantly for as long as those, for as long as that shower remains.

14:52.000 --> 15:06.000
So you can't stop contact. You can only stop appropriating that which is being contacted. As a result of which, your feelings will be hollowed out.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.000
So it comes like perception. Yeah, but again, you're thinking about a contact now, and you should only through your reason feeling.

15:14.000 --> 15:23.000
So whatever feelings you have now, presence, presently enduring, through that you discern, there is that which is contacted.

15:23.000 --> 15:34.000
And so if you want to pin down contact onto something, you could really just kind of call it a general designation and say, it is that body that's contacted.

15:34.000 --> 15:43.000
So now the body is kind of a nutrient, so to speak, for the feelings to arise, the presence of the body in the world.

15:43.000 --> 15:51.000
Or even more, inside and more accurately, you can say, the presence of the senses in the world is the basis for the feelings to arise.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
The sense experience. Yeah.

15:54.000 --> 16:04.000
But sense experience, not in these senses of mind, but those sense organs in that body that stands upon those nutrients.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
So that's why you can't just skip to the second about feeling a contact and forget about it first.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
It's the same principle that needs to be built up from the start correctly.

16:15.000 --> 16:25.000
So only when you're mindful of the body properly in that sense of nutrient, then the contact can become apparent as that sort of discern through feelings and further and further.

16:25.000 --> 16:38.000
Now then later on, once you sort of fully understood that you become proficient in these four satipatanas, and then you don't necessarily have to keep doing them in the same order, but clearly you could see, there's no satipatana without right contemplation.

16:38.000 --> 16:47.000
No, there is no right contemplation, there wouldn't result in establishment of mindfulness or samadhi.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, hold on that.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
So you like to like, okay, so I have to put in this, then I think body nutrients are now going to step two, step three.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
No, you just keep drilling the same principle on different levels.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
First, on the obvious level, body nutrients, and the same principle on the level of feeling and contact.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
That was the contact that you speak.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
So, no, you can really, that's true if you're an arrahan.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
If you're a protusion, you say, with feeling that it's contact.

17:17.000 --> 17:25.000
Like if you're approaching to satipatana, first you're going to see feeling through which you can discern a contact.

17:25.000 --> 17:36.000
In the impersonal sort of description of a way, you would say, yeah, contact is a new trend for people.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
But from your point of view, which is the only point of view you have, or which is the only point that you have,

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
you have feeling through which, in the same sense, you have body through which you discern nutrients.

17:48.000 --> 17:56.000
And then you stop, basically, placing emphasis on the side of body as my body, in relation to me.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
On the side of feeling, there's my feelings in relation to me.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
But you recognize the emphasis is against your will, against your control.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You can't even conceive, to change that.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
It's actually rooted in some kind, in the dominations, not in you.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
And that's how you stop regarding things as yours, not because you want it.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
But because you realize it's impossible to not, not do it.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
So you, they are, they cannot be yours, even if you want to.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
So you just have to recognize the thoroughly.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
So you start with the body through which you discern simultaneous presence of random nutrients.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
They are not the body.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
You start with the feelings through which you discern, they has been contact.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
And it's still there in dealing, because these feelings are in dealing.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
So you always want to ask why instead of feeling, why is that?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Well, see, that's the same body.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah, well, yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:57.000
But see, you would ask that because for you, contact seems, well, it's still regarded as optional.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
So then you ask why is it then?

18:59.000 --> 19:07.000
The fact that you think your question can pertain to the nature of contact means you think you can put it in question.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
But that's already a form of accessing it.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
And only it, and relating to it.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
You can put your feelings in question.

19:16.000 --> 19:23.000
And if you look why they are there, you would see, because it has been contacted.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
Or contact has a reason.

19:29.000 --> 19:38.000
Don't think of contact as that kind of, I don't know, whatever they describe it, in commentaries or like a medical, you know, description of it either.

19:38.000 --> 19:48.000
Basically think of contact as a manifestation of pressure.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Not perception.

19:50.000 --> 20:02.000
Well, you can say it, but I don't think you have to shed any more light, because perception already has lots of assumed motions attached to it.

20:02.000 --> 20:11.000
Think of it as pressure. So you can have a very agreeable pressure, which is then felt pleasantly.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
And you could again, the reason why I say pressure is because pressure remains.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
For as long as there is pressure being felt, you know, it's being pressured, it's being touched.

20:20.000 --> 20:32.000
It's being felt in a felt context.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
It's being felt, or rather feeling is inseparable from contact.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
Even honestly, realize all this, and you're feeling the contact.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
But because there is that in the world, that can be pressured.

20:45.000 --> 20:53.000
That can be touched. That can be contacted. That is feeling simultaneously present right there in your mind.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
But there is no linear connection that you can observe.

20:56.000 --> 21:10.000
In the same sense, there is no linear connection between uterine and the food, because if it were, you were not seeing it as a simultaneously timelessly present principle of nutrient and that which is being determined by the nutrient.

21:10.000 --> 21:17.000
Exactly. So if you start like a contact, a hair, and then goes this, and sensations, and then this is the feeling, that's all out there.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
None of that is actually what you are feeling, and the pressure that's underneath that feeling.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
Because take up any feeling. Again, you have to start through feeling, pleasurable feeling.

21:26.000 --> 21:35.000
So there is a, there is a agreeable pressure to found through that pleasurable feeling.

21:35.000 --> 21:46.000
Painful feeling can persist for days, which means for the whole time, the disagreeable pressure persists.

21:46.000 --> 21:55.000
The disagreeable contact has a reason. The disagreeable contact is being manifested, or other is manifested.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
The disagreeable contact is persisting while it's changing.

21:59.000 --> 22:08.000
The disagreeable contact is enduring. The pressure is enduring.

22:08.000 --> 22:22.000
So by seeing that pressure and feeling are two different things, but completely inseparable, then you will stop regarding feeling as yours, and then pressure on body.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.000
I want to say it's the same thing, I know it's two different things, but it's the same thing.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
Well, it's not the same thing. It is two different things, that are simultaneously present.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Do you get that?

22:36.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah, you can say that, they are conjuring, there's the one in the same, in regard to the perception, that's kind of one of them.

22:43.000 --> 22:57.000
Well, they're not the same. But you cannot think them about either. So one is found through the other, through the other.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
So think of feeling, you're already implying pressure within the feeling.

23:03.000 --> 23:15.000
Just what I think of feeling, feel the feeling, you're already, there is already pressure. We did that feeling while, that's important being, while, not after or before, but while it is being felt.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
So feeling is inseparable from the pressure.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
And same.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
Pleasurable, very agreeable. Get light for feelings.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Yeah, it's a very agreeable pressure.

23:29.000 --> 23:41.000
Neutral. Neutral feeling again, yeah. Well, it's basically neutral pressure. Neither agreeable, nor disagreeable pressure.

23:41.000 --> 23:49.000
And that's what contact is, or rather you'd be much better of thinking of contact in those terms.

23:49.000 --> 24:09.000
And you don't need to designate it any more accurately. It's quite sufficient, actually, because the whole purpose of it is to see that simultaneous dependence, simultaneous relationship of this is being nurtured, simultaneously, while it is present, by contact.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
And that's how you can own it. It's not rooted in you.

24:15.000 --> 24:30.000
So, yeah, passing contact is worth feeling.

24:30.000 --> 24:38.000
So by discerning contact, through the feeling, you automatically stop appropriating feeling.

24:38.000 --> 25:01.000
That's what I really meant when he said, in order to approve the thing that's been taken as yourself, you have to see it as directly depending upon that, which is not at the same time taken as the self.

25:01.000 --> 25:10.000
Because if you look at low for bread, or if you look at the raw pressure or contact separately, yeah, you'll take that as yourself. You'll appropriate that.

25:10.000 --> 25:20.000
But if you discern that through the feeling that is at the time then taken as a self by default, then that won't be able to be taken as a self.

25:20.000 --> 25:38.000
Yet you see it as that, because of which this, that you did it take as yourself depends upon. Then it will as well, then I myself am not my own. Thus that is not self.

25:38.000 --> 26:02.000
So, and you're saying yesterday, it's hardiness. Yeah, so when the feeling is not yours anymore, basically that, that trail of that pressure that has been exhibited on you remains that that, you know, the imprint, so to speak, can persist for a while.

26:02.000 --> 26:10.000
But now it's been, well, drained out, so to speak. It's not charged anymore. There is no charge to it, because it's not yours.

26:10.000 --> 26:19.000
So then it's just a different extent of different amount of hollowing that the pressure has exerted.

26:19.000 --> 26:40.000
So in that sense, the point is, it's not just like a, I don't know, it's sort of like, it's not basically completely unaware, unrecognizing of any feeling enemy. He's not a robot.

26:40.000 --> 26:51.000
So the significance that the pressure of a certain experience is still very much there to the extent that he wants to go. That's why Arvant is not afraid of death.

26:51.000 --> 26:58.000
He cannot even conceive the fear of death. That doesn't mean because he's not aware what death is on the contrary.

26:58.000 --> 27:13.000
So he's actually the only being that is, that is capable of fully comprehending and grasping the imprint, the pressure of the experience of death, and even that cannot overtake him anymore.

27:13.000 --> 27:25.000
So in the sense that other feelings, while he's still alive, other pressure that's being exerted, different significances, somebody comes instead of killing all the monks around him and stuff, he's not like, oh, what is happening?

27:25.000 --> 27:37.000
He knows exactly what's going on and he feels that amount of hollowing towards him, that used to be the feeling, that used to be that pressure exerted on him, but now he cannot engage on that level.

27:37.000 --> 27:48.000
So he's completely beyond it, but he still recognizes the degree of that hollowing that used to be felt.

27:48.000 --> 27:58.000
That's why it's empty, little empty big empty, but it doesn't matter, it's empty, that's the point.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
So little feelings are little empty, big feelings are really empty.

28:03.000 --> 28:18.000
The point is the nature of that emptiness, that hollowing, that draining away, disowning, dispatching, all of that is just completely extinguishing.

28:18.000 --> 28:36.000
So yeah, like a hollow stump, as the Buddha would describe it.

28:36.000 --> 28:51.000
The position of Pasa as touching or pressure as opposed to contact always goes any more if you have to.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
Who was just saving in there? Somebody who? You just did.

28:56.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah, but they're not in a sense, they're in a certain sense, they are not touching, so to say.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah, exactly, there is that pressure or hollowing because he's not pressured anymore.

29:10.000 --> 29:18.000
The point is when people think contact, they think of something that has happened, that is done, but that's not so.

29:18.000 --> 29:31.000
So if the pressure descend the contact through the feeling, they're right here happening now, which means contact is right there for that whole time and during, through it, through the feeling.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
So if there is no that pressure, there wouldn't be any feelings.

29:36.000 --> 29:51.000
And you realize that which is being pressured, it's the level of those nutrients and the level of that body that's not in your control.

29:51.000 --> 30:06.000
Whereas it's just, you can't even imagine it. Yet you know it's there because why? Because you feel. And you discern it through those feelings that are being felt.

30:06.000 --> 30:21.000
That's where you start the body seeing that body currently, just getting the grip, the notion of the principle. And then you can start what's beyond this. Sorry? You might get larger, or what if I looked in there.

30:21.000 --> 30:30.000
Well, it becomes more discerning of the principle, which means that it's a universal principle, that it's present in everything that is arising. That's why it's a universal principle.

30:30.000 --> 30:45.000
And then you don't have to keep repeating. You just start seeing it because, yeah, it's arising thus it's but taking to this nature of the same principle that you have understood.

30:45.000 --> 31:01.000
Yeah, and even now, like, there was never like a special contemplation within feeling and the contemplation, and I think I might have read that too, but I don't even remember it. But the point is, you look at the principle and you see exactly what's there. And how it has to be.

31:01.000 --> 31:13.000
And more skilled people would maybe describe it in even a greater detail, more accurately. But that's irrelevant. What's important is to see the principle, because that's what's freezing from suffering.

31:13.000 --> 31:22.000
Fully developing that is how you become another.

31:22.000 --> 31:47.000
With the origination of name and form, there is the origination of mind, the cessation of name and form. Now let's get in your modifying. But no matter how refined it gets, it doesn't mean it's getting more intricate or more complex.

31:47.000 --> 31:54.000
It is becoming more subtle within the same principle or principle that was pertaining to the first thing that you read.

31:54.000 --> 32:02.000
And the second thing, and the third thing, and then the fourth thing that you read.

32:02.000 --> 32:10.000
So what is then the next thing that people regard as mind? The body, the feelings, and the next thing would be, oh, my mind.

32:10.000 --> 32:22.000
This ambiguous presence of this mental energy, or not, I will not call it. That's what mind, basically. The mental. It's the closest to it.

32:22.000 --> 32:34.000
It's closer, more closer than your feelings, and it's more closer than your body. So how you disown that? Well, by letting it endure, by seeing either eyes,

32:34.000 --> 32:42.000
and by through its presence, discerning that upon which the mind has to be standing, which is not you.

32:42.000 --> 32:52.000
And that's name and form. That is the or. Anything that can possibly manifest itself.

32:52.000 --> 33:04.000
So you can say the manifestation. And that's something you cannot prevent. In the same sense, the pressure is being exerted because of which you feel something you cannot prevent.

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
In the same sense, the body, depending on the nutrients that are nourishing the body somehow, it's something you cannot prevent.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
You cannot be eating nutrients, and providing nutrients, and saying, may these nutrients not nourish the body, no.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
They're nutrients because they nourish, because the body directly stands upon it.

33:19.000 --> 33:26.000
So it's the same principle, just a course, a course, a form of it. But for the mind, which is out there, it's again the same.

33:26.000 --> 33:34.000
Like the mind would be inconceivable without the natural manifestation upon which it stands, without name and form.

33:34.000 --> 33:42.000
Without that body, that form, and that mental capacity in regard to it, your mind would not be there.

33:42.000 --> 33:49.000
So then you recognize that that body and the mental capacity in regard to it, I, the consciousness, that's not yours.

33:49.000 --> 33:56.000
Because they've discovered it through that determination, that is the determination of the mind.

33:56.000 --> 34:03.000
Which means the domain of those things are inaccessible to you, the domain of now root God.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
The domain of Pasa is inaccessible to you.

34:09.000 --> 34:20.000
And so you cannot not experience the pressure, what you can do is semantic internally.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
And fourth one is the origination of the attention, that is the origination of phenomena.

34:25.000 --> 34:36.000
What's even such a thing that you mind, the particular movements of your mind, the level of jumps, the level of sort of pokes, the directions, that's what attention is.

34:36.000 --> 34:43.000
But again, what does the attention depend on?

34:43.000 --> 34:52.000
Just, well actually so, what I said for the third, it's actually more accurately said for the fourth, the natural manifestation.

34:52.000 --> 34:59.000
So you can take an avarupa, what does an avarupa has as its nature, it's to manifest itself.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
So if you take the natural manifestation, what is corresponding, attention.

35:04.000 --> 35:11.000
Because of that you can jump at it, because of that you can direct a bolted.

35:11.000 --> 35:25.000
So when there is a tending to something, when the attention is present, then what you have, through what you can discern through that attention is, the thing has a reason.

35:25.000 --> 35:48.000
So if you can attend it, it's because it was given beforehand as an option to be attended to.

35:48.000 --> 35:55.000
But then you recognize, so me, moving my attention, it's completely secondary.

35:55.000 --> 36:02.000
That's only possible, because this thing has a reason beforehand, because of which I am attending to it right now.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
And that arising is something you are not saying.

36:05.000 --> 36:14.000
Thus, your attention, then, cannot be yours, because your attention cannot not depend on this random arising of things.

36:14.000 --> 36:21.000
It's just inconceivable. What is there to attend there? How can you even think of attention?

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
So that's even something. But again, you could just take the first one, the first one.

36:25.000 --> 36:33.000
That's what the Buddha said, oh, he just remains mindful of this body there, to the extent necessary for the final knowledge.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
So this is just for different, basically different capacities, different people would have.

36:39.000 --> 36:46.000
For some people, pondering on the principle between attention and the manifestation that's manifested through the attention,

36:46.000 --> 36:55.000
because of which attention is there in the first place, is quite a palpable thing to contemplate on, to keep in their mind.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
But for some people, it wouldn't be.

36:57.000 --> 37:10.000
So that's why he laid out the principle in all four gradually increasing in subtlety descriptions of the same principle.

37:10.000 --> 37:17.000
Why? Because if he only done it in terms of the body, then those people who were able to think more subtle things would see,

37:17.000 --> 37:27.000
in the mind you would figure it out himself, that it's the same principle, but the Buddha being the Buddha-gottam being the one who's foremost in teaching the Dharma would have expanded in every possible subtle way.

37:27.000 --> 37:34.000
Like actually, now he comes to my mind, that other Sutta Indigene kaya, the Buddha with Pasi, previous Buddha,

37:34.000 --> 37:41.000
the Buddha gives a story of him, whereby he, as a bodhisatta, descend the principle of Patitsam Bhada, before he became Buddha.

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
And then, and then he starts describing it, a Viji Pachasankara, and so on, and then he comes to,

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
number upa determines the Vinyana, and then Vinyana determines another Upa.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
And that's where his bodhisatta ended. He did not take it further into a Viji and everything else, and says,

37:58.000 --> 38:07.000
when he kind of finished sort of clarifying that formulation, then he remained mindful of the rising and falling of the manifestation of the five aggregates,

38:07.000 --> 38:16.000
on the experience as a whole, for a period of time until his mind was fully purified, and he became some of some Buddha.

38:16.000 --> 38:26.000
So you could see that that some of some Buddha was not as detailed, as prolific, as the Buddha in terms of defining the principle to all its possible subtleties,

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
but the Buddha was, but it's still the same principle.

38:31.000 --> 38:38.000
So in other words, I'm saying, take up just the first paragraph that you read, and perfect that principle,

38:38.000 --> 38:49.000
develop it, like take it as far as you can, and it will result in the, your attention being freed from assumption in regard to manifestation.

38:49.000 --> 39:04.000
It's a blanket, basically, again. You have a particular disease, a particular bacteria attacking you, and you start giving a broad spectrum, antibiotic,

39:04.000 --> 39:11.000
that it's not so strong, so you have to do it longer, but eventually you will wipe out all the negative, all the harmful bacteria.

39:11.000 --> 39:20.000
Or if you're very accurate, if you have such capacity, you only get a very specific antibiotic, they will very specifically kill only the harmful bacteria.
