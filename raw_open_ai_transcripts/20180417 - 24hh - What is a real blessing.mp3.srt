1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,680
What is a real blessing?

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,960
What is the real blessing?

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,840
Sometimes people ask monks for blessings, but what is the real blessing?

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:33,440
Well, I guess you can define it a blessing is something that's going to be beneficial for

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,520
your well-being in the future.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,200
That's just off the top of my head to define blessing.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:52,880
So if you take that as a criteria, then you can see that actually fundamentally you are

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,200
the only one who is responsible for your own blessings.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,040
You can't have somebody bless you.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:06,240
Well, you can have somebody bless you if somebody comes and tells you what to do, properly

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,920
accurately in terms of the mind development, in terms of the virtuous life and that kind

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
of inner growth.

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,800
Yeah, that person is sort of giving you blessings.

14
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,920
I.e. he's basically giving you opportunity to bless yourself.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,800
But most often people just resort to blessings as a form of superstition, which is the

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,920
sole point of it is to cover up the existential anxiety, fear of basically life, because you

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,120
recognize that you're not in your life, you're bound with the life, you're bound with your

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,560
attachments, with your wants, with your desires, with everything.

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,240
But deep down you know you're not in control of it, and any second it can be taken away.

20
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,400
So that recognition is dreadful.

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,680
So a person without any wisdom, without an instruction of guidance would basically have

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,680
to turn towards distracting himself from it.

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,680
But sooner or later it starts to catch up and that's when people become religious, superstitious,

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,040
engaging all sorts of rituals and blessings and needs, just to to mark, to cover up to

25
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,760
like, no, I will be fine.

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,560
Because you recognize that fact that you're not in control right here and now and that

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,880
your future is uncertain, because you might not live next moment.

28
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,960
But blessings being pertaining to your well-being in the future, you feel blessed now, you sort

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,800
of smooth over the anxieties of the future.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,680
So you basically bring you some sort of peace, but it's not a, it's not a, it's not actually

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,680
peace that kind of fixes the problem, it's the peace that comes from ignoring the problem,

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,680
which is not really the peace.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:49,560
So being virtuous yourself being virtuous yourself, may keeping the acts of virtue, upholding

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:58,640
the virtue, upholding the non-ill will, non-sensuality, non-hatred, non-slender, wrong speech, inciting

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,320
violence, anything basically and wholesome, non-indulgence, you can, you can be rest sort of

36
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:15,960
assured that that is, that is a relatively universally accepted, blessful behavior, so to speak.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,400
It will, it will result in your, in the future well-being.

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,840
And that's what it's meant when, you know, like, with the five precepts we spoke before,

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,760
they would say, like, the Buddha would say, it would, it would provide you with confidence

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,520
and you have nothing to fear, because you know, with these criteria that I'm upholding

41
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,160
strictly for virtues, behavior, non-ill will, non-indulgence and so on, you start recognizing

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,640
it good as they are, and then you see, yeah, this will most certainly be good for me even

43
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,640
in the future, so you have confidence upon it, so then you don't have anxiety, right?

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Because why?

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,680
Because you're not, not misbehaving.

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,000
You have no, you're not giving in to anything unwholesome, so you, you feel protected with

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,440
your own actions, and you can't ask for higher blessing than that, if the blessings

48
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,240
would truly depend upon somebody else, which means you would always be the mercy of someone

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,920
else as well, which would bring you back to the nature of your anxiety as it is right

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,160
now, or you're not in control of you, or the mercy of elements, circumstances, accidents

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,840
and what not, you're in mercy as something else.

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,560
So if you want real blessing, is the blessing that you can make a difference, you can sort

53
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,080
of have an input in, and that's the blessing that I'm talking about, of a virtuous behavior.

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
And there is no nobody in between there, so nobody can take your credit away, nor can

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,080
you blame anybody else if you don't do it, it's on you.

56
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,720
No, you can take your blessing away.

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Exactly, exactly.
