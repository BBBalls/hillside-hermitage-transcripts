00:00.000 --> 00:22.280
But that's what I mean when I say you don't want to have to do anything on account of suffering.

00:22.280 --> 00:28.160
You don't want to have to manage it, you don't want to have to do this when it arises like

00:28.160 --> 00:32.240
this, so do that when it arises in a different way. You want to find a place and that's what

00:32.240 --> 00:37.740
Dhamma is all about whereby you can't even suffer in the first place. So you're not

00:37.740 --> 00:42.080
just free from any actual suffering, you're free from possibility to experience suffering.

00:42.080 --> 00:47.280
And in a way that did say similar, the Buddha, the Dhamma doesn't free you from this

00:47.280 --> 00:53.880
unpleasant experience with that, but it freezes from the nature of experience altogether.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.640
So again talking about the impermanence of the stone or the tree or modern science

00:57.640 --> 01:03.640
of prune, the molecules are changing. Who cares? It's not a little relevant.

01:03.640 --> 01:09.720
Like you can say that the moon is like this, the sun is like that, these are the chemicals.

01:09.720 --> 01:16.680
It absolutely makes no difference to the existential aspect of your daily life where you feel.

01:16.680 --> 01:22.680
Well, it's another perception, it's another view, it's another external explanation.

01:22.680 --> 01:26.600
So you have to be honest with yourself and see whereby there is a suffering and you start

01:26.600 --> 01:33.520
using a method to deal with that suffering, be it science or the sutras or psychology or

01:33.520 --> 01:38.160
psychotherapy or any other religion. You have to be honest with yourself to see if that

01:38.160 --> 01:46.040
method pertains to management of suffering or to actually uprooting it all together.

01:46.040 --> 01:52.280
And you'll find out that Dhamma, only Dhamma only correctly practice uproots the suffering.

01:52.280 --> 01:56.640
Everything else is a management and it's a response to suffering. The whole psychotherapy

01:56.640 --> 02:02.000
thing that's big in the West is just managing the symptoms, not being able to cure yourself

02:02.000 --> 02:08.200
in the actual illness. And that's why we say people, it's wrong. We say, well, it helps.

02:08.200 --> 02:14.320
Well, it helps on a level of potential and a mundane level. If you were to know clearly

02:14.320 --> 02:19.800
that what you're doing is not the medicine, medicine against suffering, it's only managing

02:19.800 --> 02:23.920
the symptoms. If you're very, very clear on it, like you know when you're taking a drug

02:23.920 --> 02:28.720
that can screw you up, so you're very careful, you know, okay, well, he just wants you

02:28.720 --> 02:35.520
too much so that I can go and find a proper drug. Then, sure, okay, when the mind is weak,

02:35.520 --> 02:41.360
there's no right view inside. People will need that kind of support. But actually actively

02:41.360 --> 02:45.960
practicing, nobody will do it that way. Why? Because if you already have that much self-transparency,

02:45.960 --> 02:51.440
you find that help in the suit as already. You wouldn't need a Western take on kind of

02:51.440 --> 02:59.080
psychological quasi medicinal, who knows what explanation of the mental states. But people

02:59.080 --> 03:03.360
don't see that, which is why basic, and the reason why it's wrong is because then they

03:03.360 --> 03:08.120
assume that's the practice of done. It's the same, which is why there are lots of monks,

03:08.120 --> 03:12.480
lots of senior agents, they go to the psychotherapy workshops and stuff, as if that contributes

03:12.480 --> 03:19.760
to their demo practice. As if that can contribute to the demo practice. It can't. Because it

03:19.760 --> 03:24.600
just pertains to a completely different thing. And the worst bit about it is thinking that

03:24.600 --> 03:28.360
by doing that, you're doing demo. Means then you won't be looking for the right cure

03:28.360 --> 03:33.400
because you think you're having it. If you think the management of a symptoms is the

03:33.400 --> 03:37.400
cure actually of your illness, you won't be looking for the right cure of your illness

03:37.400 --> 03:42.760
because you're thinking of curing it. So you have to be clear with yourself to recognize

03:42.760 --> 03:46.240
whether it's really curing it or is it managing it.

03:46.240 --> 03:54.560
And if there was something you need to manage, well that's what seal is for. Again, psychotherapy

03:54.560 --> 04:01.160
is not needed. Western science is not needed. It's actually a wrong view. It's a view that

04:01.160 --> 04:05.880
assumes the public world accessible to all of us at the same time, whereby matter is

04:05.880 --> 04:10.840
measurable. As will the same matter is always below your feet. Never, it can never appear

04:10.840 --> 04:16.280
in your experience. All you're going to have is number upa, kind of normal in relation,

04:16.280 --> 04:21.600
a designation in relation to the offender resistance. So things are much more subtle and much

04:21.600 --> 04:27.800
more contemplative complicated than taking up a ruler or doing like, you know, some

04:27.800 --> 04:36.600
equation in physics or whatever else. That's explanatory. It defines the world in its own

04:36.600 --> 04:39.560
terms, terms that are developed by science. And that's what I can hear in the economy.

04:39.560 --> 04:45.840
You can't use science or any other discipline of that kind to explain your experience because

04:45.840 --> 04:50.960
your experience precedes them. Whether your scientist feels for whatever or nothing, you

04:50.960 --> 04:59.960
exist. So you can then go and develop yourself, concoct, scientific explanations, observations,

04:59.960 --> 05:05.800
and then use them to explain the tools that you used to recognize those explanations.

05:05.800 --> 05:11.640
And in other words, you can't use your senses to access the existence of your senses. Your

05:11.640 --> 05:17.600
eye cannot see your eye. You can't hear your own ears. So relying on the measure of

05:17.600 --> 05:23.560
the sound to explain your ears, it's in a state because it requires your ears beforehand.

05:23.560 --> 05:30.240
So you can't use it to explain its roots because it's a result of it, not a cause of it.

05:30.240 --> 05:35.600
Which is why the only way to access these things is phenomenology. And by that, I don't

05:35.600 --> 05:41.880
mean Western philosophy. I mean phenomena, knowledge of phenomena, phenomenology, which

05:41.880 --> 05:55.400
is what pertains to the mind, which is what the mind is. Well, within your understanding

05:55.400 --> 06:03.840
how would you call what samadhi is? Well, I was just reading the agenture. It's the establishment

06:03.840 --> 06:13.760
of the mind. The mind is established properly. And understanding is a form of samadhi, which

06:13.760 --> 06:23.520
is why samatha and vipassana, again, preceded by the right view, not without view. There

06:23.520 --> 06:27.920
is no vipassana and there is no samatha. For somebody who has a right view, samatha

06:27.920 --> 06:34.920
and vipassana go hand in hand, inseparable. Because that's one big thing, people think,

06:34.920 --> 06:41.080
oh, there is a study, and then there is a form of meditation. Your study is your meditation

06:41.080 --> 06:46.080
if you do it right, and your meditation is your study if you do it right. Yes, sure,

06:46.080 --> 06:51.160
there is the aspect of gaining information, gaining knowledge, no doubt about that, but

06:51.160 --> 06:58.480
there is just preliminary. What exactly do you mean by a establishment of the mind? Well,

06:58.480 --> 07:04.120
if I try to explain the solution to a problem and you understand it, your mind is established

07:04.120 --> 07:12.600
upon that understanding. You gained that understanding. How is it different to a concentration? Well,

07:12.600 --> 07:17.960
it's not different. No, it requires concentration, but the concentration is misunderstood to

07:17.960 --> 07:25.160
be that which shuts things out, as opposed to that which includes all things in. And

07:25.160 --> 07:28.800
that's the other sort of where the Buddha gives a similar for man, first to keep an eye

07:28.800 --> 07:33.680
on, I don't know, 50 children. He can't chase all of them all the time. Because if he

07:33.680 --> 07:38.480
goes after one specifically, he loses the sight of all the others. So he has some wisdom,

07:38.480 --> 07:42.960
so he recognizes that and then he finds an elevated place in the yard where he can climb

07:42.960 --> 07:48.960
out. And then from there, see all children all the time, he wants, which means he keeps

07:48.960 --> 07:56.960
an eye on all of them by stepping back. And that's also for one point in this. Usually

07:56.960 --> 08:01.400
people think you're focused so hard until all the other children disappear and then you

08:01.400 --> 08:09.000
forget that you are supposed to take care of 29 children more, not just one. So you're

08:09.000 --> 08:15.240
keeping attention to the future, right? Okay. So that's why the Buddha said that the foundation

08:15.240 --> 08:20.040
of every practice of samadhi is mindfulness. Every jhana is underlined by mindfulness, like

08:20.040 --> 08:27.440
established by mindfulness. And that's mindfulness. So that this one has to have, must have the

08:27.440 --> 08:34.320
right view in order to attain jhana. No, not necessarily, but that's the thing. See,

08:34.320 --> 08:40.120
because the practice of jhana is along the right view, naturally, in its nature, which is

08:40.120 --> 08:45.120
why the Buddha praised it. Theoretically, it's possible to have jhana without having the

08:45.120 --> 08:51.600
right view, but you would have to never ever hear even a single stance of Buddhist teaching.

08:51.600 --> 08:57.200
Yeah. Why? Because it's really so close. So protrusion can get there. Theoretically,

08:57.200 --> 09:01.240
let's say somebody does have jhana's. He never had a bruise. For you, it would probably

09:01.240 --> 09:05.840
be enough depending on how established he is in his jhana's. Just one sentence, attaining

09:05.840 --> 09:10.120
to the essence of the dhamma. And he'll be coming out if not, if not, if not out of

09:10.120 --> 09:15.480
it all the way. Which were the cases in the sutras. Why? Because the minds were actually

09:15.480 --> 09:20.720
established. So all of the pollutions were cleared. They just needed the last tweak, the last

09:20.720 --> 09:28.160
kind of drop of dye that will color everything rightly. So, but today, it's quite unlikely

09:28.160 --> 09:33.120
that the person would have jhana's, and not be a sort of one, at least. Because, you

09:33.120 --> 09:36.920
know, like, again, if you talk about jhana's, means you have kind of cross Buddhist teaching

09:36.920 --> 09:41.000
means you have read. So, if you are actually developing jhana's, you will be developing

09:41.000 --> 09:45.560
your right understanding through that. That's why it's, it's off my level of what's the

09:45.560 --> 09:50.560
right meditation? Well, first of all, in some of the episodes, he said that every aspect

09:50.560 --> 09:55.120
of the right view is right because of the right view. So every, every aspect of the

09:55.120 --> 10:00.760
know-believe for puff is right because of the right view. So some samadhi is, is right

10:00.760 --> 10:06.960
because of samadhi. Everything is right because of samadhi. So, provide the person as the

10:06.960 --> 10:12.800
right view. What would be the right meditation for them? Establishing with mind through jhana's.

10:12.800 --> 10:21.080
What are the suckless jhana? It's establishment of mind. So, if you mind is established to

10:21.080 --> 10:31.960
such an extent, well, to a certain extent, for different. So, it's not, again, a famous

10:31.960 --> 10:36.200
son upon a satisuit, that the people teach meditation bringing you into jhana, you

10:36.200 --> 10:42.640
don't, not necessarily. You enter jhana if you know how to enter jhana. So, establish your

10:42.640 --> 10:49.080
mind in that way, if you know how to establish your mind in that way. Anapunasati never

10:49.080 --> 10:53.880
mentions jhana's. Anapunasati suit. It doesn't talk about jhana's, it talks about mindfulness.

10:53.880 --> 10:58.080
Practicing an anapunasati develops the fourth foundation. Mindfulness, fourth foundation,

10:58.080 --> 11:03.200
mindfulness develops the four powers, four powers develop the seven light and five

11:03.200 --> 11:08.720
practice, or something like that. Mind makes it up on time. But that's the point. There's

11:08.720 --> 11:15.200
no mention in jhana's, which is enough to undermine the kind of common perception that

11:15.200 --> 11:22.520
you automatically enter jhana through watching your breath. Then I get this experience, or

11:22.520 --> 11:26.720
something like that. Now, jhana's establishment of mind, and when the Buddha did talk about

11:26.720 --> 11:32.380
that, he listed all sorts of things you can use to establish your mind upon, and thus

11:32.380 --> 11:40.160
enter jhana. Anapunasati is just one of them, staring at a dead body, staring at decomposed

11:40.160 --> 11:47.720
bodies. Practicing anapunasati would, and then there was casinos. You can use casinos

11:47.720 --> 11:53.280
to establish your mind in jhana's, like the earth element, water, and various things.

11:53.280 --> 11:58.040
And then also, the sutras, whenever the sutras talk about the establishment of mind, there

11:58.040 --> 12:03.200
are jhana's, then there are those immaterial. They refer to immaterial jhana's, but they're

12:03.200 --> 12:07.520
actually immaterial establishments of mind. They're different kinds. Equally wholesome, like

12:07.520 --> 12:12.960
not exceptional perception, and infinite space, if you're conscious, and so on. Again,

12:12.960 --> 12:16.000
people assume that's like the extension of the four jhana's, or they're all in the

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
four jhana's, or those whatever. I kind of remember the commentaries, those schemes

12:20.000 --> 12:24.680
and divisions. Now, all of those are the establishments of mind, same like tank casinos,

12:24.680 --> 12:35.320
earth, water, fire, blue, yellow, red and white, and then infinite space and infinite

12:35.320 --> 12:43.920
consciousness. So, the Buddha talks about them, I think only one or two sutras, but in the

12:43.920 --> 12:49.640
same way, the key establishments is mind upon the earth element. He knows the extent of

12:49.640 --> 12:55.480
that. So, he recognizes that establishment, he's confident, because of that refined

12:55.480 --> 13:01.920
establishment, he abandons everything else that's inferior to that. And if you look, what's

13:01.920 --> 13:06.880
inferior to the element of earth, element of resistance, you know, what, everything.

13:06.880 --> 13:11.040
You know, everything, particularly in your experience, inferior to the establishment

13:11.040 --> 13:17.120
upon element of earth. Then, so, a person can do that, a photojournal can do that. But

13:17.120 --> 13:20.760
the Buddha prays it because it's still a great deal of wisdom. So, if somebody does that

13:20.760 --> 13:24.760
on their own, and then he has the dharma, they won't like it would be easy for them to

13:24.760 --> 13:29.600
really understand it. But then he also did the refer to it in the same sense as he referred

13:29.600 --> 13:33.480
to such a show. They're like, what's out there? People, if they don't make the effort,

13:33.480 --> 13:38.440
they don't see that there is beyond. So, they don't see the danger, the gratification

13:38.440 --> 13:42.920
and the escape in regard to a casino, which is usually the same thing he would use for

13:42.920 --> 13:47.840
a sensuality, the same way. The gratification, the danger of gratification and the escape.

13:47.840 --> 13:52.560
Then, the target sees that, and then he abandons it because of that. So, he goes establishable

13:52.560 --> 13:56.840
modifying casino, modifying casino, more. But you can use, you don't have to establish

13:56.840 --> 14:00.720
all of them. You can use any of them. You can establish yourself for any of them and

14:00.720 --> 14:05.640
then see this. So, that's a different way of looking at your establishment. But because

14:05.640 --> 14:11.720
establishment is wholesome, when you establish, then you see the danger, the gratification

14:11.720 --> 14:19.360
and escape in regard to that refined wholesome establishment of your mind, means you did

14:19.360 --> 14:25.040
purify your mind. Like, if you manage to abandon and let go of that refined thing, like

14:25.040 --> 14:30.000
what can be said for all those course unwholesome things, they just fall off never to return.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.360
So, he goes and he talks about, like, so the earth, water, fire, about every casino. But

14:36.360 --> 14:39.360
then he says, well, some of these people don't see the danger and they get it, the target

14:39.360 --> 14:44.800
that does. Which means seeing danger and escape. Danger gratification and escape in regard

14:44.800 --> 14:51.400
to any particular casino is the development of wisdom, which is a different thing. But

14:51.400 --> 14:54.920
then it wouldn't be there if you didn't establish your mind. So, through the establishment

14:54.920 --> 15:00.240
of your mind, you can see things particularly and then be completely free regardless of

15:00.240 --> 15:05.880
whether your mind continues to be established or not, which is what I want you to be.

15:05.880 --> 15:11.120
Then he goes to say about the consciousness casino, like the most refined casino of all

15:11.120 --> 15:17.080
and everybody, every salmon and brown, they agree on that. And then somebody might establish

15:17.080 --> 15:21.560
the mind upon that, the event of not just all of the inferior, but all the other casinos

15:21.560 --> 15:27.160
to establish upon the ultimate refinement of the mind and says, and then the target sees

15:27.160 --> 15:35.080
the danger, the gratification and escape in regard to that. So, the basis for wisdom

15:35.080 --> 15:40.440
should be basically the establishment of mind. If there is no basis for wisdom, the mind

15:40.440 --> 15:44.840
is not established properly. Sometimes you can have mind established properly, but then

15:44.840 --> 15:50.320
you don't know what to look for. So, you don't pursue that as basis for your wisdom.

15:50.320 --> 15:55.160
In that way, it's like Samadhi's necessity. You cannot not have a degree of your mind

15:55.160 --> 16:02.680
establishment and expect wisdom to arise. But then you cannot have right view and correct

16:02.680 --> 16:09.360
instructions and expect to wisdom to arise because you wouldn't know what to look for.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.880
You wouldn't know how to recognize danger, you wouldn't know how to discern gratification

16:13.880 --> 16:17.960
and you wouldn't know what escape is. Not knowing those things means the wisdom likes

16:17.960 --> 16:23.240
development. So, first John, I can be based for that second John, I can be based for that,

16:23.240 --> 16:28.760
any John, I can be based for that, any casino can be. So, there are certain right meditations

16:28.760 --> 16:33.880
in themselves, and none of them is actually right if there is no right view enabling them

16:33.880 --> 16:38.600
to act as basis for wisdom. And Buddha said that, without a right view, John is just pleasant

16:38.600 --> 16:45.400
by the here and now, nothing more. But it's developing wisdom in regard to that, that

16:45.400 --> 16:51.800
it's called, your basement, wasn't it? It was the basement, so that.

16:51.800 --> 16:58.440
So, concentration is a character, one of the characteristics of establishment of mind.

16:58.440 --> 17:04.280
Well, right concentration. Again, we'll be right only with the right view.

17:04.280 --> 17:17.480
Well, what the right view rises to two factors, the word of another, and the proper attention.

17:17.480 --> 17:24.480
The proper attention. But the thing that you've got to know with proper attention is, then

17:24.480 --> 17:29.600
so, and proper attention is, is the form of samadhi.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.960
Yeah, knowing how to establish your mind.

17:31.960 --> 17:35.000
That's why, for the right view, you like, you don't need genres or something, but you

17:35.000 --> 17:41.760
need to cheat a limiter. You need to have grasped the, the, the sign limiter of your mind,

17:41.760 --> 17:48.080
like the phenomenological appearance of your mind, which is there as a phenomenon, ambiguous

17:48.080 --> 17:52.720
for most people to not see it, because they're only used to, they only qualify as real what

17:52.720 --> 17:57.320
they experience to their senses. That's real, everything else is not real. So, when they

17:57.320 --> 18:02.320
deny their own thoughts as real things, how far you move they are from seeing that, like

18:02.320 --> 18:07.640
the subtle shape of your mind, the expanded mind, you know, this is the expanded mind.

18:07.640 --> 18:12.960
That's it. You don't go in more detail, because it's not more detailed. That's the detail

18:12.960 --> 18:19.560
it has. It's a loop. It's depressed. It's, it's contracted. It's expanded. It's, it's

18:19.560 --> 18:27.440
elated. It's not. It's general mood. Well, like, recognize your mind on those terms,

18:27.440 --> 18:31.760
on those ambiguous terms. Means grasping the signs that your mind shows you. Well, the

18:31.760 --> 18:38.200
side of the mind means the way it has appeared. Like a sign. Like, ah, you see the contours

18:38.200 --> 18:41.200
of something. Ah, you grasping the signs of it.

18:41.200 --> 18:50.360
They don't see it. They don't see it. People see you their mind that don't know it. Well,

18:50.360 --> 18:55.320
because how did you do that? Yeah, I mean, in a sense, it just really depends how we, how

18:55.320 --> 19:00.560
we choose to use the word because like, you have no choice but to have your mind there.

19:00.560 --> 19:03.960
So, it's not that, through not seeing their mind, the mind is not there. It's there. They

19:03.960 --> 19:12.280
just don't have a clue. They ignore it. Yeah, exact ignorant. So, are you seeing in

19:12.280 --> 19:16.240
terms of knowing it? No, they see the mind means they know the mind. They recognize

19:16.240 --> 19:33.000
the mind as such. So, would I be wrong or rather, would it be wrong to use the word focus?

19:33.000 --> 19:39.360
Yes, I would. You probably would. Yeah. Because focus just takes people out. Yeah. You

19:39.360 --> 19:44.840
get focused on something. Ah, well, you should get focused on something and then start

19:44.840 --> 19:52.920
looking at yourself being focused on something. That's the proper development of my thoughts.

19:52.920 --> 19:59.680
Focus yourself on something, if you want. But then develop notions of tokens, pick up

19:59.680 --> 20:08.160
the tokens of the phenomena of you being focused upon something right there. So, you get

20:08.160 --> 20:15.320
focused on something and then you see yourself being focused on something. And, and that's

20:15.320 --> 20:21.800
it. That's the beginning. That's the recognition. Well, that can lead to recognition. Basically,

20:21.800 --> 20:26.800
you need to recognize the principle of like, well, like peripheral vision. If you look

20:26.800 --> 20:33.760
at things directly, well, you don't see what's peripheral to it. So, you have to learn

20:33.760 --> 20:38.880
how to, which is what proper attention is, how to be able to start noticing things peripherally

20:38.880 --> 20:48.160
and more generally, without overretending them, without making them into actual direct, which

20:48.160 --> 20:51.040
removes the nature of peripheral, which means something else is in peripheral and you're

20:51.040 --> 20:56.360
not seeing it as an established phenomena. Because there is a domain of direct focused

20:56.360 --> 21:02.680
actually in front of you. Simultaneous to that, there's a domain of peripheral, a negative,

21:02.680 --> 21:10.520
a background, general, ambiguous. And, they both exist. They're both real, the sun in

21:10.520 --> 21:17.960
their own domain, yeah. So, for as long as you're using the tools, the assumptions of based

21:17.960 --> 21:23.200
upon actual indirect, you'll never be able to access peripheral in its own terms, which

21:23.200 --> 21:26.560
means it's on the main, which means you're not actually peripheral, you're just thinking

21:26.560 --> 21:31.400
about actual and then developing views about that. So, that's well a question of science,

21:31.400 --> 21:37.040
anything exact sciences which will require a focus, external measure, they're basically,

21:37.040 --> 21:42.840
well, self-defeating when it comes to practicing the dama, because they cannot in their nature

21:42.840 --> 21:52.840
pertain to the domain of peripheral. And we start off with being focused. Well, as long

21:52.840 --> 21:59.200
as you know, that's just one aspect of your experience. But the thing is, if you then,

21:59.200 --> 22:04.160
if you see yourself being focused, if you know what you're supposed to look, that the

22:04.160 --> 22:10.520
moment you see yourself doing anything, that will be a form of focus, you don't have

22:10.520 --> 22:16.800
to be specifically focusing yourself, of this object or that object. You have to establish

22:16.800 --> 22:22.200
sealer, so there is no unwholesome focus or any kind, then upon whatever you're focused

22:22.200 --> 22:28.240
at the time, you can see yourself being focused on that, because that's the point, that's

22:28.240 --> 22:31.880
how to develop mindfulness, not by choosing a magical focus or finding a magical object

22:31.880 --> 22:37.840
of your focus. So, in that sense, you should really make your effort to find out how to

22:37.840 --> 22:43.280
get established in that peripheral vision, because that will make you focused actually,

22:43.280 --> 22:49.720
directly, upon whatever, whatever is present. Which also means, your focus of any kind will

22:49.720 --> 22:56.280
not be dependent upon anything external, but it will be dependent upon your mindfulness,

22:56.280 --> 23:00.640
for which you're fully responsible, which you're in control of your own focus, whatever

23:00.640 --> 23:05.640
you mind, you're controlled wherever you mind goes, through that mindfulness, through that

23:05.640 --> 23:08.640
base of mindfulness.

23:08.640 --> 23:24.600
So, going back to that example, you came up with that, so you look after the 50-year-round,

23:24.600 --> 23:29.960
but you're not trying to connect to the 50-year-round. No, that's not looking after exactly,

23:29.960 --> 23:32.960
because while you are connecting, means you're losing sight of the other, because you can't

23:32.960 --> 23:37.760
connect to all of them at once. That's like recognizing the importance from unimportant.

23:37.760 --> 23:43.960
No, the point is to keep an eye on that, focus on that, you keep an eye on that.

23:43.960 --> 23:52.160
You also keep an eye on that, you also keep an eye on that, but not do you, do you, do

23:52.160 --> 23:58.000
you know, some of the getting some of the falls case, or it's crying, but you're just

23:58.000 --> 24:03.560
getting lost. That's kind of extending the simile, but no, the simile just refers to the

24:03.560 --> 24:08.200
actual practice of samadhi, which you can see, it's completely founded upon mindfulness.

24:08.200 --> 24:13.360
So, rather than thinking of concentration and focus, if you want to think about samadhi,

24:13.360 --> 24:20.600
even in a particular term, you should think in terms of unwavering mindfulness. When

24:20.600 --> 24:31.240
you're so mindful, that you are not unmindful, means you are established with samadhi.

24:31.240 --> 24:38.960
So then you say, you have to actually make the effort to realize to understand what mindfulness

24:38.960 --> 24:44.440
is. Exactly. And through understanding mindfulness, then you will develop that mindfulness. It's

24:44.440 --> 24:48.320
not like one thing that, no, it's through that understanding, you will develop mindfulness,

24:48.320 --> 24:54.640
you will be mindful. That's how the whole dhamma works. Like if you were to understand

24:54.640 --> 25:01.800
what arantipis, you will be on a way to become an arantipis, if not the arantipis. So you

25:01.800 --> 25:09.440
can't entertain the notions of thinking you know what arantipis and what dhammas and

25:09.440 --> 25:21.160
meditation is, and at the same time, they'll teach you how to do it.

25:21.160 --> 25:34.840
Remember, when I was practicing, I like to turn to general awareness, it relates to

25:34.840 --> 25:41.840
how I was working in the shop and I was doing this in general when I was trying to be mindful

25:41.840 --> 25:52.840
and I was doing that. You lost the sight of what was going to be for you to talk to me.

25:52.840 --> 25:58.360
Yeah. That's kind of. Exactly. Exactly. It means you were so concerned about keeping

25:58.360 --> 26:02.840
around 50 children, you started thinking about about 50 children and lost sight of them.

26:02.840 --> 26:08.360
They were right in front of you. So you can't, you can't have disconnected from whatever,

26:08.360 --> 26:14.920
which is why like the Buddha refers to mindfulness of the body and bodily postures, because that's

26:14.920 --> 26:19.360
always the anchor right there in the actual touch of your senses. So it's always in the

26:19.360 --> 26:23.440
relation to that. So yeah, oh 50 children, what if I lose them, what if I lose them,

26:23.440 --> 26:26.680
and by getting caught up in thinking like that and being really considered not to lose

26:26.680 --> 26:35.680
them, you start noticing them. They're right off. Because if you've got the body posture

26:35.680 --> 26:44.680
and the general awareness, not just focused on the body posture, solely on that or focused,

26:44.680 --> 26:52.680
solely on general awareness, but I mean both of those, that is where you've, that is

26:52.680 --> 26:59.680
the, it's the occult, it's a principle of symphony, yeah. You can't, so you can't find

26:59.680 --> 27:04.680
it. You focus on something, looking at the spine, looking at your breath, seeing that

27:04.680 --> 27:09.680
doesn't be a good lesson on the nature. Yeah. We want to, we want to see that. Yeah,

27:09.680 --> 27:14.680
Nietzsche is undermining, like the premise that undermines whatever you're established

27:14.680 --> 27:21.680
upon. So it's exactly that. Say general awareness in the present body, like you wouldn't be

27:21.680 --> 27:26.680
generally aware if your body is not alive there, if your organs are not still operating.

27:26.680 --> 27:30.680
It's the view that undermines in this side of the notion. Yeah, if you take your,

27:30.680 --> 27:36.680
now your opinion of opinion, now your opinion of mutual understanding itself, each other.

27:36.680 --> 27:43.680
So, if you, if you, if you're, if you're taking up now your opinion, you want to

27:43.680 --> 27:51.680
deperminance by seeing independence simultaneously while you are still holding it. Up on Vinyana, if

27:51.680 --> 27:54.680
you take Vinyana, you see it simultaneously depends upon number Rupa. So it's either

27:54.680 --> 27:58.680
there is no in between or left or right where you can step aside and then look at

27:58.680 --> 28:04.680
both. So either this is determined by number Rupa, Vinyana or it's Vinyana,

28:04.680 --> 28:10.680
determined by number Rupa. That's your experience, always, one or the other. So

28:10.680 --> 28:15.680
by recognizing this general in the particular actual body, you will be stopped, like

28:15.680 --> 28:19.680
not knowingly in the beginning, but you will be ambit in those principles. And

28:19.680 --> 28:26.680
actually you can even continue the reflection as I just started saying, you

28:26.680 --> 28:31.680
wouldn't be aware of anything, no matter how general particular, if your body is not

28:31.680 --> 28:36.680
alive here. Like the organs that you have no control over, your heart, your eyes,

28:36.680 --> 28:40.680
if they're not there functioning, just your awareness will be inconceivable. You

28:40.680 --> 28:45.680
wouldn't be able to think. At the same time, if there is no thinking with any kind,

28:45.680 --> 28:50.680
you wouldn't know those organs as organs. You wouldn't know anything as anything.

28:50.680 --> 28:56.680
It's just inconceivable. Things without a name are inconceivable. That's number Rupa.

28:56.680 --> 29:00.680
Like you can't have just a Rupa, pure enough. You only can have a name of the Rupa.

29:00.680 --> 29:11.680
Yeah, you would say it's the old and appears. But the reason why appears is because

29:11.680 --> 29:16.680
consciousness is out there with the Rupa. So in that, but that's a different topic.

29:16.680 --> 29:22.680
The point is, you can see your day-to-day mindfulness is fully dependent upon

29:22.680 --> 29:27.680
like random organs of your living body operating in the function that you

29:27.680 --> 29:32.680
cannot control. If that changes, you're dead. And they will change.

29:32.680 --> 29:38.680
So at the same time, you are mindful generally and you're mindful of the very

29:38.680 --> 29:45.680
like underlying foundations of your own existence. You realize, well, whatever I do,

29:45.680 --> 29:50.680
mindful, you're unmindful, aware of unaware, it's fully determined by these

29:50.680 --> 29:55.680
random organs that I'm no control over. Then you must start thinking about

29:55.680 --> 29:59.680
your random organs as more fundamental. But then it goes, well, that's just my

29:59.680 --> 30:04.680
thought of that, which a random organ is. So that's your name, which means

30:04.680 --> 30:09.680
random organ would be inconceivable if there is no, even a degree of forgiveness in

30:09.680 --> 30:14.680
regard to that. If the name of an organ doesn't appear, if that it doesn't appear

30:14.680 --> 30:21.680
in experience as anything, if something doesn't appear, you can't even conceive it.

30:21.680 --> 30:27.680
So that's enough to show you that, well, these random organs operate, but they

30:27.680 --> 30:31.680
wouldn't be operating if there is no consciousness in regard to them, if there is

30:31.680 --> 30:36.680
no awareness in regard to them. So I mean by that, even the living heart

30:36.680 --> 30:40.680
would not be living heart, if there is no consciousness associated with the

30:40.680 --> 30:45.680
body as a unit. So in that sense, you start recognizing the consciousness is

30:45.680 --> 30:51.680
on the level of those random organs outside, that below the threshold that you can

30:51.680 --> 30:57.680
see or receive 20 cents. It's the foundation of your senses. So it's not in

30:57.680 --> 31:01.680
your head or inside the viewer on this side, and then Rupa is on that side.

31:01.680 --> 31:08.680
Rupa and Vinyana are out there, and the kind of result of that is Nama, Rupa

31:08.680 --> 31:15.680
and Vinyana. But that's what meant before when I said, well,

31:15.680 --> 31:20.680
whatever you think is your thought, or presentation, or phenomenon, or

31:20.680 --> 31:25.680
dama, whatever we want to translate it. And that's all you can ever have in

31:25.680 --> 31:28.680
regard to different things, but even you say different things that's another

31:28.680 --> 31:32.680
thought. So you can never step outside of your mind and say, this is the real

31:32.680 --> 31:36.680
thing. No, the real thing is not only because your mind knows it as such.

31:36.680 --> 31:41.680
That's the priority of the mind. The first, the first verse of Tampa,

31:41.680 --> 31:46.680
mind is the forerunner of all things. It's structural forerunner.

31:46.680 --> 31:52.680
It was being concealed. So when you talk about Rupa or any other

31:52.680 --> 31:59.680
aggregate, you're talking through your mind. So to speak, in other words,

31:59.680 --> 32:02.680
you have to know that when you say Rupa and you say this, we say that

32:02.680 --> 32:09.680
that cannot stand for the actual elements. Assuming that it does stand means

32:09.680 --> 32:13.680
you conceive those elements in your thoughts. Your thoughts are

32:13.680 --> 32:18.680
conceiving. And that's exactly Mula Porya. Assuming the discrepancy of any

32:18.680 --> 32:26.680
kind means you give them existence in your thoughts. So the, like the

32:26.680 --> 32:29.680
you know, the five core, the mastering your thoughts and the one who

32:29.680 --> 32:34.680
he's thought altogether, he's another. The danger there is, when you say

32:34.680 --> 32:38.680
thoughts, people think abstract kind of theoretical proliferating.

32:38.680 --> 32:42.680
But not looking at the door is a thought experience as well.

32:42.680 --> 32:46.680
Now another danger is becoming like falling into solipsism and they're all

32:46.680 --> 32:50.680
telling my head. Well, a thought that things are in your head is another

32:50.680 --> 32:53.680
thought that it's present and that cannot be in your head. So a thought

32:53.680 --> 32:58.680
that my head, the space, this opposite, that's all again, a phenomenon

32:58.680 --> 33:01.680
that has a reason on the level of the mind, which is where things arise.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.680
And within that, you can distinguish different types of phenomena, but they

33:05.680 --> 33:09.680
all have things in common, which is, they share the same nature of

33:09.680 --> 33:14.680
appearing, manifesting. And on that level, they're all phenomena. They're

33:14.680 --> 33:17.680
all phenomenological, which is what they're all dumb. Like all of the

33:17.680 --> 33:23.680
aggregates are dumb. And some cars. Not the same time, obviously, but

33:23.680 --> 33:27.680
they serve as that which determines and that which determines depending

33:27.680 --> 33:32.680
on where your attention is. You can't step outside of it.

33:32.680 --> 33:36.680
That's what I said in our opinion. It's always either of them.

33:36.680 --> 33:43.680
So every experience is by the number of phenomena, either two

33:43.680 --> 33:46.680
convenience, like two of them being combined or three of them.

33:46.680 --> 33:49.680
No, every experience, no, no, no, every experience, depending again on

33:49.680 --> 33:53.680
the approach, but in this sense, every experience is either founded

33:53.680 --> 33:58.680
or the number of phenomena. And by that, I'm determined by it.

33:58.680 --> 34:03.680
As far as you can. You can't have the number of phenomena

34:03.680 --> 34:07.680
that you call in front of you. You will be one of them, which means

34:07.680 --> 34:13.680
the other one can be, if seen correctly, can be the...

34:13.680 --> 34:20.680
The undermining factor that will remove your sense of self.

34:20.680 --> 34:25.680
If you see that my sense of self depends upon that which right now,

34:25.680 --> 34:30.680
while I'm holding this is me, depends fully upon that which is me.

34:30.680 --> 34:34.680
And actually, I just gave you the example, rather generally,

34:34.680 --> 34:41.680
but it's a good start. Your organs, your bodily organs.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.680
Like you have to bring down, you have to recognize the connection

34:45.680 --> 34:50.680
between the presence of a random working heart and your entire life.

34:50.680 --> 34:57.680
And literally, working heart is like an object, how they're in the world.

34:57.680 --> 35:02.680
But it's an object because of which the object exists as phenomena.

35:02.680 --> 35:06.680
So it's a particular type of object that enables your experience as such

35:06.680 --> 35:09.680
because it's paired with consciousness, matter and consciousness.

35:09.680 --> 35:13.680
But none of which you can actually access or have any...

35:13.680 --> 35:16.680
Sorry, control or input over.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.680
There are three beyond outside of your reach.

35:19.680 --> 35:25.680
So all you're going to have is a presentation or their appearance in a way.

35:25.680 --> 35:28.680
So you can know the direction they appear from.

35:28.680 --> 35:31.680
But you can't call them. You can't get, because if you would,

35:31.680 --> 35:35.680
I don't, you will not be possible.

35:35.680 --> 35:42.680
So if the fundamentals, if the foundations of your experience,

35:42.680 --> 35:45.680
would generally be within your reach,

35:45.680 --> 35:48.680
there would be a self, there would be a creator,

35:48.680 --> 35:51.680
there would be a person that you can take the ownership of.

35:51.680 --> 35:56.680
But there aren't, which is why the sense of self,

35:56.680 --> 36:00.680
whatever else, it's completely unnecessary.

36:00.680 --> 36:05.680
It's a parasite, it's not, it can't be there.

36:05.680 --> 36:10.680
But not knowing that it can't be there, it's there.

36:10.680 --> 36:14.680
There is no room for a vigil in the five aggregates.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.680
Not knowing that there is no room for a vigil,

36:17.680 --> 36:19.680
not fully understanding what that means.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.680
You make the room.

36:22.680 --> 36:43.680
I must, yeah, it's not like, it's not exactly an easy method.

36:52.680 --> 37:03.680
So the good, the good way to start is when you,

37:03.680 --> 37:07.680
when you take up a contemplation,

37:07.680 --> 37:10.680
you need a soup turn of five aggregates and unconscious and stuff,

37:10.680 --> 37:14.680
instead of trying to figure out what it all is,

37:14.680 --> 37:18.680
start by undoing what you think it all is.

37:18.680 --> 37:22.680
In other words, the word that talks about Nala or Nala,

37:22.680 --> 37:24.680
say Nama Rupa, Nya Nama Rupa is okay, so Nama Rupa,

37:24.680 --> 37:27.680
well, before you can understand that,

37:27.680 --> 37:31.680
first, you have to purify what Nama Rupa designation stands for

37:31.680 --> 37:33.680
in your experience.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.680
What consciousness stands for in your experience?

37:35.680 --> 37:38.680
So if you were to take up five aggregates and name them,

37:38.680 --> 37:40.680
in English or Sinhala or whatever,

37:40.680 --> 37:43.680
just repeat the name two or three times.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.680
Do you know at that time,

37:46.680 --> 37:49.680
what that matter stands for in your experience when you say,

37:49.680 --> 37:53.680
ah, matter, and see directly what that matter is?

37:53.680 --> 37:55.680
And you realize you don't.

37:55.680 --> 37:59.680
You take all of them and you realize you do use them.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.680
You do have some general notion of what they are,

38:02.680 --> 38:05.680
what they pretend to, but you don't actually understand what they are.

38:05.680 --> 38:08.680
So you realize the practice is completely the opposite direction,

38:08.680 --> 38:10.680
you'll be naming it.

38:10.680 --> 38:11.680
So I'm trying to figure it all out,

38:11.680 --> 38:15.680
you have to undo it to the extent necessary when the recognition

38:15.680 --> 38:17.680
of what they are takes place,

38:17.680 --> 38:21.680
based on the external instruction laid down by the Buddha.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.680
Yes, that's right actually.

38:23.680 --> 38:24.680
You have a lot of time,

38:24.680 --> 38:27.680
I'll just say some stuff like,

38:27.680 --> 38:29.680
you say, five aggregates,

38:29.680 --> 38:32.680
I tried to reach five years and I'm lost.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.680
So now I'm trying to, you know, get them back.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.680
So you take them, you can't change the road.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.680
So take them as they are,

38:39.680 --> 38:41.680
Rupa Veduna,

38:41.680 --> 38:43.680
Sinus and Kalabinyana.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.680
And literally just a matter and then ponder.

38:46.680 --> 38:49.680
What is that matter?

38:49.680 --> 38:52.680
How would you describe it even in your own terms?

38:52.680 --> 38:56.680
Do you see that which matter is in your experience

38:56.680 --> 39:00.680
when you make after designation matter?

39:00.680 --> 39:02.680
Same for the feelings, same for the perceptions,

39:02.680 --> 39:05.680
same for the intentions, same for the conscience?

39:05.680 --> 39:07.680
You said to keep drilling in what,

39:07.680 --> 39:10.680
as opposed to building up artworks.

39:10.680 --> 39:17.680
So in the sense of how to make it vividly relatable.

39:17.680 --> 39:22.680
Well, you have to make it clean, accurate,

39:22.680 --> 39:24.680
in a sense whereby when you read the Sutta,

39:24.680 --> 39:26.680
when you read the five aggregates,

39:26.680 --> 39:28.680
you immediately see what that is in your experience.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.680
You have to stop and think about it

39:30.680 --> 39:32.680
and bring your life back to you.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.680
So you have to make it vividly relatable.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.680
Well, you have to make it clean, accurate,

39:37.680 --> 39:39.680
in a sense whereby when you read the Sutta,

39:39.680 --> 39:42.680
you can bring evoke the memory of what you thought was.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.680
Which is why how people became arrangements

39:44.680 --> 39:46.680
just by listening to Buddha once.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.680
Then you exactly what he was talking about.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.680
They didn't know the time,

39:50.680 --> 39:51.680
but when he was speaking,

39:51.680 --> 39:54.680
what he was referring to at the time.

39:54.680 --> 39:56.680
So by seeing those things,

39:56.680 --> 40:01.680
they are at the arrangement and full understanding.

40:01.680 --> 40:04.680
So the reason why we don't become arrangements now

40:04.680 --> 40:07.680
when you read the Sutta is because the terms that you read,

40:07.680 --> 40:09.680
you hold completely wrongly.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.680
So they don't actually pertain to that,

40:12.680 --> 40:14.680
which they actually are.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.680
If they would,

40:16.680 --> 40:18.680
you would arrive with understanding, inevitable.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.680
That's why corrective practice in Dhamma

40:20.680 --> 40:23.680
has to result.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.680
Well, it has to have the result.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.680
You can't be corrective practicing

40:28.680 --> 40:30.680
and not arriving anywhere.

40:30.680 --> 40:31.680
It just doesn't work.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.680
So if somebody tells you

40:33.680 --> 40:35.680
you have been practicing Dhamma 40 years,

40:35.680 --> 40:37.680
but it's not about becoming Sutta

40:37.680 --> 40:38.680
on the staff,

40:38.680 --> 40:39.680
you turn away that moment

40:39.680 --> 40:41.680
and don't listen to what they say.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.680
Because actually,

40:42.680 --> 40:44.680
if somebody has been practicing

40:44.680 --> 40:46.680
50, 40, 50, 60 years,

40:46.680 --> 40:48.680
and not even get the right view,

40:48.680 --> 40:52.680
it means they will be wasting the time for 60 years.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.680
So rather than presenting that as some sort of skill,

40:55.680 --> 40:57.680
as some sort of great achievement,

40:57.680 --> 40:59.680
should be embarrassed.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.680
And as the child said,

41:00.680 --> 41:01.680
the same,

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
if you're not Sutta

41:02.680 --> 41:05.680
for the first five years,

41:05.680 --> 41:07.680
it means you're wasting your time.

41:07.680 --> 41:08.680
And people are not

41:08.680 --> 41:09.680
because they misdirect the effort,

41:09.680 --> 41:11.680
so they don't have enough effort,

41:11.680 --> 41:12.680
so they don't bother

41:12.680 --> 41:14.680
in the first place or whatever.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.680
So again,

41:15.680 --> 41:17.680
it all comes back to

41:17.680 --> 41:18.680
that self-transparency,

41:18.680 --> 41:19.680
like knowing for yourself.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.680
Having that as a goal,

41:20.680 --> 41:21.680
there's a reason

41:21.680 --> 41:22.680
the Buddha laid it down

41:22.680 --> 41:23.680
and explained it,

41:23.680 --> 41:25.680
and encouraged amongst the country.

41:25.680 --> 41:26.680
If you were to understand

41:26.680 --> 41:27.680
what Sutta part is,

41:27.680 --> 41:29.680
you'll be a Sutta one.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.680
If you were to understand

41:30.680 --> 41:32.680
the freedom from three first feathers is,

41:32.680 --> 41:35.680
you'll be free from the three first feathers.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.680
There is no discrepancy

41:37.680 --> 41:38.680
to an understanding

41:38.680 --> 41:39.680
and then actually,

41:39.680 --> 41:40.680
the reality.

41:40.680 --> 41:41.680
You know, understanding is

41:41.680 --> 41:42.680
the reality.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.680
Obviously needs to be developed

41:44.680 --> 41:46.680
to extend necessary,

41:46.680 --> 41:47.680
and then you can start

41:47.680 --> 41:49.680
fully understood.

41:49.680 --> 41:50.680
You see,

41:50.680 --> 41:51.680
now you can't separate

41:51.680 --> 41:52.680
five languages.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.680
You can't separate them.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.680
No.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.680
No, change the order

41:55.680 --> 41:56.680
or look at the individual.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.680
You can individually

41:59.680 --> 42:02.680
be reviewing your designations

42:02.680 --> 42:04.680
of what you assume

42:04.680 --> 42:06.680
the five aggregate are.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.680
But even that should be done in the order.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.680
It's not a matter.

42:10.680 --> 42:20.680
And feeling in regard to the matter.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.680
And perception in regard to the matter.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.680
And your intentions in regard to the matter.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.680
Because you're not.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.680
There but you think consciousness

42:28.680 --> 42:30.680
is in regard to the matter.

42:30.680 --> 42:31.680
Okay.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.680
In regard to the matter.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.680
You don't lose the sight of the matter.

42:35.680 --> 42:36.680
Exactly.

42:36.680 --> 42:37.680
That's how you keep the order.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.680
That's how you affect them all.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.680
Try to understand the consciousness.

42:42.680 --> 42:43.680
Yeah.

42:43.680 --> 42:44.680
Because if you just take up consciousness

42:44.680 --> 42:45.680
randomly,

42:45.680 --> 42:46.680
I mean, are you just assuming it now?

42:46.680 --> 42:47.680
Again, through your own assumption,

42:47.680 --> 42:49.680
the consciousness can stand randomly

42:49.680 --> 42:52.680
independent of anything else.

42:52.680 --> 42:53.680
You can't.

42:53.680 --> 42:54.680
None of them can,

42:54.680 --> 42:55.680
which is why it's always,

42:55.680 --> 42:56.680
they're five heaps.

42:56.680 --> 42:57.680
They're five aggregates,

42:57.680 --> 43:00.680
not two and three.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.680
You can single out one of them

43:02.680 --> 43:05.680
while all of them are present.

43:05.680 --> 43:06.680
So on the basis of all of them,

43:06.680 --> 43:07.680
you can append one

43:07.680 --> 43:09.680
with the other more particular.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.680
Which is what you...

43:11.680 --> 43:15.680
You are taking one of them.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.680
So one of them are all of them.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.680
And that's another thing

43:27.680 --> 43:28.680
you should start thinking.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.680
You say five aggregates,

43:29.680 --> 43:32.680
it's not somewhere else.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.680
Try to run out while we speak your experience.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.680
That's what five aggregates are.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.680
So instead of trying to think about what they might be,

43:39.680 --> 43:41.680
you start looking

43:41.680 --> 43:43.680
in the general experience

43:43.680 --> 43:45.680
that you're mindful of right now,

43:45.680 --> 43:48.680
and discerning within that.

43:48.680 --> 43:49.680
Because they're there.

43:49.680 --> 43:52.680
So if you forget that they're right here right now

43:52.680 --> 43:54.680
and go looking for them,

43:54.680 --> 43:56.680
even if you find something,

43:56.680 --> 43:57.680
that's something you'll not be there

43:57.680 --> 43:59.680
because of which you started looking in the first place.

43:59.680 --> 44:06.680
Because it was right there.

44:06.680 --> 44:07.680
So that's what I mean.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.680
Like, oh, you start reviewing.

44:09.680 --> 44:11.680
You start basically learning how to discern

44:11.680 --> 44:12.680
because you know,

44:12.680 --> 44:14.680
you were told you have faith enough.

44:14.680 --> 44:17.680
Did your experience as a whole?

44:17.680 --> 44:19.680
Actually, peripheral,

44:19.680 --> 44:20.680
whatever else,

44:20.680 --> 44:21.680
whatever other approach you did,

44:21.680 --> 44:24.680
it's present right here right now.

44:24.680 --> 44:25.680
All of them,

44:25.680 --> 44:27.680
your experience is the five aggregates.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.680
Any experience you had,

44:29.680 --> 44:30.680
any experience you have,

44:30.680 --> 44:32.680
will be the five aggregates.

44:32.680 --> 44:33.680
And with a set of them,

44:33.680 --> 44:34.680
in some way they recall

44:34.680 --> 44:35.680
five lifestyles,

44:35.680 --> 44:36.680
five lifestyles,

44:36.680 --> 44:37.680
500 lifestyles,

44:37.680 --> 44:39.680
but they'll recall

44:39.680 --> 44:40.680
if these five aggregates

44:40.680 --> 44:42.680
are one specifically among them.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.680
But that's it.

44:43.680 --> 44:49.680
It's all within that.

44:49.680 --> 44:51.680
So you start training yourself

44:51.680 --> 44:52.680
how to discern them

44:52.680 --> 44:54.680
within this mindful picture

44:54.680 --> 44:56.680
that you established upon.

44:56.680 --> 44:57.680
Now,

44:57.680 --> 44:58.680
we already know

44:58.680 --> 44:59.680
who they are.

44:59.680 --> 45:00.680
あぁ

45:00.680 --> 45:02.680
Have you tried to discern

45:02.680 --> 45:05.680
that you were given

45:05.680 --> 45:06.680
out of the four levels of frequency?

45:06.680 --> 45:07.680
Oh,

45:07.680 --> 45:08.680
whatever you heard elektronik
