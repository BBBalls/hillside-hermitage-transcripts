00:00.000 --> 00:29.280
So can you describe the four Noble Truths and the Buddha's teachers, suffering is the

00:29.280 --> 00:35.200
first number, because there is suffering. Second, there is the cause of suffering. Third,

00:35.200 --> 00:39.680
cessation of suffering and fourth, and path, the cessation of suffering.

00:40.960 --> 00:50.400
Well, first and foremost, there are four descriptions or four aspects of one insight.

00:51.280 --> 00:57.120
That insight being freed from suffering, basically. A few free from suffering,

00:57.120 --> 01:02.800
then already implies the knowledge of what suffering is, that already implies the knowledge of

01:02.800 --> 01:07.600
what has been causing that suffering, that already implies the knowledge of freedom of suffering,

01:07.600 --> 01:11.760
and that already implies knowledge how to maintain that freedom from suffering, that insight.

01:15.920 --> 01:21.360
Well, how to develop it? Well, okay, yeah, how to maintain, which we basically then result in a

01:21.360 --> 01:26.720
complete liberation from all the upperclass and all the other kind of solutions.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.400
So it's not like one, two, three, four, that a person needs to discern one by one.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.320
It's basically suffering and freedom from it.

01:41.760 --> 01:46.480
And that's what, you know, in many sources, it's mentioned basically, it would be only,

01:46.480 --> 01:51.840
it would only be talked about, about the cause of suffering. And cause of suffering is,

01:53.520 --> 01:59.200
nothing else except craving. And that's, again, that's something that

02:01.200 --> 02:05.920
the people might read over, and then maybe you just like seem like it's, oh, it's making sense

02:05.920 --> 02:11.520
of course, but actually, in terms of the direct insight, seeing the craving is suffering

02:11.520 --> 02:18.160
results in liberation from that suffering. Seeing the craving means abandoning the craving.

02:18.160 --> 02:22.240
The only reason you crave is because you don't really see it directly, you don't understand it,

02:22.240 --> 02:30.880
you haven't discern it. And, yeah, the burden, I suppose, is to recognize that whenever

02:30.880 --> 02:39.920
there is suffering present, you can then say, you can reduce correctly that the craving must

02:39.920 --> 02:46.880
be present because the suffering is there. So it's not, oh, I suffer, now I have to look for the

02:46.880 --> 02:52.640
reason, call it craving or something else, or also assuming that sometimes something else can

02:52.640 --> 02:58.000
be the cause of your suffering. Really needs to be brought on so narrowly and so precisely,

02:58.960 --> 03:04.240
whereby you discern when the suffering, the disagreeable unpleasant feeling that you're

03:04.240 --> 03:08.960
resisting basically, when the suffering is present, means it because simultaneously with it,

03:08.960 --> 03:14.560
there is craving present. The absence of that craving, simultaneously means the absence of

03:14.560 --> 03:20.160
that suffering. There is no delay. That's why you can have the direct knowledge of freedom from

03:20.160 --> 03:26.560
suffering directly verified for yourself. Oh, you cannot suffer and meet suffering as the

03:26.560 --> 03:32.720
Buddha would often say. Literally, amidst things that used to make you suffer, the mind cannot

03:32.720 --> 03:42.240
suffer now because there is no more craving in regard to those things. How to abandon craving?

03:43.680 --> 03:52.160
How to abandon craving? Well, sensory strength, virtue, developed to the extent necessary,

03:52.880 --> 03:57.680
whereby you start discerning then your mental intentions, whether they're rooted in

03:57.680 --> 04:03.040
wholesome and wholesome, whether they're rooted in greed, aversion, delusion. And when you know

04:03.040 --> 04:07.440
that they are, you do not engage in them. You do not tolerate them, you do not entertain them,

04:07.440 --> 04:14.080
you do not proliferate, you do not invest in them. That would basically enable the mind to then

04:14.080 --> 04:22.480
not resist the unpleasant feeling, to not indulge the pleasant feeling, to not try to distract

04:22.480 --> 04:28.960
yourself from a neutral feeling. And when the mind stops doing that, with the previous knowledge that

04:29.680 --> 04:34.720
it has heard from outside through the sutras and the right teaching, when the mind stops doing that

04:34.720 --> 04:39.920
with the previous knowledge of what craving is, you'll be able to see, ah, this is the absence of

04:39.920 --> 04:46.800
craving. And you will be able to see right there, ah, there is no suffering. And then you will

04:46.800 --> 04:52.240
also be able to understand what that suffering was, even the suffering of the past, before he

04:52.240 --> 04:57.200
understood the way out. He wouldn't be suffering on account of that either. The same knowledge will

04:57.200 --> 05:01.360
be applied to the present, past and the future.

05:01.360 --> 05:20.800
So then how to endure those painful feelings? Do you have them now? Painful feelings, cravings, how do you?

05:22.080 --> 05:26.800
Well, you endure them basically, if instead of enduring, you want to give into centrality,

05:26.800 --> 05:32.320
or you want to give into a will, or distraction, while you don't do that, then that will result in

05:32.320 --> 05:38.720
you having to endure them. But sometimes if, ah, you can sort of, you don't have to endure them,

05:38.720 --> 05:43.600
without having to give into centrality, aversion, or delusion, then that's fine as well.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.400
So you don't have to just constantly going looking for pain to endure. They've been not necessarily

05:48.400 --> 06:06.160
resultant wisdom. How does one know that you're free from craving? How do you know that you?

06:06.160 --> 06:12.640
Because there's no suffering, I mean suffering. There's no suffering because you cannot suffer,

06:12.640 --> 06:18.400
not because you're hiding away from it, or because you're not, you're just avoiding things that

06:18.400 --> 06:22.480
would use to, they would use, they used to cause you to suffer. Because like avoiding things means

06:22.480 --> 06:28.080
you're afraid of something already. Like say, I don't know, a person doesn't leave their

06:28.080 --> 06:32.560
cutie because they don't want to talk to anyone because he might annoy them and they'll suffer.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.920
So they're not free from suffering. They're just protecting their precarious environment,

06:37.040 --> 06:41.280
often on disturbance. But the fact that you must protect it means you're disturbed by that,

06:41.280 --> 06:46.720
which means they're not truly not suffering. They're just hiding away from the greater extent of it.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.920
So you want to record, that's why like a conscious monkey doesn't neglect his duty.

06:51.920 --> 06:57.280
Like certain things that you must do, they are not necessarily connected just to sitting in a

06:57.280 --> 07:02.880
solitude and practicing, you know. Like here, we live by ourselves, we do things ourselves,

07:02.880 --> 07:07.520
so we, you know, we have to go and fix the waterline. I have to go and patch my thing. I mean,

07:07.520 --> 07:15.040
I don't have to, but then I won't have any water. But having to do that doesn't bother you either.

07:15.040 --> 07:20.080
You're not seeking out as a distraction, but you're not running away from it when it arises on

07:20.080 --> 07:23.440
its own as something that's necessary to be done to sustain the way you live it.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.320
So you need to have, again, that self honesty, so you know you're not hiding away, you're not

07:32.320 --> 07:37.520
indulging, you're not covering anything up. With that self honesty and all the restraint of the

07:37.520 --> 07:42.160
senses, seeing the danger in the slightest fault, moderation in eating, the result just in

07:42.160 --> 07:47.200
obviously being mindful of your actions. You start discerning mental intentions,

07:48.080 --> 07:52.560
by discerning them basically, the mind is already developing a certain perspective because

07:52.560 --> 07:58.720
there is no craving without intention, but there is intention without craving. That's why our

07:58.720 --> 08:05.280
hunt can still intend and decide and choose, but he has no craving. But in order to see that,

08:06.160 --> 08:10.240
you have to see the intentions to begin with. Most people are not even aware of the mental

08:10.240 --> 08:15.520
intentions. They think intention is just the most obvious choice, but it's not. It's just

08:15.520 --> 08:22.560
little inclinations, thoughts in themselves are already intentional. So it's subtle, and in order

08:22.560 --> 08:28.800
to reach a subtle level, this whole sensory restraint, restrained by the party mocha, by the virtue,

08:28.800 --> 08:32.560
moderation eating, mindfulness is not, it's absolutely necessary, it's not negotiable.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.920
And with the right instruction and the right way of looking, that's where the practice is.

08:38.800 --> 08:43.680
With the other right instruction, it is just restraint, which is good, but it doesn't lead you

08:43.680 --> 08:47.360
to any knowledge. But with the right instruction and that, that's all you need.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.880
Because sometimes people might think, okay, the restraint is not the dama, that's true.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.040
And then they would think, okay, well, now I got the dama, so I don't have to restrain, no.

08:57.040 --> 09:05.200
Like dama applies only where the restraint is. So you can see, yeah, restraint is not the dama,

09:05.200 --> 09:10.640
as in the application of the dama, is not the same as the necessary basis for that application,

09:10.640 --> 09:18.800
but you wouldn't be able to apply it if there is no necessary basis. And if the mind practices

09:18.800 --> 09:27.520
like that, then the inclination in form of craving is becoming more and more obvious. Why?

09:27.520 --> 09:33.360
Because you start recognizing that the certain ways when you intend an incline,

09:33.360 --> 09:42.400
makes you suffer, makes you feel too much, so to speak, makes you too involved, exposes you,

09:42.400 --> 09:46.640
makes you liable. By discerning those things, you stop intending like that.

09:46.640 --> 10:02.320
By not intending like that, you're not perpetuating the craving.

10:08.320 --> 10:13.040
It's in terms of feelings. Oh, yeah, so it's all, of course, it's always in relation to feelings.

10:13.040 --> 10:33.120
Yeah. So in an agreeable feeling that is present, you have to sort of discern the inclination,

10:34.240 --> 10:38.560
towards wanting more of it, or towards wanting to stay longer, or wanting to not go away so soon,

10:38.560 --> 10:43.840
or towards wanting to increase it, to intensify it, to prolong it, any of those things.

10:46.080 --> 10:51.040
In a disagreeable feeling, be the general disagreeable mood, or something more specific,

10:51.760 --> 10:56.640
you have to remove, or rather discern, and by discerning, you remove, and automatically,

10:56.640 --> 11:01.840
the inclination towards resisting it, towards trying to find the justification for it,

11:01.840 --> 11:07.360
which was trying to find an explanation for it, towards psychologizing it. Just any of those things

11:07.360 --> 11:13.280
are mechanisms which you try to engage in, so to remove it, get rid of it.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.960
And the subtlest of them is the neutral feeling when it's neither pleasant nor unpleasant,

11:18.960 --> 11:22.400
and that's when people give into distraction, delusion, indolence, laziness,

11:24.160 --> 11:26.960
like mental, mental, heedlessness.

11:26.960 --> 11:35.760
So if you don't do any of those three things, you're not prepared to do it in craving.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.960
And at the same time you could be able to feel, to be aware of your feelings.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.480
Oh yeah, of course. To the extent that they have a reason on their own,

11:50.480 --> 11:56.960
because feelings arise having a reason they cease on their own, you're not saying that.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.680
So you want to be, again, that's where mindfulness of feeling is discerning the nature basically.

12:06.560 --> 12:10.080
Knowing that they have a reason on their own, this pleasant experience at the moment,

12:11.120 --> 12:14.240
as a reason on its own basically, that's fine, so you don't keep,

12:14.240 --> 12:17.280
I must get rid of it, because pleasure means craving, no, it doesn't.

12:17.280 --> 12:22.640
Leaning too much towards that pleasure means craving.

12:23.440 --> 12:27.440
Leaning away from the disagreeable means craving.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.800
Leaning towards forgetfulness and distraction and

12:33.600 --> 12:35.520
leaning towards forgetfulness and distraction.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.880
That means craving in the neutral feeling.

12:38.880 --> 12:52.240
It's already been aware of those leanings towards feeling sleep, yeah, that's a good way to start.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.720
So you can't like having, oh this is my craving, because craving is in your attitude,

12:58.720 --> 13:02.000
but you can bring it down so precisely wherever you would see,

13:03.760 --> 13:08.640
either the presence of suffering, or the presence of the possibility to suffer, any of those

13:08.640 --> 13:15.200
is generated by the amount of you leaning. You'll automatically generate impossibility to

13:15.200 --> 13:22.960
suffering, which is in itself Dukha. So you use that to know whether you lean or not,

13:22.960 --> 13:39.760
a recognition of how liable to suffering does this make you.

13:39.760 --> 13:53.840
There's no method that's going to show you that. Of course not, because method is on the level

13:53.840 --> 13:58.000
almost like bodily action, or certainly bodily perceptions where you're just sort of

13:58.000 --> 14:02.720
perceiving or going through some motions. This is what we're talking about the intentions behind

14:02.720 --> 14:07.440
your actions. So whatever method you do you have to look at the intention behind which means method

14:07.440 --> 14:12.480
becomes redundant, which means method is your sealer. Method is your sensory strength,

14:12.480 --> 14:38.880
that's as close as the method as you can get. Method is your moderation in eating.

14:43.040 --> 14:49.440
There's no that's noting every movement of your mind,

14:49.440 --> 14:52.560
critically righted down. It's completely misplaced, looking at the wrong place.

14:54.560 --> 14:59.200
Because you're not seeing your intention to note, because you couldn't be noting your intention to note.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.200
Noting is an action which is already intended, which is already leaned towards,

15:06.560 --> 15:10.800
and you're not seeing that, by not seeing that no amount of engaging in the

15:10.800 --> 15:16.800
interaction with the reveal. Otherwise the Buddha wouldn't give in a method and describe it in

15:16.800 --> 15:22.160
the sutras. When they did ask him what's the direct method he said, a young man develops faith,

15:22.160 --> 15:27.280
leaves his home, lives restrained by the rules of patimoca, practices sensory strength, sees

15:27.280 --> 15:32.560
the danger in the slightest fault, moderates anything and devotes his time basically to wakefulness.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.880
First watch of the night, second watch of the night, third watch of the night, and then he understands

15:36.880 --> 15:42.880
that the rebirth has been sort of destroyed. And I remember the first time I read that as a layman,

15:42.880 --> 15:47.680
I was also looking for a method and I thought was this is just a general, why wouldn't he just give

15:47.680 --> 15:53.120
you a particular recipe how to become a light, because there isn't any. This is the most particular

15:53.120 --> 15:57.120
you can get. If you're not seeing it in a direct manner, it's just because all of the wrong views

15:57.120 --> 16:02.080
they're gonna tell away. So you need to meet that Buddha's instruction halfway, basically,

16:02.080 --> 16:07.840
or even two thirds of a way, to start to make sense. But if person don't change an interview,

16:07.840 --> 16:12.560
then they just add, on top of their views, their notion of other practices, that's what you get.

16:12.560 --> 16:19.200
Methods and modern repersonal techniques and whatnot. All methods of concentration and so on.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.520
Now you have to look at the intention behind actions and you can't concentrate on that,

16:25.520 --> 16:30.880
because it's behind your concentration. You can discern it, you can know it. That's

16:30.880 --> 16:36.800
where it's at, the consciousness is to be fully understood. Not to concentrate it on.

16:42.480 --> 16:48.880
So you can't be aware of your intention. You can be aware in that peripheral background manner,

16:48.880 --> 16:54.160
but awareness and concentration in terms of techniques is not the same thing. People are not aware

16:54.160 --> 16:57.920
when they're doing meditation technique, while they're opposite. They're practicing some sort of

16:57.920 --> 17:02.000
focusing exercise on one thing or the other, which means there's no general awareness there.

17:11.520 --> 17:16.480
To be able to see your intentions. They can only be seen indirectly.

17:20.080 --> 17:26.240
By the way, you are, well, whatever you're choosing. They can only be seen indirectly

17:26.240 --> 17:33.280
on the basis of your sensory strain and see life. You can't see them indirectly if you're on

17:33.280 --> 17:49.200
restraint. If you're not keeping the strength, you're not keeping the seal that you know that you are intending.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.680
I'm asking you intentions. I mean, yeah, you can have a notion of it to some extent, but like

17:53.680 --> 17:59.280
understanding the nature, like having, having that clarity generated to the point of being able

17:59.280 --> 18:05.040
to fully discern it, you won't have that. It is. It's like trying to collect the water in,

18:05.040 --> 18:11.360
I don't know, 10 meter deep pool tank. We're just constantly punching hole at the bottom of it.

18:11.360 --> 18:25.920
So it will never fill up to the bottom, to the top. And you need to have it filled up, basically.
