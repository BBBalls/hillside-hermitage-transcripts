1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,280
Actually, it's not only one question, it's probably two or three questions which are related.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,560
So I just simply summarized the question, but then I would like to speak a little bit

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,880
about what actually I am aiming to or what I would like you to speak about.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:37,120
The question is very quick, impermanent nature of six-cent basis and definition of six-cent

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
basis.

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:49,000
And what I am asking is because, you know, as regards external six-cent basis, it seems

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,280
almost like obvious that they are impermanent because they can't go into the range of our

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,280
experience.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,480
But still, I feel that people, if you can actually explain what are even these external

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,360
six-cent basis because I already noticed by listening your talks that you can actually

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,960
look at things from some unusual perspective.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,960
So even it looks obvious what it sounds or what it's formed, which is formed.

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Maybe you can actually offer a little bit of something, some perspective which I didn't

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
consider.

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:37,960
But what are also internal six-cent basis, like I, and me, and especially Manon, because

16
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,160
that's not so obvious, so if you can speak about this.

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:50,000
And finally, how to actually see the impermanence of seven-cent basis, especially these internal

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,320
ones, because, you know, the whole life, you live this ear or this eye, so it seems

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,360
that they are always there.

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:06,120
So how to actually directly see their impermanent nature, not only indirectly, like contemplating

21
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,800
that before you were born and when you die, you would do so.

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
Oh, yeah, that wouldn't work.

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Yeah.

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,120
Oh, no, not that sense of an insight, if you work in a sense of explanation.

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Yeah.

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,440
So I would allow this phenomenological approach, how to actually see that the ear or the eye

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,040
is, and the mind is impermanent.

28
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,640
And well, let me start then with a first bit, with a six-centurnal basis, which we then,

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,080
I think it will make, obviously, what I mean, what I mean, what I mean when we're talking

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,480
about it, it talks about the external ones, because they're actually not the external counterparts

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,880
or the sense-based, the external objects are not actually easier to see as impermanent.

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,560
It's the common misconception of what the external world is, and then people assume that,

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,480
oh, yeah, this is ever-changing and impermanent, but that's not actually even on the level

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,120
of the external sense-based scene properly, on the external objects, sorry.

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,840
So the internal basis, basically, well, in a most practical approach, that's what your

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,480
body is.

37
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,760
Like you can divide it into six, you can say the eyes, the nose, the tongue, the body as

38
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,040
a sense of touch, and then the mind, it's obviously inseparated from the body as a whole.

39
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,840
You can pin it down to brain or you can pin it down to anything more particular, but the

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,280
point is, when there is no body, the mind cannot remain standing.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,640
So in that sense, basically, on a practical level, it's the learning how to see the body

42
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,080
rightly would sort of reveal the whole six-fold sense-based scene properly as impermanent

43
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,520
and eventually as that which cannot be taken as self.

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:05,680
So for that practical approach, basically, what you need to see is that you can't take

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,720
up those senses, or you can't take up the body even if you want to, why?

46
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,880
Because it's structurally impossible to own it, you can't access it and make deals.

47
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,960
Not knowing that, you assume it's yours, you can't, you don't know that actually no actually

48
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,200
cannot be mine.

49
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,680
Like you know there's a phenomenon of mine that's something belonged to you.

50
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,960
Well these things are impenetrable to that, I mean you can't own them, but not knowing

51
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,440
that sufficiently enough, you own them just through that.

52
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,520
So if you want to see it impermanence, you don't need any explanation in terms of a previous

53
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,000
life and this future life, all you need to see is that that which has already arisen

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,800
eye your body, your six senses precede you, precede your sense of ownership, precede

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,520
your sense of self.

56
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,040
And by preceding means, oh, it comes first, I come second, that's I cannot be the master

57
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,000
of it, because if I'm the master of something, I come first.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,400
So that which you think comes first actually comes second, and that which you think comes

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,160
second actually comes first.

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,440
And by dwelling just on that, accurately enough, you would stop regarding it as yours.

61
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,360
And then by literally by default, by simply by not regarding the internal sense basis

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,160
as yours, then everything else depends upon them, you won't be able to regard as your

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,200
either, which means you won't be affected by it.

64
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,840
Yes, it makes sense, but this is like an Anata aspect, but it seems that it's always Anata

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,640
comes after understanding properly Anichha.

66
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,080
So it comes after in a sense of, in a structural sense, not after in a sense of time, it's

67
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
the same insight.

68
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,160
Anichha duka is simultaneous insight of Anata on the level of self.

69
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,480
So if you see the depth upon which your sense of self depends, cannot be yours.

70
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,880
That sense of self is not your life, and that's what Anata is.

71
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,160
So the sense of self, it depends upon the sixfold base or the body, that's how it's come

72
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,400
taken, and then the self is assumed priority, and then the self owns these senses, owns

73
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
this body and operates with them.

74
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,680
But that's because there's no wisdom in a relative sense, and it's not seen that actually

75
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
is the sense of their rise on their own.

76
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,080
The body is given before him, you just find it, you find your right, you find the world

77
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,840
revealed by your rise and so on.

78
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,880
So if that's understood, then this self, it depends upon that body, cannot be owned

79
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,040
because this is seen as impossible to access in terms of that ownership.

80
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,000
So Anichha and duka automatically means it's felt like Anata, simultaneously.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,840
So it's not one, two, three.

82
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,600
In terms of our first, you see Anichha, then you spend two, three days thinking about

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,880
duka, then you spend two, three days thinking about Anata.

84
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,000
If you see Anichha properly, that's what duka is, and that experience is a whole, will

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,200
not be the difference of the sense of self, because there is no room for the appropriation.

86
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:09,760
Can one, like, practice it, you know, during your day, you just remind yourself, this

87
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,160
understanding, is this the practice?

88
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,520
Well, it is to begin with, but then he has to become a more accurate in the sense of,

89
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,720
you actually, you have to be able to see what that phenomenon of the body, i.e. the

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,440
sense-based is, in your presence and experience, without having to analyze it, without having

91
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,640
to keep repeating what you read, are the eyes, this, the nose, this, and you just, when

92
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,800
you see it, you see it.

93
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,760
But probably in the beginning, you mean it, you mean it, yeah.

94
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,240
So basically, that's what I've been talking about.

95
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,360
I don't think maybe I didn't, we didn't upload them yet, but in the last few talks, it's

96
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,080
basically that any sort of contemplation you do cannot be just based on your thinking

97
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,400
as it is now, because that thinking as it is now is fully affected by ignorance, and

98
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
by wrong views.

99
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,200
So it means, even if you get the right instructions, you'll be applying them along the wrong lines.

100
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,520
So you want to begin to learn how to think properly phenomenologically, and thinking properly

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,040
means seeing things properly, that's it, because thoughts are images, they're being seen.

102
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:20,120
And you begin that by starting every contemplation, or any sort of reasoning, even, on the basis

103
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,840
of mindfulness, of the experience as a whole.

104
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,560
So you don't just kind of go in a mystical awe, or like, you know, including the experience

105
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
of the whole understanding.

106
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
No, that's just the beginning.

107
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,800
So you're mindful of the experience, and you're mindful of the situation, you're mindful

108
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,640
of the situation in this room, feeling certain mood, feeling certain feelings, having certain

109
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
perceptions.

110
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
And that's it.

111
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,040
So without losing the sight of that, you begin to think.

112
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,320
So basically, then the contemplation does not become like a, like a mental fabrication

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,360
instruction, it becomes more of a practice of discernment, practice of discernment, practice

114
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,480
of basically looking into, or rather finding things that you've been hearing about in this

115
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,080
which is in front of you, and that which is in front of you is that which is revealed

116
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,640
through that mindfulness of your situation, experience as a whole.

117
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,000
So in other words, what I'm saying is, things you want to contemplate, you don't want

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,200
to contemplate on your own terms, you want to find those things as already there in

119
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,480
that experience, which means you need to learn how to be properly mindful of the experience

120
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,520
so that these things can be discerned within that.

121
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Why?

122
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Because feeling is already there.

123
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,040
All of the six senses are depending on what approach you take, all of the six senses

124
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
are already there.

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,760
So you don't need to think about six senses and then explain to yourself what they are.

126
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,760
You just need to see them as they are right there while you're thinking about them.

127
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,880
And that can be done only on the basis of mindfulness.

128
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,800
That's where mindfulness always comes first, and that's where you can't have too much

129
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,000
of the mindfulness.

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,600
So without a mindfulness, no amount of precise instruction or anything like that can make

131
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
much of a difference because you just start on a wrong basis.

132
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,880
So can we say that mindfulness is like the establishing the working field on which you

133
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
are.

134
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Sure.

135
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Sure.

136
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Yeah.

137
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,720
But even that mindfulness needs to be sort of recognized as if coming from the situation,

138
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,840
not coming from you and your intention to be mindful.

139
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,200
So is it also dependent on conditions, is it something also which can be without this?

140
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Sure.

141
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Yeah, of course.

142
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Of course.

144
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,880
It's just obviously in the beginning, whatever you intend, whatever you directed attention

145
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,640
in your mind, it sort of assumed that it's rooted in the self.

146
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,560
So that's why the mindfulness is quite impersonal even for the self of you.

147
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,840
That's why it's a necessary base.

148
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,960
It's a kind of semi-neutral base from which you can go the other way, the right way.

149
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,280
But without it, you can't possibly go the right way because you're immediately already

150
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,400
in the wrong tracks, tracks of the sense of self.

151
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:50,560
So you try to get the mindfulness as strong as possible in a sense of as clear as non-interferent,

152
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:58,080
as wise as possible so that then the other tracks, tracks of non-self can be recognized.

153
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,200
And that just takes practice.

154
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
So is it to like to see the whole situation?

155
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,920
Well, again, now you're trying to kind of put the whole situation in front of you.

156
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
But as I said, you find yourself in it.

157
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,160
So instead of trying to put things in front of you, you step back into them because you

158
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,000
are already in them.

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,520
You are already in a situation where you want to be or not.

160
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
You are always in a situation.

161
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,080
That's where the four foundations of mindfulness, one of the main things are four postures

162
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
of the body.

163
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,960
Because you're always in a posture of the body, which is a kind of a symbol for a situation.

164
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,000
You're seated, you're walking while something else, you're lying down, you're standing,

165
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and so on.

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,120
Actually those things are not just some weird kind of physiological sort of meditation

167
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
methods.

168
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
No, they're phenomena.

169
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,720
They're kind of rooting you back into a situation that you cannot escape from.

170
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
I see.

171
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:55,320
And so you recognize your situation, so it's just like a small movement behind, so to speak,

172
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,080
on the background, maybe you just recognize it, back it out, the background, yeah.

173
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,680
It's not vulnerable, you don't need to think much about it.

174
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,160
You just make this movement of mine to realize, just to include, so you don't need to include

175
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
anything that's in front of you now, but you just want to include more than what's in

176
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,640
front of you now, because that's not enough.

177
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,200
And you include that background, because that background, which is your situation, well,

178
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,400
if you include it long enough with a proper instruction, it becomes apparent, you have

179
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,560
no say in it.

180
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,040
And then you realize you have no say even in what's in front of you, because you can only

181
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,600
have things in front of you based on the background, based on the situation that has

182
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
a reason.

183
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,360
In other words, if you have no eyes, if there are no forms to be seen, wanting sites, having

184
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
desire towards sites, intentions towards sites, it's inconceivable.

185
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
Yeah.

186
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
It's just inconceivable.

187
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,640
You have that something that's completely taken for granted.

188
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,160
And that's how many people think they understood the truth, because as you can see, it makes

189
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
sense perfectly.

190
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Yeah, sure.

191
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,400
There are no eyes, I couldn't see.

192
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,040
But if you were to truly understand that, you'd be free from any desire in regards to the

193
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
domain of sight, anything you ever seen, anything you ever would be seen.

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,680
You'd be almost an unorganic, basically.

195
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,400
So why that, why is that not happening then, because you realize, ah, so this understanding,

196
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,720
so to speak, it's actually understanding only if it's seen in proper terms, on its own

197
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,320
terms, not on your own terms.

198
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Exactly.

199
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,560
It's actually not understanding at all, because if it is, well, it depends what you want

200
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
to use.

201
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,760
If you want to use understanding for, like, kind of intellectual sort of making sense,

202
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,880
then yeah, this is more than that.

203
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,000
But I think you can still use the same word understanding, because you share the same

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,480
nature of something being understood.

205
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,760
It's just not sufficient understanding, because you can understand things intellectually,

206
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,640
and then you can take it further, if you realize, okay, well, understanding is unlikely,

207
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,000
should free me from suffering.

208
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,440
My intellectual understanding, not free me from suffering, so I need to take it further.

209
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I mean, you can take it further, by making further abstraction of you, but that's not

210
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,640
going to make any difference, and you will know that soon enough.

211
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,760
So then you take it further, basically, by kind of taking it deeper, or taking it backwards

212
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:14,520
so to speak, by spreading it about, by sort of, well, by making it pertain to the roots

213
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,840
of your experience.

214
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,000
And that's why it's kind of, young is someone that comes over as one of the main factors,

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,440
the right instruction, and that kind of root, attention, young is someone's womb, so

216
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,160
going back to the very origin.

217
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,800
Not origin, in terms of the explanation, like, 16 lifetimes ago or done, such a such thing.

218
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
No, the origin of your present situation, which is, you're given both the seed, the form

219
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,240
of it, the feelings, the simultaneously present with that, the perception, and so on,

220
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,840
the five aggregates.

221
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:49,080
So if you can even put it into the difference, if you can be also in relation to understanding,

222
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
sure.

223
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,720
And then it comes upon you.

224
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Oh, that's wisdom.

225
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Yeah, that's what it was like.

226
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,440
That's the final wisdom, man.

227
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Yeah.

228
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,280
So, basically, that practice can be summarized, like, as much as you can to do this movement,

229
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:08,320
to go back to the mindfulness to see this root of your experience.

230
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Yeah.

231
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,800
So you can see, basically, why, see, well, I hope you can see, because many people talk

232
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
about mindfulness.

233
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,760
It's not, you know, it's not a new thing.

234
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,400
But you could see how often tends to be either mystified or sort of played down, mystified

235
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,840
in a sense, when you'll hear the teachings often for the monks or for the other kind

236
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,680
of other teachers and other religions, but kind of also at the same basic, it could just

237
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,600
be present here and now, where everybody in your mind, and that's it.

238
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
That's it.

239
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
That's what it culminates.

240
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
That's it.

241
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,920
But that's actually, you could see, like, that's what go for them, where you could see,

242
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,080
if you were actually doing it right from the sutras, that should be only the very first

243
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
step there.

244
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,320
That's like that working field on issues, yeah, because, you know, I...

245
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,920
But people who have, people have a view, like if people don't know what they're supposed

246
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
to look for.

247
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,200
If they don't know that they are supposed to look for something, then they'll inevitably

248
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,240
automatically mystify their experience.

249
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,200
So even if they do the Buddhist mindfulness, they'll mystify it, because they'll just

250
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,440
be, you know, expecting it to teach them and to show them the reality or something, it

251
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
doesn't work for that.

252
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,640
You have to basically discern.

253
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,040
And that's why it's so hard, because you can see how, if a wrong instruction,

254
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,480
is given, or if a right instruction hasn't been sufficiently understood, you won't see

255
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,600
it, because you don't know what you're supposed to see.

256
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,880
So can they actually say, you know, some people, they say that actually just mindfulness

257
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,880
is enough in that sense, that it, when you practice it, other things reveal by themselves.

258
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
No.

259
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,400
Well, the other thing you reveal by themselves, only if you already have a basis of wisdom

260
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,240
and a criteria of the right view, I, if you're a sottipana, then all you have to do is

261
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,360
keep staying mindful and the virtues, and then things will be completely clear, because

262
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,320
you already have that knife that's cutting automatically, you just have to keep directing

263
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
it.

264
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,960
But for Patujana, it needs to be more than that.

265
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,040
Mindfulness, mindfulness is equal, as I said, it's kind of the most neutral aspect of

266
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,400
the experience of the revealing situation, but it still comes from the angle of Patujana.

267
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,920
And it can ultimately, recklessly or spontaneously just tip over and become a right view.

268
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
You have to make it so.

269
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Yeah.

270
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
So you don't need that instruction.

271
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Yeah.

272
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Exactly.

273
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Yeah, I see.

274
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,600
Because, you know, I was contemplating that if you go right for these retreats, you can

275
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,400
spend weeks or months practicing mindfulness, but without not much results.

276
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah.

277
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,520
And then it's like a question, how, actually, how many thousands of hours you need to do

278
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:45,720
this to move forward, or if it is actually completely into the inner requires, yeah.

279
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,840
And you can see, as you just see in yourself, when you're sort of trying to come around

280
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,080
what I was saying, like, even with the right instruction now, you're supposed to step back.

281
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,960
You can do that in an overly controlling manner, or I'm stepping back.

282
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,360
This is my situation, and you're actually over intending it, which means you're not really

283
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
stepping back.

284
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,240
It means you're the craving of your sense of self, of your intentionality, it's taking

285
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
over.

286
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,680
And that's something that will inevitably happen, and you just have to keep it in check.

287
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,920
And then sort of tune, fine tune, that attitude of stepping in without over intending it.

288
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Yeah.

289
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,800
Because if you over intend the background, it becomes that which you intend in the foreground,

290
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,960
which means that at that time, something else is that background that you're not seeing.

291
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah.

292
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,200
But it also is actually quite difficult to grasp.

293
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Oh, yeah.

294
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Oh, yeah.

295
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Yeah.

296
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
That's why it's so easy to misunderstood.

297
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,040
That's why all of the meditation, the techniques and stuff.

298
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,600
They might be repeating these same things, but they do it with this kind of control of

299
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,400
kind of watching, touching, observing, observing, observing, all on the terms of the sense of

300
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
self.

301
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
That's what remains rooted in.

302
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,400
And then if you do step in, sometimes rightly, into that background without sort of over intending

303
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
it, then you don't know what you're supposed to look for.

304
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
Then you tend to mystify it.

305
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,720
And then you glorify that experience, but it's equally effective in the Vigia as it

306
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
was before.

307
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,680
It had potential for understanding if you were to have instructions that you can use to

308
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,440
discern what's supposed to be discerned, but without that, you won't, you just cannot.

309
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,480
I mean, it's still good to learn how to keep stepping because eventually, say that working

310
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,000
field has been developed properly, expanded, spread about more and more, even without the

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
right instruction.

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,320
Then you're going to need very little instruction eventually because you were used to the right

313
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,560
proper stepping into the situation, familiarize yourself with it, became established in it.

314
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,080
And then the Buddha can just tell you, are, in the scene, let there just be the scene and

315
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,560
there can be enough for you because you already done the actual work.

316
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,560
You just needed the last sort of drop of, ah, of course, yeah, I should have looked at

317
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
it like that.

318
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
And that's it.

319
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,840
But obviously, people kind of are not quite there either when they begin, so they sort

320
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,320
of, you have to be developing both, clarifying the instruction as much as you can, making

321
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,800
your sense out of it, not just reading it for inspiration, poetic value, or scholastic

322
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
merit.

323
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,120
And then you're going to need to be able to understand it, and simultaneously developing

324
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,520
your mind in terms of mindfulness, because that's what the mind is, it's the establishment

325
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,000
of mindfulness that sort of reaches a certain strength.

326
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,400
And the samadhi means composure, being composed, that field of working field, it remains composed

327
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,840
throughout the day, throughout the situations, throughout the circumstances, it remains composed,

328
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,640
mind is in samadhi, mind is composed, that you can say the same.

329
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,960
But because of the, as I said, because of this kind of attempt to mystify things, even

330
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,040
the play mindfulness, people mystify, then you start having, ah, sort of views of such

331
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
nature.

332
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,000
Views of, like, ah, that experience will teach you that it's been about the novel, it's

333
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,520
about the new experience, that you never experience, you must be the reality behind

334
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,120
and so on and on top of that.

335
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,320
So you end up building up lots of wrong views, just, just on account of that very simple

336
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
thing in the beginning.

337
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Yeah.

338
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:11,040
And then when you say meditation, you immediately mind all of the things, it's some sort of

339
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,960
ecstatic absorption somewhere in some genre or some realm.

340
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,440
But even genres, like, you know, he enters in a biased genre and then whether he extends

341
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,160
his arm, whether he walks, whether he goes to eat the food, he's mind remained, ah, unaffected

342
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
by things.

343
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,680
And that's in the soup, but not according to the modern ideas of what genre is when

344
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:37,960
you kind of have gone, basically, motionless, like a rock or something like that.

345
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,280
So can we, can we now, ah, go back to this impermanent nature of Sixth and Sixth?

346
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Sure.

347
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,560
So the impermanence of it, again, you can be reading into it things and you kind of have

348
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:57,200
to start like that, but you won't, even that, you, any understanding of the relevant nature,

349
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,960
you want to be discerning it from things.

350
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,120
So you know what you're supposed to look for, but you want to find it there.

351
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,360
So it's a kind of, it's like, as I said, things by themselves can't eat you, but just

352
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,880
your own thinking and explanation, self-explanation won't eat you either.

353
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,880
So you want to reach a degree of like, I'm looking for impermanence, how I understood it,

354
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,800
what understood it, I want to recognize it.

355
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,840
So it's about recognizing it in your experience that which you have understood, in this case,

356
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,680
impermanence.

357
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,720
And so probably the main characteristic permanence that I could sort of use that you could probably

358
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,260
relate to is the recognition that whenever you step into that situation properly, you

359
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,360
will always find your body as already there, which means you have actually no say in

360
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,080
its appearance, in its persistence.

361
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,240
And that's the important thing.

362
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,360
That's another thing that the people who don't do mindfulness correctly cannot understand,

363
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,960
the phenomenon of endurance, and I think we spoke about it before, when the Buddha says

364
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,400
that rising is manifest, ceasing is manifested, or phenomenon in general, changing well-standing

365
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
or enduring is manifested.

366
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,600
So people usually change the order of how the Buddha said that rising is manifested,

367
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,560
ceasing is manifested, changing well-standing is manifested, but the people say, a rising

368
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,520
is manifested, changing well-standing is manifested, ceasing is manifested, and you can see how

369
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
it becomes linear.

370
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,240
You see things are rising, you see things persisting, you see things disappearing, you see

371
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,440
things, and that leaves a sense of self-art.

372
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Completely.

373
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,160
That's not space to mindfulness, that kind of view.

374
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,760
No matter how much mindfulness try to put in it, it won't work.

375
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,600
What you're going to find is things already there, which means you're going to find things

376
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,600
already persisting, which means it's the enduring, the third aspect, that's the most fundamental

377
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
aspect.

378
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,200
And you can see, if something is arising, if something is increasing in its presence,

379
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,720
it remains the same while changing.

380
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,000
If something is fading out, if something is ceasing, if something is decreasing in its

381
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,920
presence, it remains the same while fading out, while changing.

382
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,720
So you realize that arising or ceasing, persisting while changing is already present in those

383
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
things.

384
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,040
And that's how you learn to not interfere with things.

385
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,560
They endure on their own, because they have a reason on their own.

386
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:27,480
So the point is, by recognizing that things have a reason on their own, or recognizing

387
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,360
that whatever you find in this situation, you already find it there, enduring, either

388
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,680
increasing in its presence or decreasing in its presence, either way, it's persisting

389
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
while changing.

390
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,840
Just a different direction, so to speak.

391
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,320
So can you actually see something arising?

392
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:51,680
No, no, no, you can't see the first point, like, no, now there it is, because there

393
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,520
will be two separate things.

394
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,600
First no, that's the one reason thing, then something else, that's not.

395
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,120
So every change, every arising, every ceasing is abrupt, and that's when you're going

396
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,080
to be talking about as well.

397
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
It's abrupt.

398
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
It's abrupt?

399
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Abrupt.

400
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Abrupt.

401
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,440
So you just find it as arising, or you just find it as ceasing.

402
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,520
So all the time you're actually in that first phase, or that middle phase?

403
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Exactly.

404
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,560
They're just changing directions, so to speak.

405
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,160
That's why arising is my, that's why often it's kind of permitted sometimes when it

406
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,760
says, oh, and then he remained contemplating, arising and falling of the five aggregates,

407
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
and he became an Arab.

408
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Yes.

409
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,960
Because arising and falling is persisting while changing.

410
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,840
So he remains seeing things correctly, either as a situation, a reason beforehand, not

411
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,680
interfering, not appropriating, for the amount of time necessary, for the amount to become

412
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
pure.

413
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,160
So you say that arising and seeing is abrupt, and it's like two different experiences.

414
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,120
You're just finding, and as you find a situation, you find it either arising, or you find

415
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
it as ceasing.

416
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,040
Depending what's the main sort of color, so to speak.

417
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,560
So you can break it in the way that you compare your experience with previous experiences?

418
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
No.

419
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,400
The experience, with previous experience, means in your background, the both things together

420
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,200
are now one experience that you're thinking about, and you're not seeing it as such.

421
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,720
So that's what it means, also, like a colleague, a timeless.

422
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,640
It doesn't involve time, because no matter how much time it's involved in terms of its increasing

423
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,680
in its presence or decreasing, while remaining the same in simultaneously, with that kind of

424
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:35,160
time-line of a thing, simultaneously, things keep the identity of itself.

425
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,000
So there's no time involved between those things, and that's what you start seeing.

426
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,160
And seeing an identity of a thing is nothing other than seeing a nature of a thing, which

427
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:51,160
is nothing other than seeing dharma, because dharma means nature, dharma means the nature.

428
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,160
And but if you, if you basically observe this and you're changing by spending, cannot

429
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,280
happen that you think that it's stable, it's something which you're observing it, and

430
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
that's already in the state.

431
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,600
You can kind of observe it.

432
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,000
You can find it in that situation.

433
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,040
So you step back and you find yourself in the situation.

434
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,480
So you learn, it's all about learning how to step back and stay back without over-intending

435
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,000
and making it in front of you again.

436
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,040
And that's what the development of mine is, like 101.

437
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,560
So how to do it?

438
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,880
How to step back and try to clarify as much as possible what's stepping back and tell,

439
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,880
what you're supposed to discern, what you're supposed to find.

440
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,200
And if you do it long enough, then it will become more normal to see to find things as

441
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,800
opposed to overly intent things and put them in front of you as that which you think

442
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,840
things are.

443
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,320
So it's still formal thinking, but not that forward thinking, so to speak, which is usually

444
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,120
what people think thinking is.

445
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:03,720
So that's, it's on that level about impermanence is, because you already find a thing originally.

446
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,960
And you see, you can't even conceive where it would have come from.

447
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,560
Because even that, as in a recent experience, you already find it has come from.

448
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,440
So just the notion of it came from somewhere, becomes redundant.

449
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,120
Thus you stop conceiving things as in, out, apart, same, different, both same and different

450
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,200
and I, the same or different, none of those things continue to apply eventually for another

451
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
hand.

452
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,160
Yeah, because, yeah, as you said, you are always in, in the situation, you cannot actually

453
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,560
escape like with this body, and then you just, you just step back and you just see that

454
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,440
the body is dead, you know, it's all like the whole life is dead.

455
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Exactly.

456
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,200
And that's why, by practicing that mindfulness, you start to develop what Nehru was talking

457
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,560
about, chitta, nimita, the sign of the mind, the sign of that phenomena, the sign of

458
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,200
the phenomena of the experience as a whole, which is what your mind is.

459
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,640
Your mind is with perception and feeling that simultaneously present, which is pretty much

460
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,920
as, as, as background as it can be.

461
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,720
So grasping the sign of that, basically by seeing that actually you're always in the situation,

462
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,480
you will stop assuming the existence of any notion of self or control or master independent

463
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,520
of any situation, which is what art of art is, assuming itself independent of the five

464
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,880
aggregates, assuming the self independent of the situation as a whole, assuming the self

465
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,480
as external to everything.

466
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,640
So the master is a creator, but you realize that even when you have that assumption, you

467
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,760
have it within the situation upon which has, which has a reason beforehand, so you realize

468
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,200
even that doesn't make sense anymore.

469
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,400
So you, having a self view, stops making sense, and then you can't have self-realism.

470
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
So it always comes after birth?

471
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,040
Yes, what is just, is just, the mind cannot engage in it anymore, because it's just seen

472
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,600
as a fully completely, completely contradictory.

473
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:54,400
So if I understand, it's well, the point is to correctly grasp this, let's say, practice,

474
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,520
correctly grasp this understanding, and then just repeat it, and repeat it, and repeat it.

475
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
Yeah.

476
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,320
Simultaneously to that, to keep sort of studying the meaning of the sutras or the instruction

477
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,320
or the instruction that you have faith in, that you can be a contemporary instruction,

478
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,640
so the instruction that you have faith in, not like any, because most of it won't lead

479
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
you this way.

480
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,080
If you send you like just a long year forward thinking, either through meditation technique

481
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,440
or something, or a mantra or what's not, I don't know.

482
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,640
So you want to keep sort of enriching your understanding of what you're supposed to recognize,

483
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,400
because the wider basis, the more information you have, the easier it's going to be to see.

484
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,400
But it seems very simple from sutras what we are supposed to recognize.

485
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,240
Yeah, and yeah, if your base is wide enough, if your stepping in situation is not corrupted

486
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,000
and it is today for most of the people, then yeah, you wouldn't need this very much.

487
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,920
You already need somebody to point you, no, no, no, look the other way, and then you

488
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
would see that.

489
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,920
And that's why people would sometimes just run into the Buddha and hear the teaching and

490
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,560
become a self-opinant, because, well, their notion, their daily experience, their average

491
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,840
experience of situation has not been polluted, has not been proliferated as it is today.

492
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,360
Like, you can see today, like, even if I talk, anybody talks about the notion of like

493
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,320
situation and time of phenomena, it's just like what?

494
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,760
Now, there's some weird philosophy or something, and people dismiss it.

495
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,560
And if you look where the people's views are on an average level, it's all about modern

496
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,480
science, where you just assume the public world, the public time, the public space, the

497
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,720
violin habit, and it's all in person, all of everything, and constantly changing and

498
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
stuff.

499
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,640
You assume that as external to your situation, but you fail to see that any assumption has

500
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,280
to remain within that situation, so assumption that assumes something external situation

501
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,400
is assumption that doesn't make sense.

502
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,240
It's impossible to assume anything external to the situation, because whatever you think

503
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,160
of, it's going to be within the situation.

504
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,680
You cannot step outside of that.

505
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,000
Not dwelling on that long enough, you develop all of the views that assume outside of it,

506
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and that's all it takes.

507
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,880
That's where a video is effortless, ignorance, just ignoring that it's impossible to step

508
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,480
outside of the situation.

509
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,800
Not dwelling on it deep enough, it will make a video grow, that's it, you don't actually

510
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:22,400
have to engage in a video in any other manner, just ignore it, that's why it's called ignorance.

511
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,960
And that's why it's not a metaphysical ignorance, hidden somewhere, a secret that you need to

512
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,440
sort of, you know, unlock and a regal that you need to solve.

513
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,960
No, it's your very attitude, every single day, every single moment of your life, when

514
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,960
you turn away from your situation that has a reason, that's how you maintain your origin.

515
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,600
Just by looking at the wrong place, constantly, by assuming things in the wrong place.

516
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:51,600
One thing I was thinking of today, actually, was, let me just spoke a lot about the situation,

517
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,120
being mindful of it, and the stricken ones thinking of yourself in a situation, I've been

518
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,240
trying to think about what it exactly means to recognize on the situation, like obviously

519
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,120
I can give you some words, like sitting here, asking you a question, and you can actually

520
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,200
take your lives as far as you want to.

521
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,880
Because of the very thing, that's why it's so easy to mystify it, it's not easy to recognize

522
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
situations.

523
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,160
You might be thinking you recognize it, but then you start doubting, well, I'm a recognized

524
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,080
situation, or I'm a recognized in what I create to be a situation.

525
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,600
And if you have that doubt, it means, well, that's not a situation, the situation cannot

526
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,800
be accessed by doubt either, but you're doubting in situation.

527
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,280
So you can doubt situation, but if that's also a situation, and if that's seen, that

528
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,440
which has been seen, cannot be accessed by that doubt, that's being situational, so

529
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
to speak.

530
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,840
So that's why you just have to keep doing it, until that doubt of that very situation,

531
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,520
that you're in, stops touching that situation, so to speak, stops entering it.

532
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,320
Because again, and you can stop entering, basically, the situation with your doubt, by

533
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,960
recognizing the doubt, the very doubt, while you're doubting it, is within the situation.

534
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,720
It's really tricky, because even like I'm now sitting here, it seems to me that, now

535
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,800
I can do it once you are talking about it, but then the question is, is it religion

536
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
this?

537
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,920
No, because what you probably do is, you just, ah, I am in this situation, so you kind

538
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:26,400
of, again, originate from the sense of self, from the center of the I am, it's basically

539
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,760
learning how to see things very thoroughly, without looking in them directly.

540
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,840
That's how you start discerning the situation.

541
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,040
So whatever you're looking right now, you don't want to move your, look away from it,

542
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,320
because then it would become another thing you're looking at.

543
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Yes.

544
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,480
So while you're looking at it, simultaneously, while you're looking at it, you want to

545
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,480
discern other things that you're not looking at directly, which is where your situation

546
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,560
is, which is when you body is, your moods, your feelings, the five aggregates, the background.

547
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,520
But if you look at the background directly, it's on the background and then, I don't know

548
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,680
if you have noticed on a kind of a clear, summer sky at night, full of stars.

549
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,880
And if you look at one star and you look long enough, and then you see lots of stars appearing

550
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,160
around it peripherally, but if you move your eyes from the central star and look at this,

551
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
you can't see them.

552
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,440
You can only see them peripherally.

553
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,120
You can only see them if you don't look at them directly.

554
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,760
And you check that sometimes, you'll see, well, this is the same principle.

555
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,000
The background can be revealed rightly only if you don't look at it directly.

556
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's why it's like learning how to see.

557
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,980
That's why it says, so the point is one who sees, because he suddenly saw it like that

558
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,240
and then learned how to see it.

559
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,440
Like, well, not suddenly saw it like that.

560
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,560
He kept trying to see it correctly, eventually built up the right scene and now he sees.

561
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,240
Because most of the stuff it's not seen.

562
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
The background is not seen.

563
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
It's hard.

564
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
We're always facing different things, one thing.

565
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Yes.

566
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
And just with the different.

567
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
We don't want to another.

568
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,880
It's entirely obscured by people's looking, nothing else obscures it.

569
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,360
Like the only reason you don't see the peripher of that is because you stare it directly.

570
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,480
That's it.

571
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,600
But if staring, I think directly is your mode of existence, that's all you have.

572
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,920
And that's what it is for most people.

573
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,280
What I caught myself doing was like trying to take stock of things to find that you're

574
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
in the code there.

575
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
I'm feeling there.

576
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Yes.

577
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
Yes.

578
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
No.

579
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
No.

580
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
No.

581
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Yes.

582
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
The situation is the same thing.

583
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Yes.

584
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
The firebag.

585
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
It is.

586
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
But it's not when you put them in front of them, which is not the aggregate.

587
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
You are not seeing the situation.

588
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,600
You are seeing what you put in front of you, which means you have left things out.

589
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:41,520
So it keeps making that effort to learn how to mindful of the background while you're looking

590
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
at different things.

591
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:48,400
Simultaneous to present a two layers of experience, so to speak.

592
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,760
Where did I brought up with you some time ago that I think it's good, because it seemed

593
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
to help me wrap my head around.

594
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,800
It was like a contact, like everything in a contact.

595
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Sure.

596
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
There's something.

597
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,840
The things that buy itself, unify it.

598
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Yes.

599
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
The context in the general level.

600
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
I think so.

601
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,440
It could be also other than that the context.

602
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
Sure.

603
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,520
Situation, there's already something, some significance applied in it.

604
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,320
It's not like just in personal listing of wall, chair, table, that's my situation, space

605
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
or something.

606
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,320
It's the meaning.

607
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
It's the feeling.

608
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
It's the mood.

609
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Any of that is a background.

610
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
The firebag is at a background.

611
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,320
The nature of the firebag is at a background.

612
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:38,120
So the man you're practising for some days is a mindfulness here, taking your awareness

613
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:46,480
of a general situation and discerning a particular part of it.

614
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Like the posture or the movements and going from there?

615
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,040
Well, first, the first set of potanas can be only done after they arrive here.

616
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,240
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be trying, but I don't think you're actually doing the

617
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,080
same until there is the complete clarity in regard to what situation is.

618
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,760
And then, well, basically then when you think about a posture, you think about the other

619
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,960
end of that situation, the background, almost with the fundamental basis.

620
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,360
That's why you can either think about a bodily posture or the body as a whole.

621
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,440
Like, he is mindful of the body internally, the body externally, the body internally

622
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,720
or he's mindful of the thought the body is there, that the body is there, to the extent

623
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,040
necessary for the final knowledge.

624
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,920
And that the body is there, pertains to that the firebag around with his mind is developed

625
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,160
to the extent necessary of seeing that background without appropriating it, without making it

626
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
foreground.

627
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,640
To the sufficient extent necessary to completely remove any appropriation of the body.

628
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,680
The body is there, the body is there, King Coconut is there, the cat is there, the dogs

629
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,240
are there, it's there, nothing to do with me, nothing, it cannot have anything to do

630
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,680
with me, even if I want to, it's just there to be.

631
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,640
And then you think about that long enough, let it endure whichever way it arises, whichever

632
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,520
way it ceases, you let it endure, in the sense the body is there, and you will remove

633
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,320
any sort of affinity, any sort of attitude, any assumption, any appropriation of the body

634
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
as much.

635
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,320
And it's regards mind.

636
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,160
Well, that's already, the mind is already included, because how can you see the background

637
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,120
without seeing your mind?

638
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,120
It's not like, see, if you were to think about your body in medical terms, then you would

639
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,520
need to mind out, and then the question you just asked would be valid, or where is

640
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,840
the mind then?

641
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,520
But you can see, if you see a body on that background level, as enduring, as in a reason

642
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,320
necessary basis for your experience as a whole, means your mind is already, that's where

643
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,680
your mind is.

644
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,320
You can't see the background without seeing the mind, because that's what the mind is.

645
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,240
That's where the satisfaction comes to mind, it just describes the mind in those ambiguous

646
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,600
background general terms, it is, his mind is elated, or has depressed, or has shrunk,

647
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,120
or is expanded, or is it light, or is it heavy, the background, the mood, the distance,

648
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120
and the spirit.

649
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,120
That's what the mind is.

650
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,760
So as you can see, by thinking the mind is elsewhere, or opposed to the body, people

651
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,120
don't even see the basic notion of the mind, and that's what Chitanimity is.

652
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,000
And that's what people cannot get the right view, because one of the conditions for the

653
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,800
right view is Chitanimity, is the sign of the mind, that proper phenomenological sign

654
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
of the mind.

655
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,440
As it is, not as you projected to be, you find your mind there as well.

656
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,240
You find the mind expanded, shrunk, depressed, elated, happy, sad, you find it there.

657
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,000
In the same sense, you find the situation, you find it in that situation, it's found on

658
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,800
the base so that mindfulness, as everything else is, that's why mindfulness comes first,

659
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
there's the enlightenment factor.

660
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:08,440
We spoke recently about developing mind from ourselves, Chitanimity, whatever, I was also

661
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,800
thinking about what Chitanimity does, some part of perception and feeling, different

662
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
self-mind.

663
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:20,640
Just generally, how should that be understood as how it is today's experiment?

664
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,120
Well, if you would have the mind.

665
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,120
First you need to see the mind.

666
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:29,920
So if the mind is seen, then you can take that further, you can see what is this general

667
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,040
phenomenon, very general background, which you have discerning rightly as that background,

668
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,760
what does that further depend on?

669
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,040
And then you see it depends on the existence of the particular phenomenon of feeling and

670
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,160
the perception that simultaneously present, because without those things arisen, this

671
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,240
shape of the mind, this sort of attitude of the mind, this background, the mind would

672
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,320
not be developed at all, it's just inseparable from, you can't even conceive it separately.

673
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,040
You can just see when the mind means there has to be a feeling, there has to be a perception.

674
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:08,480
So is it something else, or can you just reduce it to feeling perception?

675
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,840
Feeling a perception as the base for the mind, yes.

676
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,800
And that mind is something else?

677
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,840
Well, yes, but not something else in the most elsewhere.

678
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:27,640
In the same sense, in the same sense, well, you can say feeling perception, feeling and

679
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,960
perception, that's what mind is.

680
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:40,880
So mind is not feeling, mind is not perception, feeling and perception, that's what mind is.

681
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,680
Because as you can see, there is no end to this background, really, it's infinite.

682
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,680
So you can see the feeling, you can see the perception, and you can see there is feeling

683
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,840
this perception, and that's another thing.

684
00:42:52,840 --> 00:43:02,520
Well, actually, it's infinite in a sense of stepping back, but in a sense of mind development,

685
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,720
you could surmount feeling and perception, and then the mind will cease, and that's the

686
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,680
creation of perception and feeling.

687
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,040
But that's reserved only for those who have arrived, you could specify that discernment

688
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,200
of that relationship, of that time, that depends on these things, feeling perception, that's

689
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,040
what mind is.

690
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,240
It kind of similar, and slightly lesser level, so it's with lower level, with what I said,

691
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,440
feeling perception, intention, are inseparable.

692
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,840
They cannot possibly occur without each other.

693
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,840
No one can be preconceived apart, but they're not the same thing.

694
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,840
And that intention is basically where the mind comes down, feeling perception, the mind,

695
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,840
or feeling perception, intention.

696
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:59,840
You have been back to this thing very far away, that's the thing that doesn't mean that

697
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,840
you see also yours, that thing back.

698
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,840
You could, because that can become part of it, yeah.

699
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,840
Because at the attitude that's present in your situation, that you intend it, because

700
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:14,840
you've been reading the Dharma and so on, and want to practice.

701
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:22,840
That's why, Vijya, like this destruction of our Vijya, or Arahantship, Nibhana, is

702
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,640
dependent upon, directly dependent upon practicing the Dharma.

703
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,840
It doesn't sound direct, but you can see in this sense, oh, it was because of you, directly

704
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,840
making intentions of stepping back and developing knowledge resulted in Arahantship.

705
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,840
It's because you went there, that's what Arahantship was.

706
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,840
So it's because of the contract and the Dharma.

707
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:50,840
You know, because that brings another issue, when I was listening to your talks, quite

708
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:57,840
clearly, it is that to become an area, it cannot happen by chance.

709
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:05,840
You must put the thread and practice correctly to happen, but it also brings the kind of

710
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,840
things, you know, when you have been practicing here for years and years, you think effort

711
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,840
and not actually realizing anything.

712
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
Yeah.

713
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,840
If the effort was right, you could have not realized it.

714
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,840
That's it.

715
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,840
So it's as simple as that.

716
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,840
So one cannot actually blame anyone.

717
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
Yeah, absolutely.

718
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,840
For as long as your life functioning with your faculties intact,

719
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,840
it's absolutely a new mentality.

720
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,840
And that's why, that's why, basically, the longer you do it, without the results,

721
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,840
you should be more concerned.

722
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840
Yes.

723
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Because you do what is probably not the right way, because I don't just still need

724
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,840
anything.

725
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,840
But then, yes, it's not an easy sort of thing to admit to yourself.

726
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Say, somebody's been sort of making up for 30, 40 years, and hasn't arrived at any sort

727
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,840
of distinction.

728
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:17,840
Like, 30 years, I mean, that's a lifetime of investment, of commitment and stuff.

729
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,840
And what you're going to do?

730
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,840
I'm going to scratch you and start from the beginning, or are you going to sort of

731
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:31,840
give in to the reputation, comfort, recognition, gain that you developed for the

732
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,840
30 years.

733
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,840
And then, sort of, just say, no, it's about this.

734
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,840
It's not about getting any of it.

735
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
It's not about developing distinction.

736
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,840
It's not about becoming sort of fun.

737
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,840
It's about just being here and now present for the mind, what not.

738
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,840
And that's what you hear from people.

739
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,840
But it also seems that, basically, the more you practice one day, more and more

740
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:57,840
difficult, to understand you, or to step to another kind of practice, because even

741
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:03,840
now I can see how hard it is actually to understand what we are talking about.

742
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,840
And I have been already listening for a few things this morning.

743
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,840
But you should also recognize that if you see even a little bit of value in what I'm

744
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,840
saying, that's already a big step forward.

745
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,840
That already means you already get some sense of the direction where I'm coming

746
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
from.

747
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,840
And most of the people just go over the head, just like, they either think, oh yeah,

748
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
of course, I wouldn't know that.

749
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,840
But they think, what are you talking about?

750
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
It makes completely no sense.

751
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,840
It's not about that.

752
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Which means it's either overly or underly sort of look for.

753
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,840
This never kind of can see that there are levels where it actually is.

754
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,840
So if you even have a faint notion of, there might be something there.

755
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,840
Well, that's already quite a big opening.

756
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,840
Obviously, it's up to you to make that feel like a huge, but if you don't do it,

757
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,840
then it's just going to step for stability for an opening.

758
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,840
But it's on the edge of the opening.

759
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,840
But yeah, of course, it's hard.

760
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,840
If it were easy, you wouldn't need to put it.

761
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
That's why the woman said to me like, it's because of...

762
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Anand said, no, it's so simple.

763
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
It's so clear to me.

764
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,840
Like, no, I can't say that.

765
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
It's because it's not.

766
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,840
It's so hard.

767
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,840
People remain bound for eons.

768
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,840
In eons, in eons, like countless eons of eons.

769
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,840
I kind of thinkable amount of time, just because of that.

770
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Just because they cannot discern their direction.

771
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,840
And it cannot be discerned by itself.

772
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,840
Because if you succeed it, you become some assembled.

773
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,840
And you can see how insane that is.

774
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,840
Like, you're incomprehensible.

775
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,840
That's what I call, who am I to praise the Buddha?

776
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Because they would realize the extent of somebody, like what they know,

777
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
because someone has a destruction.

778
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,840
If somebody finds that out by themselves.

779
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,840
How is that impossible?

780
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,840
It verges on the impossible.

781
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,840
But not quite.

782
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
And then somebody does it.

783
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,840
So you realize that it's just...

784
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
You can't even praise that.

785
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,840
This is beyond you.

786
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,840
And that's what's coming from the arrangements.

787
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,840
In the sutras, you would say, for who am I to praise the Buddha?

788
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,840
Because even with instruction, it's like,

789
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,840
virtually impossible for most people.

790
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,840
You've heard somebody finding that out for himself.

791
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,840
The extent of that effort.

792
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,840
And commitment and determination.

793
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,840
Yes.

794
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,840
Question in mind.

795
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,840
Mind is mano.

796
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,840
Mano.

797
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,840
There is a question in the beginning.

798
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,840
Right, as a sense.

799
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
Well, yeah.

800
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,840
Well, it's basically mano would be your reasoning.

801
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,840
You'll intellect your foreground of your thinking.

802
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,840
But you said also that it's like a Buddha.

803
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,840
Well, that's what Chita is.

804
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,840
That's what the Chita mind as Chita is.

805
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,840
Mano is, in the same sense, your eyes.

806
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,840
A foreground.

807
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,840
What you're thinking right away.

808
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,840
Which you're looking right away.

809
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,840
What you're smelling right away.

810
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,840
That's where mano is.

811
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,840
So you need to have mano discernment.

812
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,840
To point you in the direction to look beyond it.

813
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,840
Because you can have particular thoughts.

814
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,840
There's a scene in the general situation.

815
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,840
And the sight of the general situation.

816
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,840
The images of the general situation synchronically.

817
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,840
That's the level of Chita.

818
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,840
Those are the phenomena.

819
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,840
I see.

820
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,840
And I can be object to that.

821
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
That's what mine objects and mine are.

822
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,840
So if you need, in simple terms, think of,

823
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,840
mind as mano, think of that being like thoughts

824
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,840
to the concern with the five senses.

825
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,840
The thoughts are concerned with the background of it,

826
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,840
with the nature of it, with any of it.

827
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
The reflexive thoughts in regard to it,

828
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
they will not be the mano.

829
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,840
And it was abstract thoughts.

830
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,840
It depends.

831
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
Do they concern about sense of the mind?

832
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Sure.

833
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
They are not concerned with sense of the mind.

834
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,840
You are thinking about whatever.

835
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,840
Like something.

836
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Such as?

837
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
I don't know about nature of feelings.

838
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,840
Maybe or maybe about the nature of universe.

839
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,840
Well, you get something you will experience through senses.

840
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
Universe.

841
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,840
So you sense the mind.

842
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
Aha.

843
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,840
So you're thinking about the nature of it.

844
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,840
Then they will be like mano will be the actual thoughts

845
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,840
in regard to the sense of the mind.

846
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,840
But the nature of your reflection

847
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,840
upon that particular sense of the mind.

848
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,840
But you don't really have to worry about

849
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,840
much of a distinction between mano and chip and stuff.

850
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Only have to do just this on it.

851
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,840
So it seems that the most,

852
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
the essence is to learn this,

853
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,840
seeing things very fairly.

854
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,840
That will step back.

855
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,840
And not to be involved as particular.

856
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,840
Yeah.

857
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Not to disregard a particular idea,

858
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,840
but to learn how to see beyond it

859
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,840
while particularly present.

860
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
Yes.

861
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,840
So that's how you mind expands, literally.

862
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,840
Because mind is bound whatever you are looking at,

863
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
whatever you smell,

864
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,840
whatever occupies your attention that what people see.

865
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,840
Learning, while that's present to see,

866
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
well, beyond that,

867
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
simultaneously present,

868
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
while that is there,

869
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,840
may make some arm flicker, literally.

870
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,840
And how much you can do it, you know?

871
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
In that moment.

872
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,840
In that moment.

873
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,840
The growth can be indefinitely.

874
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,840
But you can do it to the extent necessary

875
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,840
for the final knowledge as Satyupadana took the sense.

876
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,840
Because I think that probably in the beginning,

877
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,840
it's only like when you remember it.

878
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,840
It's where you go here and there.

879
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,840
You just,

880
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,840
just being dried each time,

881
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,840
wherever something you arrive at.

882
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,840
And discerning that peripheral background correctly,

883
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,840
you can also,

884
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,840
you can also arrive at it with the,

885
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,840
by the recognition of the phenomenon of enduring,

886
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,840
often a reason thing,

887
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,840
or of the thing that's using enduring.

888
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,840
Because that means you kind of have to stay there with it,

889
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,840
but not fully particularly into it.

890
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,840
Because you have to see it changing,

891
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,840
while remaining the same.

892
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
You have to see it on two levels,

893
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
so to speak simultaneously present.

894
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,840
That's why you can approach it through that angle.

895
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
Like the three,

896
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,840
the three sort of aspects,

897
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,840
is a manifesto.

898
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,840
Or just the rising,

899
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,840
or just if,

900
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,840
or something said,

901
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,840
all there is a monk who is very proficient in,

902
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,840
in the rising.

903
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
It has enough for our entry.

904
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,840
All there is a monk who is very proficient in ceasing.

905
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,840
Why?

906
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,840
Because about changing,

907
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,840
in regard to rising,

908
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,840
to understand the full nature of independence of the aggregates

909
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,840
and everything into the possibility to only beneficial.

910
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,840
Or he uses positioning of changing

911
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,840
in regard to ceasing.

912
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,840
To understand fully nature of the aggregates,

913
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,840
and so on.

914
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Or he uses positioning of changing,

915
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,840
in regard to positioning of changing,

916
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,840
to fully understand the nature of the aggregates

917
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,840
and stuff of preicure kingdom,

918
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
becoming bent around.

919
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,840
Because ceasing is manifesto.

920
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,840
rising is manifesto.

921
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:05,840
It's not like ceasing in the actual cessation that you witness, a destruction of things.

922
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:12,840
Otherwise, if it's a destruction of a thing, then that's what's manifested. That's what has arisen.

923
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,840
You can see the destruction can take place only on a particular level.

924
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:24,840
I think being destroyed, I change in a shape. Still remaining a thing or change becoming a different thing because it's not.

925
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,840
It's not the same thing from before, but it's still a thing that came found in the situation.

926
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,840
In other words, it's not cessation, it's not missing the ending.

927
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:41,840
This means a different direction from arising, so to speak. Increasing or ceasing, either way, existing or changing.

928
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,840
But usually people just tend to quickly bond it together, cessation means ending.

929
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:52,840
So, yeah, I can see these branches falling down, trees breaking, everything is impermanent.

930
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:58,840
That experience has a reason for you. The experience of a tree being broken down.

931
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,840
That's what has arisen in your experience. So, it's actually arising here.

932
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,840
So, you basically look outside to just watch your experience.

933
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:13,840
And that's why we're creating a distinction saying, the impermanence that the Buddha was talking about

934
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,840
is impermanence that if understood, it's easy from suffering.

935
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:23,840
And the tree being destroyed makes no difference to it. Unless you're emotionally bound with those trees.

936
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:28,840
And then you suffer on cancer. But not because they're being destroyed, but because you're attached to them.

937
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Because the cause of suffering is not the destruction of things. The cause is your craving in regard to them.

938
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:40,840
So, you would still, even then, look at the wrong place. If you assume the cessation is a destruction.

939
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,840
So, a reception we could think of, for example, crispy. It's like sitting around.

940
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:52,840
It's okay, there's a situation that I find myself in.

941
00:55:52,840 --> 00:56:01,840
And within that, there is also a thought of the body anyway, even just the basic on there is the body.

942
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:12,840
And if you understand, firstly, the nature of matter, of consciousness, basically that, you know, they're beneath your feet paired with each other,

943
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,840
you know, saying them whatsoever and that everything is an entire situation arose because of that.

944
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,840
Sure.

945
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,840
Because all you can have is thoughts, imagines, damas.

946
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,840
That's exactly what things are.

947
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:32,840
So, you can also just, in the, let's say you're mindful of the situation properly, or at least sort of sufficiently.

948
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:39,840
If you have a thought like, oh, this body is there, well, see where that thought is directed. What is it aiming at?

949
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,840
What is it referring to?

950
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,840
What is that that you're trying to designate by that thought?

951
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,840
Because that's often like done player for people. And then you just end up carrying on the assumption

952
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:55,840
that they were completely gratuitous to begin with. But because you never looked at their gratuitous, you keep keeping them.

953
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,840
You keep maintaining them.

954
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:02,840
So, like when you say, all these bodies, well, what am I referring to specifically?

955
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:09,840
They were referring to the bit that I see with my eyes, where I feel this feeling of touch of the chair and the table I'm leaning on, or the age,

956
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:14,840
or feel that they refer to the heat, or the energy, or whatever, what am I referring to?

957
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,840
And just find out what you're referring to in the general situation. What is this being directed at when I say?

958
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:27,840
Because it has to be directed upon something, because if this thing hasn't been a reason at all, you wouldn't be able to call it in any terms.

959
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:36,840
But the failure you can call it, sometimes means you are having some sort of notion of it. That's why it is possible to step back properly.

960
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:42,840
And then this one, because the aggregates are there.

961
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Theoretically, then, any kind of thing you're referring to, so let me just understand that the actual matter of the body is not that which you are pointing to could be taken sufficiently to say this is the body.

962
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,840
Sort of, say it again.

963
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,840
Which means any method you're referring to?

964
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:07,840
No, like, as long as you understand that whatever you're delegating, that body is not the matter of the body.

965
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:13,840
Right, right, right, right, yeah, because what people think, what they're doing is...
