1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,880
So how can you go back as well, not being, not distracting yourself all the time in a way that

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,080
it says there and the Buddha says he doesn't intend on waiting for this.

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:39,080
So you're not holding on to your wakefulness, you're basically intent on not losing it and how you lose it, you lose it by giving into a non-wakeful intention.

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,080
So you cannot accidentally lose your wakefulness.

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:51,080
So even lapsing in terms of your thoughts or similar, it's not necessarily you lost wakefulness.

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:58,080
You lose wakefulness when you intentionally give into distraction or lust or anger and aversion.

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:08,080
So that's why in relation to the previous, well one of the previous talks was to keep questioning yourself, your motivation so that your own intentions can become transparent and clear.

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Because you will know even if sometimes people say I'm engaged with spreading the dhamma but they're doing it, their intentions are rooted in the desire for distraction.

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:27,080
Desire for saying something to do, giving this worldly purpose to my life because otherwise just boredom and anxiety sets in and it's too much to handle.

10
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,080
And in that case that's not the dhamma.

11
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Although you might be actually parroting the Buddha's words and publishing the Buddha's words, it's not the actual dhamma which is always non aversion, non greed, non aversion, non delusion, non distraction, wakefulness and knowledge.

12
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:58,080
They're only thinking and not being able to just relax.

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:12,080
They start discerning your intentions and then just you don't have to, and that's the problem when people don't discerning intentions, they tend to either indulge them all or dismiss them all because they don't see anything in between.

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,080
If a person starts discerning their own motivation, their own intentions, then you know actually these intentions are not rooted in greed, nor aversion of delusion.

15
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:30,080
No problem, that's how you get relaxed. So only you have to abandon those that are rooted in desire for distraction, desire for centrality, desire for aversion and so on.

16
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:41,080
That's why when you're coming from just relaxing into greed or what you say, relaxing into delusion, that's all you know.

17
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
I don't know this other way of relaxing.

18
00:02:44,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Initially the only notion of relaxation is relaxation of distraction that you have, but that's yeah, that type of relaxation needs to be abandoned because it's not relaxation really.

19
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Or you can call it relaxation but it's not peace because you fully control by it and fully dependent upon it.

20
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Like watching a movie. Sure says, come all the sounds, sites, last one, bend, bend.

21
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:34,080
And basically you're out through your senses, you might not necessarily be actively pursuing the full-on central pleasures, but it's still bound with site sounds, melt taste touches, which means it's still within the central domain.

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:42,080
That's why it's not just you have to abandon the obvious course centrality, you also have to abandon distraction that you've been gaining through your senses.

23
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,080
But when I say abandoned, doesn't mean you obliterate any notion of your senses and deny it.

24
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:56,080
I just mean make sure that if you are engaging, that motivation, the intentions behind that engagement is not rooted.

25
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:04,080
In greed, aversion delusion, which is basically delusion equals wanting distraction.

26
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Non-waitfulness.

27
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,080
That's it, all of those would contribute to non-waitfulness.

28
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,080
So that's it. And then automatically, if it's not those, then it's automatically wakefulness.

29
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,080
That's why you're not doing the wakefulness.

30
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,080
You're developing it basically by preventing non-waitfulness to overwhelm you.

31
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Like intention or it to give into it. So you prevent that and then you're automatically wakefulness.

32
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,080
You're in becomes effortless.

33
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Exactly, because you're not doing it. It's not a method or something to uphold constantly every second of your life.

34
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,080
That's how you get truly relaxed, truly peaceful, because it's effortless.

35
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:48,080
It takes effort to give in to intentions, to do things upon them, be central or non-central.

36
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,080
But if you, all you do is just abstain from the effort of engaging with centrality, aversion, distraction,

37
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:03,080
then your experience is automatically effortless and wakeful.

38
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:18,080
And then within that, well, you'll know exactly what to do if you get to that point.
