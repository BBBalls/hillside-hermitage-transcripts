1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,080
So you've been seeing many times that the problem

2
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:41,080
is that we are affected in the first place, in other words we are we are

3
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,080
anger is possible, lust is possible, we can get confused.

4
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Suffering is possible for us.

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:06,080
So the goal is to not be affected in the first place, not to do something on a counter.

6
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Well, that's the kind of fundamental difference that I often try to highlight.

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:24,080
The practice of dharma is not supposed to just help you with things, help you with things that bother you, help you deal with them.

8
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,080
It's basically supposed to approach your liability to it, to things that bother you.

9
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:40,080
So it doesn't manage your suffering, it removes possibility for you to suffer in the first place.

10
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:51,080
So that's a personal goal for your practice, it should be I don't want to be affected by things to begin with.

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Not I want to have a perfect management technique that will always help me deal with whatever suffering has arisen.

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,080
See, that's the problem already, suffering has arisen.

13
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,080
You might be very skilled in dealing with it, but you're not skilled in not having it arise in the first place.

14
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,080
And that's what should be your issue.

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:22,080
So that's why even in the Buddha would often describe his teaching, the freeze you from suffering brings cessation of being.

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:31,080
The ending of bhava, the ending of all these things becoming for you, manifesting and during that you have to manage them later.

17
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Means they're not anymore, being deceased, they're gone.

18
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:43,080
So that is the goal of the dhamma, cessation of being, not management of things that are for you here and now.

19
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:53,080
The cessation of suffering, cessation of greed, diversion, delusion.

20
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:04,080
So I can get angry, I can get angry, but then I can find out some sort of technique to manage my anger.

21
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Yeah, when you're going to angry think these thoughts.

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,080
When you're angry do this, when you're angry do that.

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
That's how you start.

24
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,080
You need to be, well you need to want to be free from anger to begin with.

25
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:26,080
And then inevitably your first effort will be directed at how to manage and subdue the anger.

26
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,080
But you mustn't confuse that for the actual practice of the dhamma, which if done rightly will uproot the anger.

27
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
And then it's nothing for you to manage.

28
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,080
No burden for you to have to do or deal with and if you don't do it you will then suffer.

29
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:48,080
No, there is nothing to be dealt with because nothing affects you to begin with.

30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
You say it's not the dhamma, that management is not the dhamma.

31
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Exactly, it's like the approximation of the dhamma.

32
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:04,080
It's not the direct way, one way only, the way the Buddha would describe the dhamma would always only result in purification of being.

33
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Removing all the unwholesomeness and making bhava cease.

34
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Management doesn't do that.

35
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Only that direct insight into what approves suffering, what is uprooting the greed, what is uprooting the aversion and delusion.

36
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
So what is the dhamma?

37
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Is that direct path for uprooting, nor to the management.

38
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,080
So you are kind of responsible for whether things you're doing, whether you've taken them as dhamma,

39
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:48,080
whether you've taken them for the purpose of uprooting the issues, not dealing with it, but making yourself not liable to them even in the future.

40
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Or have you taken the dhamma instruction as a means of helping yourself deal with these things.

41
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:10,080
So it's determined by you, by your attitude, whether that instruction will be taken as the dhamma or as management.

42
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
That's the difference I'm pointing at.

43
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,080
You know, like you can do satipatana, which is the dhamma, the way the Buddha described, but you can do it for the reasons of managing your suffering,

44
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,080
not for the reasons of uprooting it.

45
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Which means you are responsible for whether it's management or it's the dhamma.

46
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
And yeah, that's why the dhamma arises in those who see.

47
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,080
You can tell the dhamma directly that the Buddha would teach the dhamma to somebody, but he wouldn't be the dhamma for them because they're not understanding it.

48
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
So there is no rising of dhamma in their experience.

49
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
But he is the thing that Buddha said, but they're not understanding it.

50
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
So the dhamma can only arise on that individual level.

51
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,080
There's dhamma, the way, knowing the knowledge of the way.

52
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,080
The knowledge of the way of uprooting things, basically, that's what it is.

53
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,080
The knowledge of overcoming liability to suffering once and for all, not just the knowledge of how to manage it skillfully when it arises.

54
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:22,080
See, you can look and see, I am subject to suffering.

55
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,080
I will. Things can go wrong.

56
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Well, exactly. It's really on that level of I will.

57
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,080
I will experience this. I am liable to this.

58
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,080
That's, we often say that, that's what we say, the wise man will reflect.

59
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
The young man who leaves the home, I am prey to suffering.

60
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,080
It's not necessarily suffering now, but the suffering will catch me at some point.

61
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
It's inevitable.

62
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:56,080
And you should have the, like, mental, basically, clarity enough, mental capacity sufficiently enough to start seeing that as the actual root of the problem.

63
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:05,080
Now, the fact that you might, like, well, I suffer now, I don't suffer tomorrow, or whatever, the fact that I will at some point, it's inevitable, and that's the true problem.

64
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Even if I spend the rest of my life skillfully avoiding all the major suffering, the fact is, it will still have to, I am still liable to it.

65
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,080
I still have to make the effort to avoid it. That's already the issue.

66
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,080
The divine messenger, you know, the Buddha was neither sick nor old nor dying when he saw sick, aging, dead person.

67
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:34,080
So you see that, ah, this is directly present in my experience as the inherent liability.

68
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
And that's where the issue is.

69
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:49,080
And that's where the difference in practice of management and the practice of uprooting, let's call it that way, is basically in recognizing, like, okay, so there is no lust in my experience here and now.

70
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,080
There is no greed in my experience here and now, there is no delusion in my experience here and, okay, I find that.

71
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,080
No, but now, as the Buddha would say, okay, so you ask yourself further.

72
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:10,080
It's good that those things are not present here and now, but your next question should now be, so is it possible for no reason lost to arise later on?

73
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Now it's not here, but can it be here tomorrow? Oh, have I addressed that?

74
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Here and now, not wait for tomorrow to address it.

75
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,080
And that's literally the crossroads between, are you heading in the direction of uprooting it?

76
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Or are you heading in the direction of management?

77
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:40,080
And most people go down the path of management, as in, I'll deal with it when it arises, failing to understand that liability to future lust is a reason issue now.

78
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:50,080
You don't have to wait for it to arise. Is there a chance for non-manifested lust, non-manifested aversion to manifest in my experience later?

79
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,080
If you're not sure, means that is a chance. If you know for sure, there you go, you confirm that.

80
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,080
So there is a chance that these things will arise. That's the issue for me now when those things are not present.

81
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Anger is a possibility for anger, is a problem. No, not in the future. It is now a problem.

82
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:23,080
And that's the whole, that's like the, what differentiates your practice from, are you aiming at the uprooting, or are you just aiming at the skillful management?

83
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:34,080
And you heard that yourself before, it's very common attitude of, oh well, you know, most of the time you are not lustful, most of the time you're not angry.

84
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:42,080
So see, you're doing fine. If most of the time you're not angry means anger is still your liability, your possibility.

85
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Which means you're as angry. Like, yeah, you're not acting out of that anger as often as others, but that's just because you learn some management of your anger.

86
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:58,080
You're certainly not uprooting anything if you have the attitude that most of the time these things don't arise for me.

87
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Yeah, but could they arise at any time? Yes, that's the issue you're not seeing and that's why you're not uprooting anything.

88
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:19,080
So you see that there is a problem because you see and know that there is the possibility of anger.

89
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,080
So you have to train your mind to start seeing these possibilities as actually present because they are.

90
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:34,080
So you can think to yourself, I can manage my lust or my anger quite well. I'm ready to skill with that.

91
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:44,080
I know all these different techniques, psychological methods to employ so that I can ease that anger, ease that lust and become again.

92
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:51,080
If your way out of suffering is skillful managing it, you need suffering to arise first.

93
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:58,080
So management requires suffering in order to manage it. So management cannot free you from that suffering.

94
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:09,080
You can only deal with it once it has arisen. And most people, that's the kind of problem that sort of relatively subtle, I suppose, is people, as I said,

95
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:16,080
natural tendencies to turn towards management first. I'll take it, get rid of the problem, do it skillfully, whatever else.

96
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,080
But there is this kind of conflating that occurs then, or rather confusion.

97
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:28,080
So through your management of suffering, you experience like less dukkha.

98
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:41,080
And then at the same time, you kind of start basically tacitly assuming, hoping that all you have to do is manage your suffering long enough,

99
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,080
and then somehow magically, liability to dukkha will disappear.

100
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,080
So all you have to do is adhere to this management and skillful avoiding and so on.

101
00:11:51,080 --> 00:12:00,080
And there's already implicit, as I said, wishful thinking, that implies that you hope for suffering will then just poof eventually.

102
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,080
From your management, it will just evaporate. But it won't. That's the point.

103
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,080
The only way that suffering will evaporate is if you evaporate it.

104
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,080
If you understand the core, pull the thorn out.

105
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:20,080
It won't come out by itself. So uproot it.

106
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:29,080
So if you keep managing it with a hope that somehow it will disappear on the level of that, I am still liable to it,

107
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,080
means your practice revolves around wishful thinking.

108
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,080
There is no direct insight. This is what to be done for freedom from suffering.

109
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Because everybody wants to be fully free from suffering, which means everybody wants to not even be liable to discomfort and displeasure.

110
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:59,080
So I start doing meta, meta, meta, meta, meta, every day, every day. And I stay calm. I don't get angry.

111
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:11,080
But I have to keep doing meta because I can. So your calmness then is dependent upon the factor of you sustaining your effort towards whatever you perceive meta contemplation to be,

112
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,080
which means if sometimes circumstances change, you get sick or something happens or too many things happen, you don't have enough time.

113
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:26,080
So you cannot engage to that necessary extent of your meta contemplation, means you're back within anger.

114
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:33,080
So you haven't really uprooted anger. You just suppressed it with a certain practices.

115
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:39,080
And as I said, it's not inherently wrong to do that, to begin with.

116
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:45,080
But it's inherently wrong to adopt a view that doing that approves things somehow magically.

117
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:51,080
The only way to approve things is to directly see what uprooting is. And I just described it what it is.

118
00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:04,080
It's recognizing that liability, the possibility of anger, possibility of ill will, possibility of sensuality, possibility of delusion, possibility of dukkha as the dukkha right now.

119
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Not to wait for it when it occurs.

120
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:24,080
So you can see that possibility, see that possibility. So what do you do? How do you uproot this possibility that tomorrow you might suffer?

121
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Well, it's sustaining that. So can you sustain that if you're not keeping the precepts?

122
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Can you sustain that elevated state of mind that recognizes liability to dukkha without the actual dukkha being present there?

123
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:43,080
If you're drinking, smoking, running around, distracting yourself, engaging in entertainment, no, impossible.

124
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:49,080
So that the noble eightfold path, that's how you do it. Right livelihood, right view first, first of all.

125
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:57,080
See, if your view is still regards management as the way out of suffering, you will not stay on the level of weight.

126
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:04,080
It's the possibility of suffering that's the problem there must be dealt, not the actual suffering when it arises.

127
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,080
So again, how do I deal with that? How do you deal with what? The possibility.

128
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:17,080
But noble eightfold path. So right view, knowing that that's where the issue is, not looking elsewhere, right intentions,

129
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:25,080
not entertaining, not delighting, not giving in to create a version of delusion through your speech, through your body, in your thoughts.

130
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:34,080
So on every front, you need to build yourself up in order to be able to sustain that recognition of liability here and now it's what the issue is.

131
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:43,080
If you ask yourself, how do I deal with the possibility of future suffering here and now, you're basically asking how do I manage it?

132
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,080
How do I manage this possibility?

133
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Well, that's what you're implying, because you want to deal with it now.

134
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:56,080
You deal with it properly, not give in to the view of management by realizing that you have no right to resist it.

135
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,080
So you have to be careful when you start recognizing, the liability of suffering is the problem for me.

136
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,080
You have to be careful to now not give in to the attitude of wanting to manage that.

137
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:15,080
So I want it to end. I want that possibility to be gone.

138
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:21,080
So then you really have to understand where the dukkha is there.

139
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Is the possibility in itself dukkha?

140
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Is that possibility of future discomfort, future disagreeable things?

141
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Is that in itself dukkha?

142
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
The idea.

143
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Yeah, the thought of it. Is that the dukkha?

144
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
No.

145
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
So what's the dukkha then?

146
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:49,080
I would say it's that unpleasant feeling. It's the displeasure that is there when I have that idea.

147
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Right.

148
00:16:50,080 --> 00:17:02,080
So I feel uncomfortable with the fact that in the future, I will suffer pain, which I'm suffering presently because of that.

149
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:13,080
So then the next question you should ask yourself, is the unpleasant feeling then that you have when you think those thoughts?

150
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Is that the dukkha in itself?

151
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
No, no.

152
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Because it is what it is, that pain.

153
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Well, yeah.

154
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
The problem is I don't want it there.

155
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,080
So what is then the dukkha?

156
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,080
I mean, I would say, okay, it's the craving to get rid of it.

157
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Okay. So how is that manifested? What is that?

158
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Practically in your experience.

159
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Resist.

160
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
So, yeah.

161
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
I resisted.

162
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,080
So that's something that is entitled of, I should not have this.

163
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:52,080
So you realize you suffer because you resist discomfort even before the discomfort comes your way.

164
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,080
See, you resist the thought of the possibility of discomfort here and now, and that's why here and now you experience dukkha.

165
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,080
That's why the Buddha didn't say, Vedana is the cause of dukkha.

166
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,080
He didn't say feelings are the cause of suffering.

167
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,080
He said, Tanha, craving is the cause of suffering, craving in regard to what you feel.

168
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:24,080
So you have such and such feeling when you have such and such thought, present, future or past, but it's your implicit attitude towards the feeling of either craving towards it or away from it.

169
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,080
That's why that experience is dukkha.

170
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:37,080
And see, you would have not seen that if you haven't forced yourself to discern the level of that possibility of dukkha is dukkha right now.

171
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:47,080
You wouldn't have seen that if you were just fully bent on managing the dukkha as it arises or managing the dukkha before it arises.

172
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Yeah, so that's what I mean, even when people recognize sometimes the future dukkha, liability to the future dukkha, they can even take that as something to manage.

173
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,080
So I'll do this, I'll do this, so these things will not happen to me.

174
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Which carries the implicit view that dukkha is in those actual things or in your actual feelings, and you don't see that it's in your attitude towards these things.

175
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Right here, right now, always present, exactly, always present.

176
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:26,080
The relationship between dukkha and dukkha between craving and suffering is always present, always simultaneously present.

177
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Presence of suffering means presence of tana.

178
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Presence of tana means presence of suffering.

179
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,080
So to the extent that tana is present, to that extent suffering is felt.

180
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Or to the extent that suffering is felt, to that extent, attitude of tana is present.

181
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,080
There is no delay, or like a few seconds later, dukkha comes as a result of your craving.

182
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Now, presence of suffering means presence of craving, presence of suffering.

183
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:12,080
So that's why if you were to remove the presence of craving, there is no suffering amidst things that used to cause you to suffer so much.

184
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,080
And that's why liberation is visible and possible from suffering here and now.

185
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:30,080
I mean, you need to start seeing as dukkha the liability to suffering, not actually wait for the actual suffering and then manage it.

186
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Because if you don't see that liability, then you're complacent.

187
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,080
If you're not seeing the liability, means you are not seeing where your craving is.

188
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
No, you're not seeing dukkha. You're not seeing dukkha.

189
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,080
You need to see the dukkha first in order to see the cause of dukkha. You can't just be dealing with the dukkha without understanding what dukkha is.

190
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,080
That's what I said. I am teaching suffering and I'm teaching freedom.

191
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm teaching only two things suffering and freedom from it. That's it.

192
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:04,080
So if you don't see that possibility of future discomfort is already dukkha now, means you're not seeing the nature of dukkha to begin with.

193
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:15,080
So does matter what happens to you, you will not see it with the correct set of eyes, so to speak.

194
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:22,080
And if you're not seeing what the dukkha is here and now, already, you're not going to see your craving.

195
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Because as I said, to the extent that the dukkha is felt, to that extent, craving is present.

196
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,080
But you're not seeing the felt dukkha, thus how can you see that, which determines it, the actual craving.

197
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:40,080
So that's what I mean. Management, looking to deal with it over there without seeing where the actual dukkha is.

198
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Because you give in to that need to manage it and remove the pain, as opposed to understand it.

199
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,080
It's inherently bound in the wrong view. It's inherently bound in the wrong direction.

200
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,080
It's just like a way you could reflect. Why are you entitled to manage pain?

201
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Have you had to say, well, on the nature of that dukkha, even the actual dukkha or the future dukkha?

202
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Just reflect. Have you had to say, and it's arising?

203
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Can you prevent circumstances from becoming disagreeable at any point in the future?

204
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Is that even conceivable, actually? It's just a pure fantasy.

205
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Fantasy rooted in this complete misconceiving of the problem.

206
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Problem is in these things happening to me. Problem is not in me implicitly resisting the idea of these things happening to me.

207
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,080
So how do you stop resisting the pain?

208
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,080
How do you then stop craving or rather welcoming the pleasure?

209
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,080
How do you remove craving? Well, we just outlined it.

210
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:53,080
By not trying to manage it, by seeing it here and now already.

211
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,080
And then by sensory strength, because you cannot possibly be welcoming pleasure

212
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,080
and then just dealing with the unpleasant experiences when they arise.

213
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,080
You can't just selectively pick and choose which cravings you want.

214
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,080
If there is any form of craving present, means liability to suffering is present.

215
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,080
So you have to abandon craving for pleasure, inasmuch you have to abandon craving against pain.

216
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,080
So pain comes, pleasure comes. You are not saying it's arising.

217
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:29,080
So why do you then constantly entertain the attitude of, I want this, I don't want this.

218
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,080
I write to want this, I write to not want this.

219
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Why do you go after one and try to avoid the other one?

220
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Where is your attitude rooted? Why are you doing it?

221
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Because if pleasure and pain is felt, it's a pressure, you feel the pain.

222
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,080
So it's painful to not do it. So you do it because you want to avoid pain.

223
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Because it's pressure and pain is pressure.

224
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,080
So you don't know how to deal with Duka, thus you try to get rid of Duka.

225
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,080
That's basically the nutshell of every management.

226
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,080
And that's why it's inherently wrong.

227
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Even if you're doing the Dama, all the Buddha's instructions, but you're taking them as management,

228
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,080
means you still entertain the same attitude because of which you suffer in the first place.

229
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Which is, I can handle this, I want to get rid of it.

230
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Which is the attitude of craving.

231
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:37,080
So how can you then withstand the pressure?

232
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,080
But can you withstand the pressure if even your physical behavior is not kept in check?

233
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Can you withstand mental pressure then? Impossible.

234
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,080
If your verbal behavior is not kept in check, like the outposts of lust and anger

235
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,080
through your physical action, through your verbal action, if you don't keep a lid on that,

236
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,080
can you possibly withstand things mentally? Not a chance.

237
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,080
And how do you do that by doing it? Like how do you become stronger?

238
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Well, by exposing yourself to things, they will make you stronger, by training.

239
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,080
I said that many times, like even when I first read that I saw it as I was a bit puzzled,

240
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,080
but it keeps talking about he trains himself, thus.

241
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,080
A monk, skilled monk trains himself, thus.

242
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Because you know, you had all these notions about enlightenment, and then someone's like,

243
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,080
what is there to train? You know, you do things and then enlightenment happens to you.

244
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,080
No, you train the strength out of which wisdom comes, which is what enlightenment is.

245
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,080
So that's where sensory strain is not optional.

246
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,080
That's where virtue is not, you know, I can do it for a while.

247
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,080
It's a necessary basis that has to remain throughout.

248
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,080
So you will be able to withstand the pressure by not giving into pressure.

249
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,080
By not giving into pressure, you get to outline what the actual problem is.

250
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Your liability to future pressure, to future discomfort, is already the problem right here right now.

251
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:11,080
And you see that now, because you haven't just blindly gave in to managing of the pressure in order to get rid of the pressure.

252
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Manage the stress in order to get rid of the stress.

253
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,080
Practice the dama so you don't get this particular stress anymore.

254
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,080
I recognize that there's a possibility of suffering.

255
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,080
And I see that suffering right now.

256
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,080
It's suffering because I resist the displeasure here and now in regard to the possibility.

257
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,080
It's suffering because I resist.

258
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:44,080
So I don't resist that discomfort here and now.

259
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,080
But I must have that, I must still have that idea.

260
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,080
I don't have to keep on thinking about that there's a possibility of me suffering tomorrow.

261
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:02,080
No, they will come and go.

262
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,080
So whatever, basically I have to look at whatever I'm feeling right now.

263
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Yeah, because that's where the resistance occurs.

264
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
That's where craving is. It's where you feel.

265
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Yeah, I can put the possibility of suffering. I put that aside.

266
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Because now I know what the problem is here and now.

267
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Sure, sure.

268
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
I've come to that.

269
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,080
You start right? You contemplate the possibility of suffering when you forget what the problem is here and now.

270
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Or were you not seeing it?

271
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Yeah, like Sari Puta, just ask himself. I think it was Sari Puta.

272
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,080
What am I liable to anything to any suffering?

273
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Yeah, it was something like that.

274
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Is there any suffering that can arise?

275
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Yeah, is there any suffering that hasn't, that the possibility of suffering hasn't been addressed, so to speak?

276
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Yeah.

277
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
And he's like, no, I don't see any. Okay.

278
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,080
He still doesn't decide, okay, I'm done now.

279
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,080
No, you remain with that vigilant attitude.

280
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,080
So you don't miss, okay? I'll check in every now and then and see if something has changed.

281
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,080
If possibility for lust, aversion, delusion, possibility for pressure,

282
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,080
possibility for central pull, possibility for suffering,

283
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,080
has that arisen now? Not the actual suffering, but the possibility for it being,

284
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,080
oh, look, yeah, now I see it, yeah, it could, it's possible.

285
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,080
There you go, that's your issue, right there and then.

286
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
So what do you do?

287
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Well, you don't lose the sight of it to begin with.

288
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
But feeling.

289
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Yeah.

290
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,080
You don't welcome it if it's the possibility towards pleasure and sensuality,

291
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,080
and you don't resist it if it's the possibility towards pain and discomfort.

292
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,080
Is there anything that, is it a possibility for me?

293
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,080
Indulging in welcoming.

294
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Indulging is too coarse already.

295
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
It's a pleasure in the future.

296
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Exactly.

297
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,080
So it's on the level of the possibility of pleasure or possibility of pain,

298
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,080
which means on the level of welcoming or kind of shying away from itself.

299
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,080
So I think if someone brings me a pizza tomorrow,

300
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,080
I love the taste of pizza, will I, will I welcome a taste of vegetable taste?

301
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Will I get lost?

302
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,080
And you will know that, if you're looking at things rightly,

303
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
you will know that already now.

304
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
You'll know.

305
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Oh, I can't wait.

306
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Even if you are perfectly restrained and don't express your joy over the particular type of food brought to you,

307
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,080
you already internally, you know what it is.

308
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,080
And so that, that's the problem.

309
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
And but there's the work.

310
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
And that's the work, except that's where the issue is.

311
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,080
And people would, okay, so I will tell them never to bring that thing again,

312
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
because I like it too much.

313
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,080
It's like, well, you can do that as a way of like, if you really can't deal with things,

314
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
okay, put it aside.

315
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,080
But that's really masking the issue.

316
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,080
The issue is not the pizza or whatever people have brought to you.

317
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,080
The issue is you're unable to restrain yourself.

318
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,080
You're unable to have mind free from greed.

319
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,080
So now you're just trying to remove things that make you greedy.

320
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,080
You're unable to not be wanting pleasure.

321
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,080
You are unable to not welcome that pressure of that pleasure.

322
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,080
You're unable, which means that's where you will remain liable.

323
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
You can spend 100 years of that management.

324
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
You will never approve your centrality.

325
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,080
So you feel the pressure of pain, the resistance against it, and you stop.

326
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,080
Well, exactly. You don't try to get rid of it.

327
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,080
You don't try to psychologize, manage, explain, prevent things from arising.

328
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Obviously, if something obviously unwholesome, like when that man came and wanted to offer

329
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,080
his daughter to the Buddha, and he said, no, don't even bother.

330
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I will not accept that.

331
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,080
Like certain things cannot be done rightly, such as sexual intercourse and so on.

332
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,080
But there are things that there's nothing wrong in eating food,

333
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
whether it stays still or not.

334
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,080
But it's wrong in eating it with central reasons.

335
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:04,080
And you eat your food with central reasons when you are unable to not be overwhelmed

336
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:12,080
by that pressure towards accepting pleasure.

337
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,080
I would say when you practice in regard to the food, not like you stop eating.

338
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
No, you eat mindfully.

339
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,080
You maintain the reasons for your eating clearly, and you eat one of those reasons at present,

340
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,080
reasons for health, sustaining the body, so that you can practice further,

341
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
not the reasons of your beautification, chasing the taste, and so on.

342
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,080
But if you just think, if I avoid the food, I don't have to deal with these reasons,

343
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
well, you're sorely mistaken.

344
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,080
You're just covering up the basis of your centrality.

345
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,080
So even if you just eat horrible stuff all the time,

346
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,080
because you don't want to experience any sensual joy of the taste,

347
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,080
you still need to look at these reasons and keep the vigilant eye on them,

348
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,080
because that's where sensuality is rooted, not in the actual taste.

349
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,080
So am I welcoming?

350
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Am I delighting?

351
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Am I accepting this elation on account of central prospect

352
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
that is pleasing to me?

353
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
That's the issue.

354
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,080
My acceptance, not seeing the danger in it.

355
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Not that's the issue.

356
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Not the issue.

357
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Oh, I must not have this thing.

358
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,080
Arise for me at all.

359
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Call people, tell them never to bring their food, never to connect.

360
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,080
You'll never see anything, you'll never hear anything, you'll never taste anything, agree.

361
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,080
And you're not, you're misconceiving where the issue is.

362
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
And you maintain the issue.

363
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
Well, you remain fully within it.

364
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,080
That's why you're not stepping outside of central domains.

365
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
There might be someone who comes along.

366
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,080
And that's where the asceticism, the art must form, like giants,

367
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,080
the perfect practice of obsessive hingsa, non-violence,

368
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
not eating, not harming, anything.

369
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,080
It's utterly misguided, because it's fully misprojected.

370
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,080
They don't see where the issue really is.

371
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,080
You know, avoiding food, any food, just eating every third day

372
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,080
and to the point of in the end, you die on a kind of starvation.

373
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
And that's like the ultimate goal of a giant.

374
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Yet you realise you fully remain bound by the central domain.

375
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
Never a step closer to escape it.

376
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:24,080
It was the giants that said that, by avoiding things,

377
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,080
then you diminish the pressure.

378
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,080
But where's the Buddhist ways?

379
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,080
What? Because it's not always the same things.

380
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,080
You don't always have one attitude towards all things.

381
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,080
If you were to only have the attitude of accepting everything,

382
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,080
every type of feeling, every type of perception,

383
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
then giants would have been right.

384
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,080
All you need to do is avoid it, because you always accept it.

385
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
But that's not the case.

386
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,080
You're not accepting the unpleasurable feelings.

387
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,080
You are actually trying to get rid of them.

388
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
You're only accepting certain things.

389
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,080
But then you're resisting some other things.

390
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
And so it's not a blanket rule.

391
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,080
Always avoid, because it's not a blanket experience.

392
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
That's always the same.

393
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,080
That's why what you do, whether you avoid,

394
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
or whether you have to basically endure,

395
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
is determined by how you feel.

396
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,080
And you don't even feel there's always the same in regard to the same things.

397
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Sometimes one same food might make you happy.

398
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Sometimes it might make you unpleasant.

399
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Sometimes it might make you indifferent,

400
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,080
which means you have three different types of attitude

401
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
that will then exhibit the craving.

402
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,080
But if you always avoid everything,

403
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,080
you're ignoring two-thirds of that picture,

404
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,080
and that's why you will remain ignorant.

405
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,080
So how can you then know when to reject and when to accept?

406
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
Like when you're resisting,

407
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,080
you're seriously the future prospect of suffering.

408
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,080
Should you be rejecting that even more?

409
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
No.

410
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,080
You need to accept that these possibilities are there present

411
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
and you have no say in it.

412
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,080
That's how you can then stop resisting it continuously

413
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
and thus you approve the suffering.

414
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Or should you then accept the prospect of future pleasure

415
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
that you had already delighted in it?

416
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
No, you must reject it.

417
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
You must contemplate the danger in it.

418
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
So how do you know what you do?

419
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
Well, by learning how to be properly mindful

420
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
of an enduring feeling,

421
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
because that's where things converge.

422
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,080
That's where things are rooted.

423
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
You can't just take a set of behavior.

424
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,080
I always do this when it's this and this when it's that.

425
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
No.

426
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
First, you just need to remain mindful

427
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
of what's the present enduring feeling

428
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,080
and you will know then what attitude is there.

429
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,080
If the present enduring feeling is of pleasure

430
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,080
and agreeability means you have the attitude of welcoming it.

431
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
By default.

432
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
But you must.

433
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
So that's what you reject.

434
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,080
You reject your welcoming of this central pleasure.

435
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
You don't blame, like giants,

436
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,080
the actual object of your central pleasure.

437
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,080
So you will know what attitude is there

438
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,080
by correctly understanding what present feeling is there.

439
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
That's the root of the problem.

440
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
It's always present.

441
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
The root of the problem is always present.

442
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
It's not in the past.

443
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
It will not be in the future.

444
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
That's the root of the problem.

445
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Exactly.

446
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
And the root of that present root is basically your attitude

447
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
towards the present enduring feeling.

448
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,080
So it's whatever suffering will arise in the future is always.

449
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
That's the gateway.

450
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
It's within that.

451
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
That doesn't disappear when the suffering arise.

452
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
That remains.

453
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
It's vessel, so to speak.

454
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,080
It's framework, as I say.

455
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Because no matter future discomfort and suffering can affect you

456
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,080
unless you're holding on to that vessel of rejecting it.

457
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,080
But the vessel of rejection, basically, of any discomfort.

458
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
That's your mindset.

459
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,080
So anything that comes of discomfort on nature is going to make you suffer

460
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,080
because of your attitude of not wanting it.

461
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
You remove the attitude of that,

462
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,080
the attitude of not wanting that discomfort.

463
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Not necessarily seeking it out,

464
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,080
but certainly not trying to get rid of it when it's there.

465
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Exactly.

466
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,080
When it's circumstantial rise, which inevitably will,

467
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
then you're not cultivating that.

468
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Your attitude is mindset of resistance,

469
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,080
which means your craving is now truly diminishing.

470
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
And same.

471
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,080
You will diminish your craving when you don't cultivate your

472
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,080
attitude is mindset of welcoming, as the Buddha would say,

473
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,080
delighting and detaining the notions of current and future pleasure.

474
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,080
Like, why are you, like, when you ask yourself,

475
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
am I liable to future essential desire?

476
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Oh, yes. Why?

477
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,080
Because here and now, I'm still holding it there.

478
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,080
I'm still welcoming the prospect of it.

479
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Here and now, I haven't uprooted it.

480
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Not, I haven't dealt with it rightly once it has arisen.

481
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
No.

482
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,080
It's on the level of that possible future sensuality is only possible

483
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,080
because right here, right now, I am still valuing it.

484
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,080
I'm still haven't seen the thorough danger in it.

485
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,080
I'm still on some level delighting in it.

486
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,080
And that delight is to be dealt with here and now,

487
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:43,080
not in the future when that thing arises.
