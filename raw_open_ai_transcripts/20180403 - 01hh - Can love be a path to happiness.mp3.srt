1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Is love the path to happiness?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Is love the path to happiness?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Love in your family, love in your dogs, love in you.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So just nature, a nature of love in general?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, does that mean happiness?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Right.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The end of the day.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, the short answer is absolutely not.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is the common phenomenon of love.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's inseparable from attachment.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But if you're not attached to something, you're not loving it.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So the whole notion of the unconditional love,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
well, it's a contradiction in terms.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You're either unconditionally bound with it,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or you're emotionally divorced from it, which means you don't love it,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
which means you're not attached to it.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Because in itself, love is a bond.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Even you can make it as abstract and divine as you want.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's still a bond, because it still has its object,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
which means there is still some sort of attachment to a degree.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But actually, like, that's as people's fantasies are very often,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and they talk about their unconditional love.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Like an ideal, an abstract ideal that in practice, love is even worse.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's always, in fact, it's always mixed with infatuation,

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
with lust, with delight, with conceit, with pride,

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
with everything else.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's basically what love is.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Passion.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Passion, of course, inseparable from passion.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's where you can kill at the same time.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Full follow.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can kill forever.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, I'm sure the people will try to justify the love they would think that.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So trying to be unconditional love for everything.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, that is just an ideal, basically, that's a contradiction in terms.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because if you're, well, love, be it even unconditional, is a relationship.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Means you are, you are relating yourself to these things,

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
which means to that extent you're bound by them.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So it's impossible to have unconditional love.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If it's unconditional, means there is no condition.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There is no relationship.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But love is a relationship.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So it's basically saying, like, oh, the unconditional conditioning.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, the unconditionally conditioned, that's what unconditional love would be.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Or have a relationship with no relationship.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's just, that's a contradiction in terms.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So you can find that poetic value in saying contradictory terms.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But in itself, in practice and phenomenologically speaking,

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
makes absolutely no sense.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So you're either bound or you're free from the bond.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So it's love, virtuous.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is it a virtue?

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, it depends, but no, no.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I mean, love can be wholesome.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's one sort of slow and answering.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Love can be wholesome in a sense of, it's not necessarily, you know,

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
infatuated passion and lust and greed involved with it.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But as a bond, as something that is fundamentally still rooted

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
in a degree of passion and emotion, it is unwholesome.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
From the point of view of enlightenment, it is unwholesome.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's an obstacle, basically.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a bond that you need to break.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Love or hate, basically, if you want to be free from suffering

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
or if you want to develop your mind to the...

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, it's full potential, so to speak.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's full potential freedom, both must be abandoned equally.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Both love and hate.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So love cannot bring happiness.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It can bring world happiness, which from the ultimate point of view

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:49,000
is not happiness, obviously.
