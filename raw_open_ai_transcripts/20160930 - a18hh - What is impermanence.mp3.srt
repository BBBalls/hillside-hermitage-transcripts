1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What is your permanence?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A rising is manifest.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the soupers, it says,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
a rising is manifested,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ceasing is manifested,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
possessing or changing is manifested.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, I don't want to repeat myself,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but basically,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
impermanence pertains to that manifested bit.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, he won't be found

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in actual arising, or ceasing,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or possessing or changing, because those things

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
are all phenomena.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And impermanence pertains to the nature

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
of the phenomena.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Presisting or changing is a phenomena.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, enduring. Well, a rising

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is already possessing or changing.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You don't see the actual origin of the thing.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The point, I mean the exact split second.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, you just have a thing origin.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Which means, whether it's a rising,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or whether it's ceasing,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
it's like fading in and fading out.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And fading in, it's only the form of endurance.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's the same thing that it's increasing in its presence.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But it's the same thing.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So, it's persisting.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
As the same thing,

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
while it's changing, I increase in its presence.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And same goes for fading out.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And same goes for fading out.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For decreasing in its presence.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But the point is,

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
whether you're witnessing

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
which your senses,

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
arising of something like

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
manifestation of a thing,

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
or something just disappeared.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Both of those things arise for you

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in your experience.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, when you're looking at the actual

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
disappearance of something,

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
that is appearing for you.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, the disappearance in a particular level,

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
external level.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But as an experience,

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
it's actually arising.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's appearing for you.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's manifesting for you.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But it's that confusion that I spoke before

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
between the users of arising and the rising.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like, you should really distinguish between the rising,

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
ceasing, persisting, or changing,

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and word manifesting.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Because arising is manifested.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ceasing is manifested.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Persisting, or changing is manifested.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So, from that point of view,

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
ceasing arises.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Persisting, or changing arises.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right, appears.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So, seeing is always,

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and is always,

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
impermanence pertains to that

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
manifestation.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
To that level,

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
doesn't pertain to you having to witness a destruction

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and disappearance of a thing in order for you to know the impermanence.

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And even the Sotapana's insight says,

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
whatever has the nature of arising

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
has the nature of ceasing.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And knowing the nature means actually

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so far from seeing it being destroyed in order to realize the impermanence,

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
you actually need it to be

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
a reason in order to see it as impermanent.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So, that's why people have a problem.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
People who think the practice is like denying,

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
nothing's real, nothing exists,

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
see the science, show this is only a journey.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They basically never allow things to manifest.

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Or, are they? I mean,

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you can't really stop them from manifesting.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But they never discern the fact that things manifest

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
because they're too busy denying them.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
As a result of that,

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
well, they just completely cover up

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
any possibility of understanding

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
what the real impermanence is,

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the impermanence that matters.

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The impermanence, which, if you were to understand,

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
is pretty different suffering.

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, what about impermanence?

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So, things

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
a thing is a vision,

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
always. There's always this thing of vision,

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
like the fiber,

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I hope it's art.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There's always the thing manifested.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah. Manifested experience is

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
so that general experience.

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The only thing is that the design manifested

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
isn't bug.

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is it?

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, the unborn needs, like,

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that's something

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that the ultimate, like,

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
negative of your experience is there.

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But it doesn't manifest

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
in a sense of everything else manifests.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's like a negative.

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
For abandoning everything else,

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you develop nibbana.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But you can't just go into nibbana

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
because there will be another thing.

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The most general level

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
of experience,

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
a thing.

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, exactly. So, for as long as you have

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the fiber aggregates,

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
there's always something manifested.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's why.

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, Buddha before he became the Buddha,

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
a rising and falling,

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I mean, manifestations

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
of any kind of the five aggregates.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So, on the most general level,

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
he was contemplating the nature of a rising means

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
nature of ceasing because he has a reason.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And he became the Buddha,

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
just to that contemplation.

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, exactly. Whether you witness,

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
unless your aggregates break apart,

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
any experience that you witness,

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
that you go through,

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
that you experience,

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
even if it's a destruction of every single thing in the world,

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
even if it's a destruction of your own senses,

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
then arises for you.

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That disappearance appears for you

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
as disappearance of those things.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because things arise,

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
or rather, everything is discerned

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and arises on the level of the mind.

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's why the mind comes first.

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's why I have to understand impermanence.

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, in order to understand impermanence,

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you have to discern the

151
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
arising of things,

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
their manifestation.

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have to discern the nature of their manifestation.

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And that's it.

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If you see that they manifest,

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and you have absolutely,

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
it's inconceivable for you

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to have any say in their manifestation.

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That is just like you completely,

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
it's inaccessible.

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You cannot possibly,

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
even conceive it

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
in the utmost obstruction,

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
how it would be.

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The mind cannot go there.

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Because of that, you know,

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
for this very reason,

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that I have no say in their manifestation,

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that's why things are impermanent.

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's why things are this,

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that's why they cannot be,

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
myself.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Impossible.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So it's not that you need to figure out

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that what not self means,

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
means by seeing impermanence correctly for what it is,

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
that's automatically the experience of not self.

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's the same.

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's the same thing.

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well,

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
it's a different thing,

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
but it's basically the same experience,

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that consists of the different things.

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's within the same thing.

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because,

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
always like when people,

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
when you read the sutras,

188
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
or any contemporary Buddhist,

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
whatever,

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
interpretations,

191
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
you just assume,

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
oh, impermanence, impermanence,

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you must see a rise.

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes, and then you look for the impermanence.

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But that's why lots of people

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
really commit to it.

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The end of experience

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and I thought I was speaking from experience,

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
because,

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
no matter how much,

201
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you might even destroy things that mean to you,

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
just to show,

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
but actually that's another arising

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
of another experience.

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And it's the experience that is impermanent.

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's what Nietzsche means,

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
not the actual things.

208
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because,

209
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
as one of the wrong views

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
of the Western science,

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and I remember we studied that from chemistry.

212
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, like, nothing can get destroyed.

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's only the energy,

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and the molecules just changed the shape.

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So, I've got the names.

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't want to get them wrong,

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but it was the name of that law in the early commerce,

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
which was basically like,

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
when you burn,

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
say, you burn a piece of wood,

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
well, that energy,

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that,

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that object,

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it's formed now.

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So, now it's smoke, and I think that's transmuted.

226
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, it's basically like,

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
it's impossible to destroy the matter.

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Uh-huh.

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And see, like, from a completely wrong view,

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
they kind of arrived

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
at the outside of what I'm talking about.

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When you realize,

234
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
because basically matter,

235
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
or not matter,

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the only way you can know matter is through your experience.

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Now with the scientists, they deny

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the personal experience, they generally project it outside as,

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
it's a matter.

240
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's a genuine matter that they are accessing and dealing with,

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
not their experience, or it.

242
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So then they say, oh, it's a genuine matter that you cannot destroy.

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But basically what they're saying is,

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
even the destruction is another experience for you,

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so you can't destroy your experience.

246
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Mm-hmm.

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And Buddha goes even further, saying, even death

248
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
would not be a destruction of your experience,

249
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
because you continue.

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So, only Aravan truly destroys the experience,

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
how, by abandoning it,

252
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
but seeing that he could have not,

253
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that he could have not have owned it.

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He could have not had owned it.

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, one or the other.

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He could have, I think, he could have not owned it.

257
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think that's the best thing.

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No matter what.

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And fully understanding that,

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
he just, like, he automatically let's go.

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No, no, no, you're not.

262
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Automatically, it's abandoned.

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So that's what I mean.

264
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You discern, oh, it's arising.

265
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, no, sorry.

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Through manifestation,

267
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
or through something that is present,

268
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
you can all, it's arising.

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's increasing that very manifestation,

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that's already manifested.

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Or it's decreasing that very manifestation,

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
it's all remembered.

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's just both, oh,

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
the manifestation isn't using still

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
of the same thing.

276
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But you don't, like, concern yourself

277
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
with moments of it's arising,

278
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
moments of his cessation,

279
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
because it's a completely wrong view,

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and you can't even see those things.

281
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because all you're seeing is your own experience

282
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
of those things.

283
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And that experience is manifested.

284
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So then you're assuming yourself

285
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
as, like,

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
external to it,

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and then observing of its linear progression,

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
linear kind of endurance in time,

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
whereby it fingerizes, oh, it's still there,

290
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and now it's gone.

291
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But see, you left yourself completely out.

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If you wanted to.

293
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's irrelevant.

294
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And you also fail to see that even now,

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the experience of now this thing is gone,

296
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that is present for you.

297
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But your mind is out concerned

298
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
with that external object of your senses,

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and you generally believe

300
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
that now it's gone.

301
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But actually, it's not gone.

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
For as long as you'd be thinking about it,

303
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and exist in you, like, well,

304
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
even for as long as your five aggregates exist

305
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
with this intact memory in the mind,

306
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that thing has its form,

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
it has a form of its presence.

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Even if you can't find its material counterpart anymore,

309
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
or other material aspects,

310
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
it's not exactly counterpart.

311
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Which is how you can still think about people

312
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
that are dying,

313
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
or they're gone, things that have been destroyed,

314
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
they haven't.

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's the thing.

316
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
As a phenomenon, those things are still

317
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
manifesting in your experience.

318
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The projection of the matter and stuff,

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
whatever else wrong views people might have,

320
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
where you think the world exists

321
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
independent of you, or you exist independent of the world,

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
or both of neither,

323
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
or you're confused in regard to it,

324
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
then, yeah, you will believe that

325
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
this material aspect is the thing,

326
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but then, see,

327
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
then you can't account for your thinking of it

328
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
when that matter disappears.

329
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But the thing was never in the matter,

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
nor was never in your mind,

331
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
in your consciousness.

332
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So now it's that very absence of that matter,

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
there stands for the matter

334
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
of that thing when you think about it,

335
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
a negative matter.

336
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ah, this, my favourite thing,

337
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
is gone.

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It used to be right here.

339
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So now the empty space

340
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
becomes the material aspect

341
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
of the matter you're thinking about,

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
because it was always name and matter.

343
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But the views that people have,

344
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
projects give the priority

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
to the matter,

346
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
which is why you keep looking for the destruction

347
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
of the matter to find the proof

348
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
for impermanence.

349
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But there's no external proof for impermanence,

350
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
because that's another thing that arises,

351
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and the another thing that you can take to be permanent.

352
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So the proof

353
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
for impermanence

354
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
is in a rising of thing,

355
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
or rather, yeah,

356
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the proof for things

357
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
in permanence in its nature

358
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
would be in the nature of that

359
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
manifestation.

360
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So things are impermanent,

361
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
now because you can observe the destruction,

362
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
things are impermanent

363
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
because they have a reason

364
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
in the first place.

365
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's why they will have to cease.

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, beyond your control.

367
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Like inconceivable.

368
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because you can still concede a formal control.

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You say, oh, this is beyond my control.

370
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But you can see a sense of control

371
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
in regard to that.

372
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you really drilled this deep enough,

373
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
it becomes inconceivable

374
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
even in that remote sense.

375
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because all you're going to find is

376
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
these things manifested.

377
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And then through that manifestation,

378
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you can discern how it's arising,

379
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
how it's persisting,

380
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
how it's changing.

381
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's manifesting.

382
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's the bottom line.

383
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And it's right there where you can see

384
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
because it's manifested.

385
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And even the word manifest,

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to do with you, just it's there.

387
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
For that very reason,

388
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
you won't be there.

389
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Not because you can destroy it,

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
not because others,

391
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
simply because it came

392
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
uninvited.

393
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's the whole existence here.

394
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's the nature of the five aggregates.

395
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
To arise and fall.

396
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
To be manifested.

397
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
To be manifested.

398
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Until they break apart.

399
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And that's why in regard to the five aggregates,

400
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
you establish that assumption.

401
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That they are used,

402
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
that you are theirs,

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
or whatever they're using control.

404
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Basically, that's how opadana gets involved with,

405
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
in regard to the five aggregates.

406
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But you can't really

407
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
if the five aggregates are not opadana,

408
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
but there's no opadana without the five aggregates.

409
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's chew a little bit.

410
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I think.

411
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They are indifferent to you,

412
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the five aggregates.

413
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They go their own course.

414
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But it's interference due to the like,

415
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
ignorance.

416
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Not knowing that you cannot interfere.

417
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That lack of knowledge is the form of interference.

418
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And that interference,

419
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
in regard to them, can't really change a five aggregates

420
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
or do anything with them.

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But it can certainly feel the assumption that you are,

422
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that you are in control, that they're used,

423
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
that they belong to you, that whatever else.

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But all they do is manifest.

425
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And because they manifest, they cease.

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So, in terms of...

427
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I know we can go there to suit the 35, isn't it?

428
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Which one?

429
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Imagine me coming in.

430
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Which one?

431
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think the 35.

432
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The one with...

433
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Do you see this?

434
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
39.

435
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What's this?

436
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I started with the...

437
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I know.

438
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
First I'm assuming,

439
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
consciousness gets reborn.

440
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And consciousness passes on from life to life to life.

441
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And he says, that's what the Buddha taught.

442
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, this is about the venerable astrology.

443
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's a 35.

444
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, but 39.

445
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I think...

446
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But it's right after something.

447
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I do remember that.

448
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
38.

449
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's like, do you see?

450
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Because this has got to be.

451
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

452
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's 38.

453
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's...

454
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's...

455
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's a big sati.

456
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is it some of the...

457
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Is it some of the fishmen?

458
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's some of the fishmen.

459
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So, what about it?

460
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, it is...

461
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What started with...

462
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He has the view that consciousness gets reborn.

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah.

464
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He thinks it's the same consciousness that runs him on this

465
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
through the rounds of rebirths,

466
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
but it's not another.

467
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's the...

468
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
inexperience.

469
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Things just are.

470
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And so, to assume that you've...

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
To explain...

472
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Well, the only way you can think is to assume it.

473
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Because it's inconceivable.

474
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes.

475
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's inconceivable to...

476
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Like, you can't even conceive...

477
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like, the rebirth.

478
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
In a sense of something would be...

479
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Like, ignorant manifestations.

480
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Like, things are manifesting to...

481
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Your five vibrigates.

482
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Try your life and experience.

483
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And you have ignorance in regard to that.

484
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And you base these external assumptions.

485
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And then you think, oh, I must be this.

486
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's passing to the next life.

487
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But everything, even this.

488
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Even the idea of this.

489
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And the idea of the next life.

490
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And the idea of passing.

491
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
All of that is already fully affected.

492
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Like, fundamentals of your own experience.

493
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
From the very start.

494
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But he's...

495
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He's used...

496
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This passing point between this life and the next life.

497
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It doesn't exist.

498
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But there's still the passing from this consciousness to that.

499
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Which is a thing in itself.

500
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's a thing in itself.

501
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The limbo is another realm.

502
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So to speak.

503
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If you pass from this life into limbo.

504
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, that's another thing.

505
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Between lives.

506
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Well, that's not life.

507
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So there's always...

508
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So the manifestation of the aggregates continues.

509
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And you can discern it.

510
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's what the Buddha said.

511
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No matter how many lifetimes somebody can remember.

512
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Whether it's one, five, five hundred, five thousand.

513
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
All they're going to remember is a rising and passing.

514
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The manifestation of the five aggregates of one particular among them.

515
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
They won't...

516
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
They can't imagine...

517
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No, because there's a link between...

518
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's another thing, yeah.

519
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
In between exists only between the two things.

520
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And that in between is the third thing.

521
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
As in between.

522
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
As a negative of the both things, it's a thing.

523
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's a meant that even the absence of a material aspect

524
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
of a certain thing that you're thinking of,

525
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
that absence is a thing.

526
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's why space is often listed

527
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
as one of the... one of the great elements.

528
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
With consciousness.

529
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So you have four great elements of what if I...

530
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Space and consciousness.

531
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because if you look at it,

532
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
there's a very little distinction between them.

533
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because even space, the negative,

534
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
the absence of matter,

535
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
serves as matter.

536
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And the consciousness is listed within because the consciousness is actually

537
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
in that sense external,

538
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
with that matter.

539
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So you can't conceive...

540
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, you can conceive, sorry, you can conceive matter,

541
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
which is more of a reality.

542
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But truly, you can't access the matter.

543
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But in the same sense,

544
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
you can't access your own consciousness.

545
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Because it's all your own consciousness.

546
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's out there with those four great elements.

547
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
How outside of your reach?

548
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So what are you going to have?

549
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's basically Nama Rupa.

550
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's all that appears.

551
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No matter how remote, how big use,

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
how distant, how abstract,

553
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
it's still within the Nama Rupa.

554
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You can't have the experience of consciousness in itself,

555
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
or matter in itself,

556
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
or even have its conscious matter,

557
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
i.e., the real experience of Nama Rupa.

558
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But both ends of that experience,

559
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
i.e. consciousness and the matter

560
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
are external to you,

561
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
in principle, inaccessible.

562
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Which makes Nama Rupa inaccessible to you.

563
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You can just be witnessing it.

564
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, suffering or account of it,

565
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
or whatever else.

566
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But you can't access it either.

567
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
In its nature,

568
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
manifests,

569
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and for those reasons,

570
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
it ceases.

571
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Just because it manifests.

572
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Just because it comes from the direction

573
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that it's inaccessible to you.

574
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So, it would be like

575
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
you're wearing borrowed clothes,

576
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
that's your idea where it came from,

577
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and your idea when it's going to be taken away from you.

578
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's your life.

579
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's everyone's life.

580
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Entirely.

581
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Because it's the thing,

582
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
oh, well, like, you know,

583
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I can still enjoy borrowed stuff.

584
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You could, if you were to know,

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
when the person is going to come and take it away.

586
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, I still have two months to go.

587
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But you don't.

588
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It can be, after the next in breath.

589
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And that's it.

590
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And you realize, oh, okay,

591
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I better adjust my plans accordingly.

592
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But no people adjust their plans accordingly,

593
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
or what if you do.

594
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So, when things are taken away from you,

595
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
they're always in the, like,

596
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
in the stress.

597
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But if you were, there's nothing based on

598
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
if you don't plan,

599
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
like to simplify it a bit.

600
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If you don't plan anything on a kind of borrowed things,

601
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and those things are taken away,

602
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you will remain completely unaffected.

603
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So, basically, when death comes,

604
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
you will be completely unaffected

605
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
if you don't plan anything on a kind of life.

606
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Because life is a thing,

607
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
that's borrowed.

608
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, that's kind of in front of you,

609
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and then you decided to borrow it.

610
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But you have no idea who owns it

611
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and who takes it away at what time.

612
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And the Buddha did say something similar.

613
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He said,

614
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Mara can do with people what he wants

615
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
because they come to his territory

616
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and use his things.

617
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So, it's like a bait.

618
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
On the kind of that, he's in charge of them.

619
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And then what are those things?

620
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And you might think,

621
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
oh, I'm awesome behavior.

622
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There is those things or something.

623
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's much more than that.

624
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Those things are your eyes,

625
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
your ears, your nose, your tongue,

626
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
your whole sense base.

627
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And it's kind of like that's all Mara.

628
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So, you realize,

629
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
okay, so whatever appears in some line.

630
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, funny enough, we're going to say,

631
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
whatever appears,

632
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and everything that you know of,

633
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
everything that you think of,

634
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
everything that you might see or hear

635
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and think of,

636
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
it will have that in common

637
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
that it will appear.

638
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And for that reason, it will not be yours

639
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
or other it cannot be yours.

640
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, you might take it, sir.

641
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Who says,

642
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
everything becomes like a piece of wood.

643
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yes, it does.

644
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, yeah, when he has the monks in the forest.

645
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah.

646
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Would you, like, well,

647
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
some of you would probably be,

648
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
how do you say?

649
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Well, it was basically talking about the,

650
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
you know, people being upset

651
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
on a kind of sickness or death,

652
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
something happening to your body.

653
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And he said, he asked monks, would you be upset

654
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
if somebody comes in this woods now?

655
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And starts collecting these dried up twigs

656
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and branches that fell off the trees.

657
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I'm like, no, we wouldn't, of course.

658
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
There's nothing to do with us.

659
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's how you should regard yourself

660
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
because it has nothing to do with you.

661
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But that also requires giving up the pleasures

662
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that you gain through that body.

663
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Which is why it's so intoxicating.

664
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And again, there's another suit, I was about to say it,

665
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
but there is another suit that says it better.

666
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
If this human will only be consisting of pain,

667
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
people wouldn't need much of prompting

668
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
to go for liberation.

669
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But it doesn't.

670
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It consists of that pleasure as well.

671
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Which is why people get intoxicated

672
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and blinded in regard to that,

673
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
which is hurting them.

674
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You just don't see it.

675
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Because you're intoxicated with little pleasure

676
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
you get from it.

677
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But both.

678
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Or within the nature of the borrowed goods.

679
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Did you know permission to borrow?

680
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And you certainly know control how long you can use it.

681
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So basically, it's even worse.

682
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And then you think you own it.

683
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So imagine your surprise.

684
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And Mara does come and collect what he is.

685
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Well, it always was he is.

686
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That's why they're not like all the other suitors

687
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
who often talk about their puppet on the strings.

688
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So all the things you borrow are basically the strings

689
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
that Mara uses then to pull you.

690
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Because you hold onto those strings.

691
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So the puppet is going with the strings

692
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that are yanking it.

693
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But also even that self.

694
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Even that person that holds onto things,

695
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
experience, or that self that is manifest.

696
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That must also be seen.

697
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Same.

698
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You just see everything with the same right view.

699
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So even that sense of self.

700
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's a reason.

701
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's manifest.

702
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You can designate.

703
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's real.

704
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So the Buddha never said there is no self.

705
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He said, well, basically, there is not self.

706
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So that which you take to be a self,

707
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that sense of self, doesn't belong to you.

708
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Is that a stop being able to see your own view?

709
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Both the right view.

710
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah.

711
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You have it.

712
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You have that wrong view.

713
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And that sense of self is actually, well,

714
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
as the Buddha said,

715
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
it can often be just a sense of an individual sense

716
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
of a particularly unique set of five aggregates.

717
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That you take to be like the most personal aspect

718
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
of your experience,

719
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
so you take to be the yourself.

720
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But no matter what sense of self it is,

721
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
how strong it is,

722
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
leave it for what it is.

723
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't try to deny it when you get it,

724
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
because there will be again,

725
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
denying the things that you can't even deny.

726
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
They manifest on their own.

727
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So you're trying to cover up the contradiction in terms

728
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
that's where people end up being very frustrated.

729
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But the point is, no,

730
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
allow your sense of self,

731
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
actually see your sense of self as a phenomenon.

732
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Like, basically,

733
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
these other words saying,

734
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
see your sense of self as manifested,

735
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
because it is manifested.

736
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
In very ambiguous terms,

737
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
but it's still manifested as such.

738
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So see it like that,

739
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and then don't regard it as belonging to you.

740
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah, because even your self,

741
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
it's just, yeah.

742
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, nothing,

743
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
nothing in an experience you could have created.

744
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Which means everything you can abandon everything.

745
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
All of it can be abandoned.

746
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's just the idea that something,

747
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
that something can create things

748
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
without being a thing itself.

749
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And then you feel like,

750
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
all you need to undo certain processes or whatever,

751
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
in order for it to stop,

752
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and then you can really

753
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
abandon self as, no,

754
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
that's already the act of yourself.

755
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You just have to see,

756
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and that's why at any time,

757
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
you can see the right view.

758
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
No matter what situation,

759
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
go to bed.

760
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
If you look through the whole thing,

761
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
including your sense of self,

762
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and not only.

763
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Like, I recognize that you can't only

764
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
in your sense of self,

765
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
which is why it's not yours.

766
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So there is not self.

767
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There is that which you take to be self,

768
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
but it's not yourself.

769
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Resultate,

770
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
this sort of debt,

771
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
so you just abandon it.

772
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
When it continues about,

773
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
do you see this?

774
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Well, yeah,

775
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
it comes like to the very fundamental age.

776
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Do you see this has manifested?

777
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yes, when there was a,

778
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
do you see it manifested

779
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
with this as a condition?

780
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes, when there was a,

781
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
do you see it with the disappearance

782
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
of that condition?

783
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What has come,

784
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
what is manifested has come to cessation?

785
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Like this deep domain standing.

786
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So you need to introduce that,

787
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
like, a determination.

788
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I do see this as a condition

789
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
of the manifested thing.

790
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
While you're seeing the manifested thing,

791
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
so it's not an explanation

792
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
of a linear causality.

793
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh, this A creates B,

794
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
and I'm watching both,

795
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
thus I'm not myself.

796
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Like, that's just complete magical thinking.

797
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Will you project?

798
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Well, all of the things are impermanent.

799
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
They constantly change in the scientists,

800
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
say the atoms, the atoms are molecules.

801
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
They're never,

802
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
in one electrons,

803
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
they're never in the same spot,

804
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
etc.

805
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So,

806
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I still suffer

807
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
when I kind of

808
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
fulfill these eyes,

809
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and I kind of being paper people

810
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and I'll be prepared,

811
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
being separate from people

812
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and I'll be separated from.

813
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No matter what scientific view

814
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I might talk,

815
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
it doesn't pertain to you.

816
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But,

817
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
if you see as all those things

818
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
as manifested,

819
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
when I say manifested

820
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
by themselves on their own,

821
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
it means determined by something

822
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
other than you.

823
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yet,

824
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
like the entire manifestation

825
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
is completely out of your hands.

826
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And if that's

827
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
the direction where they came from,

828
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
that determination,

829
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
disappears,

830
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
they can't possibly stay,

831
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
which means

832
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
you're gone,

833
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
your experience is taken away.

834
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So, it says,

835
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
do you see it as determined by

836
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
something else?

837
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, in this particular suit,

838
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
that he uses the

839
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
element.

840
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Do you see it as

841
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
neutralment?

842
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah.

843
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And it's neutral

844
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
into something that you don't

845
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
necessarily see particularly.

846
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
No, because there wouldn't be a

847
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
neutralment,

848
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
it would be another thing.

849
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's now

850
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
neutral, but something else.

851
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So,

852
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
that's why I say,

853
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
while you're aware

854
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
of the manifesto thing,

855
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
within that manifesto thing,

856
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
you can discern

857
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
its neutralment.

858
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But not by

859
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
looking away

860
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
from the manifesto thing,

861
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and then,

862
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
why?

863
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Because then you will be

864
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
looking at another

865
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
manifested thing,

866
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
which you will think is

867
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the neutralment

868
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
of the previous manifesto thing.

869
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So, see how you

870
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
kind of squeezed yourself out,

871
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and made this whole

872
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
relationship external.

873
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
If it's external,

874
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it won't be the right view.

875
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Needs to arise internally.

876
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So, needs to arise

877
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
within the manifested thing,

878
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the neutralment

879
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
would be then

880
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
the real neutralment

881
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
because you have an

882
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
abandoned manifesto thing.

883
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
To me,

884
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
it's all about this.

885
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, it's not

886
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
A

887
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and B.

888
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's

889
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
A

890
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and smaller A.

891
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Within

892
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that A.

893
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So,

894
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
the general experience,

895
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
in particular,

896
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
things inside it?

897
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Sure.

898
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But that's a very

899
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
general thing to put,

900
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
to put it in a way,

901
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
it's just like,

902
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
two general.

903
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Well, no,

904
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
when you say,

905
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
it's just general,

906
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
in particular,

907
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
it's an explanation.

908
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
No.

909
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's an experience.

910
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Well, again,

911
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
general thing can become

912
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
particular if you

913
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
forget about it as

914
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
general,

915
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and then you

916
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
rather experience it

917
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
more generally than you

918
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
got to it.

919
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And you still think

920
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
you think of general

921
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
thing.

922
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Means,

923
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
whatever is manifested,

924
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
any of the

925
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
aggregates,

926
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
whatever is manifested.

927
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Or you can just go

928
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
as we spoke before,

929
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the presence of your body,

930
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
the presence of your mind,

931
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
two simultaneous things,

932
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
inseparable from it.

933
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But you can see,

934
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
when you think about a

935
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
body, well,

936
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
that's a mental

937
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
image.

938
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You don't worry about it.

939
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So everything

940
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
shares the nature

941
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
of a mental

942
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
image.

943
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And what does it mean?

944
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Everything is

945
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
manifested.

946
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Because everything

947
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
manifests on the

948
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
level of a mental

949
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
image.

950
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So, why do you

951
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
have the mental

952
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
image of that certain

953
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
thing?

954
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You discern its

955
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
new treatment within

956
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
that.

957
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And discerning its

958
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
new treatment means

959
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
discerning it as

960
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
coming from something

961
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
other than

962
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
the presence of

963
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
self.

964
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That's what you

965
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
said.

966
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Like, you need to see a

967
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
thing depending upon

968
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
something else that

969
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
cannot be yours.

970
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And then that

971
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
thing that is yours will

972
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
be disowned.

973
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Because you just

974
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
actually, I can't

975
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
own this.

976
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Because if that thing

977
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
that I cannot own

978
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
disappears, this thing

979
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
will not stand.

980
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So actually,

981
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that thing belongs

982
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
to the other.

983
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It belongs to

984
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
its new treatment.

985
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It cannot

986
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
belong to me.

987
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Because I

988
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
have no say in its

989
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
appearance.

990
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I have no say in its

991
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
appearance.

992
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So this, yeah.

993
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
This has appeared

994
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
because of that

995
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
because of which

996
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
has appeared.

997
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Because

998
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
like, this

999
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
experience, this

1000
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
mental experience, this

1001
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
experience, this

1002
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
experience of

1003
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:43,000
normal

1004
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
root.

1005
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Its

1006
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
new treatment is

1007
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
well, we can

1008
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
speak about it.

1009
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We can say the

1010
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
experience of

1011
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
self.

1012
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That I said

1013
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
self is a

1014
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
manifested phenomenon.

1015
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That you

1016
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
confused to, well, that

1017
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
you conceived to belong

1018
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
to you.

1019
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But it's on the

1020
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
earth.

1021
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So you can take your

1022
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
sense of self.

1023
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Then a bigger sense of

1024
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
self.

1025
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And it's manifested.

1026
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So you need to discern

1027
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
its manifestation

1028
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
whether it through

1029
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
increasing its presence,

1030
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
decreasing its presence,

1031
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
or simply

1032
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
persisting either way.

1033
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So when you

1034
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
become skilled in

1035
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
like discerning

1036
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
manifestation, picking

1037
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
up the signs of

1038
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
things.

1039
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That's the picking of

1040
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
the signs of your

1041
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
mind.

1042
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Chitanivita.

1043
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Within that, then,

1044
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
when you think about,

1045
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
okay, what is this

1046
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
thing inseparable

1047
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
from?

1048
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What is a necessary

1049
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
condition?

1050
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What is a new

1051
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
treatment?

1052
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What is a basis for

1053
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
these sense of self to

1054
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
be here?

1055
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
But then you have to,

1056
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
like, you only

1057
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
summon a secret

1058
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
root.

1059
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The womb

1060
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
attention means exactly

1061
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
that.

1062
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Goes to the root of the

1063
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
present thing.

1064
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Not to the root of

1065
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
another thing.

1066
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Of another experience.

1067
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So that's why you need

1068
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
that proper attention to

1069
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
discern within the

1070
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
present manifestation to

1071
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
discern its

1072
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
conditions.

1073
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Or formations.

1074
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Or determinations.

1075
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Or

1076
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
sancaro, whatever you

1077
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
want to translate it.

1078
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So with our

1079
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
abandoning, the

1080
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
manifest sense of

1081
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
self that you're

1082
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
mindful of.

1083
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You need to discern

1084
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
within that

1085
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
what is that sense of

1086
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
self inseparable

1087
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
from?

1088
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And then whatever you

1089
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
find would

1090
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
will most likely be a

1091
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
determination that, I

1092
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
think, unless you

1093
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
over-intended, or rather

1094
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
over-attended, that

1095
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
manifestation in looking

1096
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
for its

1097
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
new treatment and then

1098
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
found other things that

1099
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
then became

1100
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
manifestations.

1101
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And they themselves

1102
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
had their own

1103
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
new treatments within

1104
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
themselves that you

1105
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
have not seen.

1106
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because you have to

1107
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
consider that

1108
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
you have to consider

1109
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
that you have to

1110
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
consider that

1111
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
you have to consider

1112
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
that you have to

1113
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
consider that

1114
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
you have to consider

1115
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
that you have to

1116
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,000
consider that

1117
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
you have to consider

1118
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that you have to consider

1119
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that you have to consider

1120
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
that you have to consider

1121
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
that you have to consider

1122
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
that you are

1123
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,800
mindful of

1124
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,000
its insignificant

1125
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yes.

1126
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,680
The

1127
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:07,080
my statement

1128
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,360
of this

1129
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,800
I was very

1130
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,440
sensing

1131
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,140
You know counting deep with the probe and then pulling this thing out everything else is the same

1132
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,720
Just that one big there one misunderstanding of the very good

1133
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,280
colors and sort of poses everything else

1134
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
Curious so back on the sense of self

1135
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,040
What is it? What is it inseparable from while that sense of self is present within that sense of self discern

1136
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
What is inseparable from

1137
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,200
Could you have sense of self present without being able to think

1138
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,720
Without having any mental images whatsoever would you be able to descend at the biggest sense of self and me?

1139
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:05,360
You wouldn't so would you be able to think if there is no living body that it's still operating and paid with conscious and so they are in the world

1140
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,440
You wouldn't

1141
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,440
So then is that living body paid because you wouldn't be able to think you wouldn't be able to have sense of self

1142
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,240
So then there wouldn't be a sense of self in that sense that would belong to you because if something would happen to that body

1143
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,560
If something would happen to that consciousness if something to happen to that ability to think

1144
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,880
That sense of self goes cannot possibly remain standing

1145
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,160
You see me while it's in there see you can see all that like on a board

1146
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,440
You can write it down as a chart and it will make good sense explanation

1147
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,680
But it will not be open I go and you certainly not

1148
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,520
Feel from suffering or bring you closer to it. Why because you're not seeing it in the right order and by the right order

1149
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,760
I mean you don't you're seeing it literally you don't see

1150
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
One within the other

1151
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Not next to a while

1152
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,400
One while the other is still present

1153
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,720
So you're seeing it left and right or down

1154
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,680
But you're not seeing it within that thing

1155
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
You take the self

1156
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:17,640
That's where the whole the whole I'll be done in the commentaries. That's where the entire attitude the entire way of looking is completely wrong

1157
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,160
You all the stuff from the suitors are there rich and linear like packed in lists and stuff

1158
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,520
But it's all in there. It's all out there that you can observe

1159
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,960
That's why there's always a reason the order of things the Buddha would he wouldn't just list things out to you

1160
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,440
You'll be like well like this. Do you see this has come to be yes now that you see that this has come to be

1161
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,760
That sense of self I'm talking about right now that it's manifested that you see it for what it is

1162
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,680
Yeah, do you see it inseparable from certain nutrients?

1163
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,400
Like he would not be able to he would not be able to even be conceived without those nutrients present

1164
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Yes, Lord, we see that

1165
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,320
So would you see that with the cessation of those nutrients?

1166
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,840
This will not remain standing even for a split second inconceivable like the two sticks holding each other

1167
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
You move on the other one goes down

1168
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:18,440
Yes, Lord, we see and then he refers to that because this this view is the purified and bright view as it is

1169
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,280
Basically, that's the right that just just that principle is the right view

1170
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,480
Nothing else and that's why they're like the kind of generic

1171
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,160
Thermal like so sort of party for the right views like, oh, whatever has the nature of rising has the nature of ceasing

1172
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,040
Whatever it's manifested will have to see basically because it's manifested

1173
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,200
And then he said even that view as pure as bright like

1174
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,040
Your band don't even that

1175
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:53,520
By using that view you abandon all the wrong views, and then you just let go even of that view and then the dharma is truly told as

1176
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Like as a simile of the raft and so

1177
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
Yeah, so it's a

1178
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,120
Take a sense of self again. Why is this manifest good is

1179
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:19,800
Some of like you keep that in front yeah, but then you look at the whole the two sides at the same time

1180
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,000
But they start distinguishing the sides as within that front you're keeping

1181
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,120
Yeah, I can't explain. I know because it's not spatial. Yeah, it doesn't pretend to space

1182
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,040
But I know what you mean. I'm just saying to the same

1183
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,920
That's why it's so easy to confuse what comes first what comes second

1184
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
It's

1185
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,600
kind of the same on the same level, but there is first there is second depending on what you attend

1186
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,520
So as I said you can over attend and then start attending those

1187
00:40:52,520 --> 00:41:01,280
Supposed in utriments of your sense of self as as separate senses of self as separate things that you just do to be yours

1188
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,040
But no, you want to have that thing in front of you

1189
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,160
Sense of self

1190
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,240
Within this very present sense of self you discern things

1191
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:21,480
Without abandoning so while you're mindful of the sense of self within that mindfulness of the sense of self

1192
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,360
You discern things that this sense of self isn't separable from as sense of self

1193
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
And

1194
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,640
Like see that there will be all over doing it. You can call it later

1195
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,400
That's why like in your set up. Well, like somebody might not necessarily use the 12 factored

1196
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,240
Explanation, but it's about because all they see is with this this is and that's it

1197
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,040
That's what I'm talking about with this this is so with these nutrients this is, but you see it in reverse order

1198
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,160
Then later you can start discerning more and more where you become proficient in that

1199
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,240
Principle as when they were under the ins and off. This is so easy. You've seen all the time. You said no

1200
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,280
Don't say that because like before for the very reason people don't see that which you find easy now

1201
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,400
They remain bound for some sort of for like

1202
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,680
Well, in total amounts of times

1203
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,480
Yeah, I can legal it my sense of self now

1204
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,560
What is it with the sense of self?

1205
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
What is this?

1206
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:42,880
You can simplify it, but as long as you do it right according to well as long as you do the principle right you can

1207
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,720
As simplified as you want in terms of designation you can just say with this this

1208
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,080
But in your mind see thing within I think

1209
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,200
Nothing next to the thing nothing before the thing nothing after the thing

1210
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,360
Think within the present thing and that's why it's a callica. It's time less

1211
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:09,520
Does not pertain to time because it's one within the other simultaneously present

1212
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:20,200
That's why I'm learning the pastor I remember using saying like when it feels like a thought a thought closes upon itself

1213
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,840
Because you don't go left. You don't go right. You don't go to another thought. You have a thought present

1214
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
Whatever shape of form and within that

1215
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,280
You sort of well, let it go in a sense

1216
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:38,080
Seat impossible to own like you you have no it like we notice you have no idea where it came from

1217
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,280
Which is the direction of its origin is just in Brazil. So you just have a thing arisen and

1218
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,360
For that very reason you recognize a thing will cease

1219
00:43:46,360 --> 00:44:01,360
Does a swing is in public?
