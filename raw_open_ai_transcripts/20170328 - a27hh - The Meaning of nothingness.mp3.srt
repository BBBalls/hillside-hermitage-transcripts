1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,880
To me, there's always this gap between self and others, other things, it can never

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,040
be filled, but you can never get to anything, that self can never hurt anything. There's always this

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:40,640
abyss that can never be crossed, if you know what I mean. Yeah, oh no, thisness, yeah, never

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:54,160
able to get anything, no matter how intense you want it. Well, that gap is the result of you assuming

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,360
the sense of self, which obviously automatically means assuming the self of others, or rather

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,240
assuming self internally, assuming self externally. So for as long as that assumption is given the

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,800
priority, as long as it's the center of your acts and thinking, they will be a gap generated as a result of it.

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,080
You see, and then that's how things are, so it's a mistake, so to speak, but it's a

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,520
beginning-less mistake. So then the gap is real, and the sense of self is real, and the sense of

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,080
others is also real. So you just have to reverse it. Instead of me trying to fill this gap, trying to

11
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:40,160
possess this gap, trying to acquire things and others or whatever else, you realize that the whole

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,480
picture is upside down, so it's actually you are the result. You're sent to self-sense about this

13
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:57,920
if the result or the gap that's impossible to own. So it's not me reaching out to possess the gap,

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:07,120
to fill the gap. It's basically gap defining me as well as that being that's in lack, that's

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,360
lacking, that's in the need, and so on. So when you recognize that actually you are secondary,

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
your sense of self is secondary to the gap, and you start seeing gap as a phenomenon, then you

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,440
will start reaching for it less and less, because you recognize actually reaching is the result of

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,040
the gap, not that reaching is the beginning when you kind of try to get the gap and fill it.

19
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,360
Because you feel the need to fill because the gap is there. So if you appropriate the gap,

20
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,040
you appropriate the need to fill. For if you appropriate the possibility of that gap being filled

21
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,920
through your assumption, you will then crave to fill the gap. But none of that will possible if

22
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,160
the gap hasn't risen there beforehand on its own, manifest it, a reason to you. So if you recognize

23
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,080
that this need to fill it, it's because it has a reason as such. It's not yours, it's not you

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,600
filling it, or trying you trying to fill, or that it needs to be there. The gap arises as a gap.

25
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,920
So then the need to fill doesn't belong to anybody, and then you stop filling it.

26
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:18,320
This is the need for oneness, or the idea that oneness. That's only the result of the separation.

27
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,480
Unity applies separation, and as much as separation applies the possibility of unity,

28
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,400
but abandoning both means none of it is applicable anymore.

29
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,840
Because people would think that unity, but that's only because they maintain

30
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:49,600
the idea of separation through craving for unity. You have to abandoning both. You have to see

31
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,600
that whether it's separating or united, or both separate united, neither separate nor united,

32
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,200
it's rather earned, and it's determined by the presence of the gap beforehand,

33
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,720
presence of the senses beforehand. So you can't stop that. You can't stop that when I say

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,760
before, and I mean structurally before, not temporarily, before, temporarily before.

35
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,040
So things arise on the wrong, the manifest, including your thoughts, and then always you

36
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,040
appropriate them, you assume that the ownership in hindsight, in retrospect, you say,

37
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,640
well, that was mine, but the fact that things arise on the wrong means you're not their creator,

38
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,760
their eyes to you, you might feel that they are rising for you, and so on, but all of

39
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:45,120
the very secondary to their arising. So if it seemed like that, then the whole idea of

40
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,920
unity, separation, feeling again, craving for it, impossible to insatiable, you can't satisfy

41
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,600
desires or whatever else, all that is the result of the things that have ordered your reason,

42
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,120
and you appropriate them. So appropriate them means you fall under, will you become a victim?

43
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,680
So speak of their inherent pressure, like the pressure of the senses, senses are like one that

44
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,160
in most they want to go in feed, where they want to go in feed. You take them to videos, I mean,

45
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,320
you are going there to feed, they are dragging you left and right, like crocodile, monkey,

46
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,080
wild boar, all those similarities are for the senses. But they do that on their own, that's their

47
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,600
business. It's just you interfering with, you are trying to own it, which means because they're

48
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,600
stronger than you, they'll take you with them, if you're stronger than them, then you'll be in

49
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,160
control of the senses, but the only way to be stronger than your senses is to let go them,

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,760
to recognize what they are. Obviously that is possible to do only once you have restrained them,

51
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:05,840
that's why sealer comes first. And then the whole idea of of of of of of feeling that gap,

52
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,560
which is becoming inconceivable, because that gap was only the result of maintaining that mistake

53
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,640
upon usher, that then in return would be feeding more of the desire for ownership, because it's

54
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:25,360
obviously that you can't own, but you took the whole, like you took it, the entire situation is taken

55
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,400
in an upside down manner, and that's and that is taken for granted. So no matter how much you

56
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,040
kind of your experience shows you that you can't fill that gap, that you can't own things,

57
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,440
you never really question that assumption, you just keep doing it, you just keep it each time,

58
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,760
and you can't help it, and you even say here my desire can never be satisfied, but you can't help

59
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,480
going after them, because the five, five senses are pulling me, and it's weak, but if you were to

60
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,280
start using hold on, what if I've taken this completely the wrong way around, what if it's not

61
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,640
supposed to be filled, and what if that whole idea of feeling this gap and this desire is the

62
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,280
result of me trying to fill the gap and the desires. So you constantly trying will make you want to try,

63
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,240
see it's a vicious circle, it just goes around, but the entire thing is entirely gratuitous,

64
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,880
it's just there's nothing, because there could be a desire, if you look at marriage and relationships

65
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,120
like that, the desire to be united with the other person, the love, so this constant craving,

66
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,040
yeah, it's not a problem, the purest of the of the worldly, what anyone will love for that matter

67
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,080
actually, it's just absolutely rooted in attachment, rooted in craving, rooted in that

68
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,240
assumption of ownership, so yeah there is pure love and a pure love is pretty much craving,

69
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,840
because once that's in play, that love that is designed to, for oneness, there is something

70
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,520
constantly, yeah, and for as long as you take that assumption for granted, means you will keep

71
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,040
trying, means you will never take all of the signs of your experience, they're showing you that

72
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,840
you can't actually fill that gap, no, can you satisfy your desires, you will never take that

73
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,800
as a sign, as an indication that actually hold on, maybe it's impossible, and even if you do,

74
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,080
you don't take it on a deeper level whereby it will make you stop going after it, people can

75
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,200
want to, on a shallow level, on a shallow mental level, they can realize, oh yes, sure, yeah, of course,

76
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,760
I mean, the life is pointless and it's, and you can't really satisfy your desires,

77
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,600
but they won't sink in, why? Because they don't make enough effort for it to sink in,

78
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,720
and why? Because they don't develop their behavior beforehand, as in as in practice virtue,

79
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,240
restraint and see like, then it will sink in, now it can't sink in because their behavior contradicts

80
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,120
it, the behavior goes against it, so no matter how much mentally you might be reflecting about

81
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,440
how the unsatisfying pursuit of desire is there, if your acts are still aimed at the pursuit

82
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,280
of desire, it means like, whatever you're thinking won't be much significant, because there's

83
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,560
no way to land, your actions are just swiping it all away, just pull immediately because they're

84
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,040
still going full power after desires, so you actually have to stop that first, endure that initial

85
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,240
pain, and then these reflections will be able to sink in and land on the proper ground,

86
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:38,960
that you created through restraint,

87
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:55,600
but that's the important thing to remember, the craving to, the desire to fill the gap is basically

88
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:19,120
the result of the desire to fill the gap, because something can lack

89
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:29,760
something else, only in regard to a different thing, if you know what I mean, so a gap is to be

90
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:40,640
filled only in regard to like a filled gap, in itself an empty hole, a gap is a thing in itself,

91
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,400
and there's no desire to be filled, but if you project the assumption of a full hole,

92
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,880
filled hole, leveled hole, completed hole, then this will seem incomplete, and because you

93
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,400
appropriated it, then you feel the pressure of that incompleteness, because you stick your hand

94
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,160
in it, it wasn't yours, you just wanted, you just can't know how to not make it yours,

95
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,360
so then you just become a victim of that pressure of fill it, fill that gap, satisfy the desire,

96
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,440
but in themselves, as I said, I go this well before, and itch, physical itch that you want to scratch,

97
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,360
in itself, it's just an itch, in comparison to the state that it's free of it,

98
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,840
oh, you feel pressure of scratching it, because scratching it might make it stop,

99
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:38,160
take, I'll bring it to an end, which is more pleasant, so then you follow more pleasure basically,

100
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:46,240
ah, so having a non desire, having a satisfied desire, it's more pleasant than having a desire

101
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:55,120
that is not satisfied, that is more unpleasant, and you will always pursue the satisfaction

102
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,680
desire, no matter how futile it is, no matter how much you know that it's futile, you will pursue

103
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,160
it for as long as you hold the assumption of the pleasure that you get through this eyes,

104
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,960
means you always go after it, because it's not, it's based on emotional level, you pursue pleasure,

105
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,760
so feeling a gap, you keep doing it, because you assume that doing it is more pleasant than not

106
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,560
doing it, but you fail to see that through doing it, you maintain that discrepancy,

107
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,080
because you keep projecting the discrepancy that's created by you wanting a pleasurable experience

108
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,040
of a filled gap, as opposed to a gap that's not filled, a hole that it's hollow, that it's empty,

109
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,720
but if you stop holding onto the assumption of a filled gap, then discrepancy won't be hurting you

110
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,320
anymore, thus there is no more pressure of desire, because an empty hole, it's a thing in itself,

111
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,600
a full hole, it's a thing in itself, a perception, yeah, and that's why that's why that's why

112
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,440
it's like in the similarly of scratching the edge, again, you maintain the edge

113
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,600
through constant scratching it, because through scratching it you prevent it from hitting it,

114
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,080
you keep maintaining that discrepancy through your right to scratching, so then it will keep it

115
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,320
ching, that's what I remember before, through pursuit of desire, you maintain desire,

116
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,040
it's as simple as that, it tells us like perceptions in pursuit of perceptions,

117
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,520
yeah, you perceive those are getting involved, the perception of a filled hole,

118
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,800
of a complete desire, it's inciting, it's pleasant, as opposed to doing complete,

119
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,040
and because you crave for pleasure, you go after that perception,

120
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,600
you stop craving for pleasure, then yeah, that is a more agreeable perception, that is a more

121
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,680
disagreeable perception, but none of them need to be appropriately because of that, and none of

122
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,840
them will be appropriate if you sort of relinquish the idea of that sensual pleasure that you get

123
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:04,080
through pursuit of such perceptions, that's why we said it's impossible to engage in sensuality

124
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:11,840
without sensual perceptions, because some people were claiming saying, oh, you can, you know,

125
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,880
you can be free from sensuality and still engage, I don't know, in an intercourse or various things,

126
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,560
because there was loads of brownish anesthetics sort of claiming the ultimate nibbana yet,

127
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,520
you know, having wives or whatever else, it was at least impossible, it's inconceivable to be able

128
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,640
to engage in sensuality, in an act of sensuality, without having those sensual perceptions

129
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,480
established before it, and as I said, the sensual perception are the distortion,

130
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,120
they choose you as such as real, so that's what you have at the time.

131
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:59,680
Here's a, this, a nature, a sub-pire, a sutra, one of six majima, in regard to the base of nothingness,

132
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:08,720
there's three ways to attain the base of nothingness, okay? And so it goes, again, because an

133
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,920
noble disciple considers us sensual pleasures here and now, and sensual pleasures in life,

134
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:22,320
in life to come, sensual pleasures here and now, sensual perceptions here and now, sensual

135
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,280
perceptions in life to come, material forms here and now, material forms in life to come,

136
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,800
perception of forms here and now, perceptions of forms in life to come, perceptions of the impotervable

137
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:43,440
and eger, all are perceptions, where these perceptions cease without remainder, that is peaceful,

138
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,080
they sublime, namely the base of nothingness. When he practices, in this way, in freedom he

139
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,240
abides thus, his mind acquires confidence in this base, once there is full confidence, he either

140
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,160
taint at the base of nothingness, now or else he resolves upon it with wisdom.

141
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,440
Yeah, the standard, you understand it, the rest is a kind of strange translation,

142
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,200
on the dissolution of the body, after death, it is possible that the evolving consciousness,

143
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,200
that's not the dodgy translation, it may pass on to rebirth in the base of nothingness,

144
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,840
this is the first way directed to the base of nothingness,

145
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:31,120
first way that you can attain that base of nothingness, so where these perceptions cease without

146
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,400
remainder, that is peaceful, that's the base of nothingness, so how do you,

147
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,840
where is the, where is that base of nothingness?

148
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,840
Well, perceptions are absent, but that's the thing, see, well, first thing I would point out

149
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,800
in regard to this, see, when he comes to base of nothingness, in similar descriptions,

150
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,600
people immediately assume, and that is thanks to the commentaries and contemporary Buddhism,

151
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,360
people assume it's often meditative attain, it's some sort of blind-town space start state,

152
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,120
but as you can adjust the little passage of that, it's quite clear that it's nothing to do

153
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,120
with that, because he said, he resolves upon wisdom, upon that state, which means you actually

154
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:24,240
understand it, you discern it, and that's not a meditative attainment, you know, in a conventional

155
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,160
sense of that word, it is, you can call that meditation, but that would be the right meditation,

156
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
and also another thing I would point out, the paragraph starts with the normal disciple,

157
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,240
with the right view has to be there, and if the right view is there, even such, again, in

158
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,040
vertical matters, meditative attainments are actually evolving on the right view and wisdom,

159
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,800
because that's what meditation is, cultivation of the right view that you already have beforehand,

160
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,520
so at this particular instance, in terms of the not, well, you can, you don't have to go as far

161
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,160
as the imputable perceptions, the point is, you recognize the nature of perceptions, so that's

162
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,720
where it starts, all the essential, the causes, essential perceptions, here, in the future lives,

163
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,880
then they're the form, the perceptions of form, here, in the future lives, then even the most

164
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:20,080
peaceful perceptions, imputable, regardless of the diversity of the form, the perceptions of

165
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,160
the imputable, means basically what you discern through the nature of perception, because that's it,

166
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,120
what's in common to essential perceptions, the perceptions of form, to the imputable perceptions,

167
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,960
as it says, they're all perceptions, they all share the nature of perception, as an aggregate,

168
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,760
and which means that discernment can be established on their level, perception is there,

169
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,560
you don't care what perception, you don't care if it's diversified or unified, you don't care if

170
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:57,280
it's imputable or not, perceptions, the mind is established upon that, and then, through the discernment

171
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,560
of the nature of perception, you can see, okay, it has a reason, even that sublime, refined,

172
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,400
imputable nature of perception, regardless of the particular manifestations of that perception,

173
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,520
that perception has a reason, as such, it sees without a reminder, when the time comes, and there

174
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,840
is nothing, so that nothingness can, it's sort of perceived in an indirect manner, you can't perceive

175
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,760
nothingness directly, but you can certainly establish your mind in regard to it in an indirect manner

176
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,000
by surmounting the sphere of perception, and that's done through understanding, through, like,

177
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,160
through real, correct, phenomenology, knowledge of phenomena, knowledge of the reason things,

178
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,200
which is what Dhamma is, not through, like, you know, watching the nostrils and then entering

179
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,520
the astral projection of, I don't know what, here is also upon wisdom, here is also upon wisdom,

180
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,720
he said, oh, he resolves upon, yeah, like, either he wants, once there is full confidence,

181
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,800
full confidence establishes his mind, right there and then, which means he's living it and knowing it,

182
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,920
or he fully discerns it and resolves upon wisdom, and then he also knows it.

183
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,160
Let's read the other two ways, because it might fall, again, because a noble disciple

184
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,800
goes, gone to the forest, or to the root of a tree, or 20 years, considers us, this is void

185
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,240
of a self, or what belongs to a self, when he practice in this way and frequently abides us,

186
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:39,120
his mind acquires confidence in this base, and avoidance, and so on, avoid off, so basically,

187
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,920
as I said, the experience, the inner and experience gives priority to the sense of self,

188
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:53,200
but with the right view, and, yeah, you go to physically to an empty room, the dissent,

189
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,840
it's factually empty, and you use that reflection as factual emptiness of this room,

190
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,440
it's the same mirroring situation of the emptiness of the sense of self in this experience,

191
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,520
so, see, it's a negative presence, this room is empty of others,

192
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:19,760
so others are present as absences in this room, others are absent here, so is this body,

193
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,720
so is this mind and so on, absent of this self, so the self is only a negative phenomenon in regard

194
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,440
to it, and if you start seeing it, the statue stops regarding it as yours, and you certainly

195
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,600
stop regarding it as a center of your experience, you're seeing things like the body,

196
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,040
empty yourself, it's not empty of body, it's empty, and it's empty of self,

197
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,560
it's got a room there, it's got a body of feelings there, but it's empty of this,

198
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,760
and that means that this doesn't exist, that's the whole thing,

199
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,640
so now if you say, this room is empty, self doesn't know, itself exists, as an absence,

200
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,600
as a thing that's not there, and that's enough for you to stop regarding it as yours,

201
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,760
and that's all it matters, so that's the phenomenon that you've taken to be yourself,

202
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,000
it's there, it's just not yours, that's a different way of saying that this experience here

203
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,040
is empty of this, my self, so the self is absent, and through that absence I can't own it,

204
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,320
because that absence is present, the absence of self is present,

205
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,600
otherwise you'll be able to designate it and talk about it, but by recognizing it that it's

206
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,680
absent means well it can't be yours, because if it's yours you'll have it all the time, so this is

207
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,840
an empty sense of self, and that's enough for you to stop regarding it as belonging to you,

208
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,040
then he attains the base of nothingness to you, well he attains the base of what

209
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:01,600
voidness is it, well no, once there's full competency he detains to the base of nothingness,

210
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,200
now or else he resolves upon it with wisdom, through the perception of voidness,

211
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,360
yeah, so basically he stops appropriating any perception, this room is empty of self,

212
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,080
thus through not being able to appropriate your sense of self there's nothing that belongs to you,

213
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,520
you resolve upon that, means nothing there arises, nothing manifests, I none of the perceptions

214
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:31,360
arise, no matter how sublime or diversified can be appropriated either, and that's pretty much

215
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:40,480
nothingness, but you can't see nothingness in a direct manner, only by semantic perception,

216
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,280
mind can get established upon nothingness, and you can demand the perception by resolving

217
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,560
upon wisdom of like over the sphere of perception, outside of the perception, and so again,

218
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,320
it's still even the resolving upon wisdom, it's still done, like you establish yourself upon

219
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,200
nothingness in that negative manner, through wisely surmounting the sphere of perception,

220
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,320
but it all revolves on appropriation, you will be the first example you gave of

221
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:16,000
sensuality and different perceptions and so on, impetervable or the voidness, again voidness,

222
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:25,440
oh, okay, it's nothing, nothing's there, nothing is there, nothingness, I was always

223
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,440
once you imagine, nothing, you know, well that's the thing, imagination,

224
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,080
if you mind this development in regard to your, or let's say more correctly, abstraction,

225
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,640
some imagination, because it's kind of based on the facts, but you're not really living those

226
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,600
facts, thus you're just abstract thinking, abstract thinking, it doesn't correspond,

227
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
so if your mind was to be established upon that abstract thinking, you will cease to be abstract,

228
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,400
you will become all, a valid thought that has served to establish your mind,

229
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,160
like what we spoke before, you use more general perceptions to abandon more particular,

230
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,720
more diversified, more troublesome, upon the perceptions of the forests, you abandon perceptions

231
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,960
of the village, which means whatever disturbance arises on account of perceptions of the village

232
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,480
cannot affect you, but the anything disturbance that arises on account of perceptions of the

233
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,760
forest that can still affect you, so you recognize that, so you go even higher,

234
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,640
what is the even greater perception of perception of forests and perception of earth,

235
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,560
so what, then in this case you can go even higher than that, you can say well what is the perception

236
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,920
perception of, the village perception of forest perception of earth,

237
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,640
their old perceptions, and perception is, and the reason thing has to cease, thus whatever

238
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,720
is perceived, whatever arises, has to come to an end, and that is, it is only upon that it's

239
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,720
the experience of nothingness, the perception of nothingness. Well, yeah, you can then start

240
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,440
discerning the perception of that nothing, so to speak, in regard to the positive perspective,

241
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,280
perceptions that you have semantic, because obviously there's a semantic of that perception as well,

242
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:10,720
but yeah, yeah, there is higher than base of nothingness as well. There's a third way to take,

243
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,560
nothingness, basement. Again, because the noble disciples considers us, I am not anything belonging

244
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,320
to anyone, anywhere. Well, what did they say just before? It's all about appropriation,

245
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,440
belonging. Yeah, no, is there anything belonging to me in anyone, anywhere,

246
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,880
yeah. When he practices in this way, if he can hear by and just asks, he's mind acquired confidence

247
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,040
in this base, or just full confidence, he attains to the base of nothingness or result. That's

248
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,640
the most refined way that would be, because it really points out the appropriation, the belonging,

249
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,320
taking as mind, which is what I've been talking about so far. The first one is just

250
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,320
sensuality. What was the other one? Essential perceptions?

251
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,920
Essential pleas. Perceptions of form, and then perceptions of impetervable. Yeah.

252
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,520
All of that already implies me and mind. For the second one, it's a bit more personal, so it's

253
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,200
oh, these perceptions here, this room, as this room is void of others, so this is worry,

254
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,360
but the third one, it's even more pointed out to just that experience of mind, not even necessarily

255
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,640
the fully blown sense of self, but either way, whichever you take, if you develop it, it will

256
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,400
lead you to that surmounting to the point of perception of nothing, that being established

257
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,880
upon perception and nothingness. So by having nothing, like nothing here belongs to me,

258
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,440
or do I belong to anyone, nothing in the future would belong to me, or will I belong to,

259
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,960
nothing in the past has belonged to me, so that's not possible. And it's not possible for anything,

260
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,200
so it's not that I didn't belong to me, but it could. Well, it says nothing in the future,

261
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,920
that's what it means, means a present possibility. So nothing in the future will belong to me,

262
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,840
is it's impossible for things to belong to me, and by truly permeating your whole experience

263
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,840
with that recognition that ownership is inherently impossible.

264
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,480
You surmount the entire sphere of ownership, which is the sphere of perceptions,

265
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,560
the sphere of things that you can perceive, including abstract, remote, ambiguous thoughts,

266
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,960
the appear as such you can add to the idea of ownership as mind, but fully cultivating this attitude,

267
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,960
eventually it will permeate and saturate your experience entirely, in all of its sort of

268
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,160
proliferated branches, so to speak, and that ownership of faith,

269
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,400
is just because you recognize that the only reason you were entertaining the oceans of ownership

270
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:50,400
was by not fully, not emotionally understanding that you were not able to own them in the first place.

271
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,000
That's why you were owning them. You were appropriately in them because you didn't know that you

272
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,560
actually can't. It's appropriation is inconceivable. And the stopping of that pursuit is,

273
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,960
well, it's a result of that. Well, then pursuit will become equally inconceivable,

274
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,720
because the entire nature of pursuit was based upon that misperception.

275
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:30,880
When it goes on, it goes on to say that the base of neither perception or non-perceptions.

276
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:39,520
It's the highest. So, as I said, negative, like what I gave these on before,

277
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,080
the perceptions of forest, when you're in the village, your mind gets established

278
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,760
upon perceptions of the forest, and when you're into the village, that perception of forest becomes

279
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,840
a negative perception in regard to the current perceptions of the village. Because your mind is

280
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,600
still established upon that perception, which is being perceived in a negative manner,

281
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,440
nothing bothers you in the village, which you can perceive, which you might perceive.

282
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,000
Then you recognize, okay, so I don't mean the forest when I'm in the village, if I'm established

283
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,360
upon the perceptions of the forest, I'll be free from disturbing in the village,

284
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,560
but not from the disturbance in the forest. And then the negative perception in regard to the

285
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,240
forest and the village further down, it's the perception of earth, the entire earth, the element of earth.

286
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,960
But that's a negative perception in regard to these more particular perceptions,

287
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,640
or you can see more general perception. But it's a negative when you're perceiving other things.

288
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,120
So, it's not there, it's present as an absent perception, and that's ultimately nothingness.

289
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,400
She is that very nature, of that very principle. Quiet to me. Oops, sorry.

290
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,480
So through cultivating the negative perception, you might get resolved upon it and establish

291
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,400
in it. But even that is a perception in that negative manner, in that indirect manner, it's still

292
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,680
our perception. Thus, neither perception or not perception would be state that goes even

293
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:13,280
beyond that perception, of nothingness, of the absence, of the absence of the general yet.

294
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,600
So as this village is absent of any forest, the perceptions of forest,

295
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,920
so is this entire body that are now using this particular level walking through a village,

296
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:40,880
is also absent of any owner, of any self that actually owns it, or are the more specifically,

297
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,320
more precisely, as the third example says, of any belonging to the sense of self,

298
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,360
or whatever arises in regard to it. Thus, the sense of self, or rather that which is taking

299
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,080
to be the sense of self stays there, but it loses its ownership, loses its belonging thus,

300
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:10,800
it's not really self anymore, so it's not yourself. And then you can surmount

301
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,640
negative perception and no perception through the entire cessation of perception and feeling.

302
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:30,320
I can't. Because it asserts when that big, when that big, who clings, assumes.

303
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,480
He assumes to the best object of assumption, because he is the best object of assumption,

304
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,880
namely the base, neither perception. Because if you assume, if your upadana is based upon

305
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,160
neither perception or perception, meaning the mind has been developed to such an extended,

306
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,360
connection descendant state, which means all of the more diversified states have been abandoned,

307
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,760
and you cannot entertain any notions of ownership in regard to them. In the same sense,

308
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,080
when you learn, and you get established upon the perceptions of forest and wilderness,

309
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,160
the idea of a crowded place, the mind just will not go there.

310
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:16,000
But imagine if you establish it to such a fine point, refinement whereby you surmount the perception

311
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:26,560
in its entirety. Well, that is a sublime. And yeah, you can assume that, you can be kind of

312
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,600
entertaining certain assumptions in regard to that, but that means that all the other assumptions,

313
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,360
all of it. Not just the course ones, even the ones that regard the relatively non-course have been

314
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,640
abandoned. So yeah, that is the place. If you want to cling to something, develop your mind and

315
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,320
cling to them freely, because actually there isn't much there to cling onto.

316
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,960
Yeah, there's a result of that. You will abandon all the other more dangerous assumptions.

317
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,480
Yeah, because it says when someone is practicing for nibbana, they need to abandon that.

318
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,600
Yeah, here because practicing thus, it might not be, and it might not be for me, it will not be,

319
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,760
and it will not be for me, what exists, what has come to be. That's basically abandoning.

320
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,880
Yeah, so there is, developing that reflection. They are not just, because as we said before,

321
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,320
so yeah, it's not just the faith that you can on now, faith is to recognise that even a possibility

322
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,200
of ownership cannot occur. Because you might think, okay, I don't know anything now,

323
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,640
but you can still entertain implicitly, or I'll testively assume within that,

324
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,040
ambiguous, simply assume by not looking at it. You end up assuming that

325
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,960
tiny little remote possibility of ownership is still might be possible.

326
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:02,000
And you will entertain that by default, simply by not entertaining it, but not looking at that

327
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,160
possibility as impossible, you will automatically entertain the notion of that possibility.

328
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:16,080
So, the reflection, it might not be, it will not even be possible for it to be for me, let alone

329
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:25,600
be for me now. So, you really pervade, so to speak, the whole sphere of nature of possibility,

330
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,800
which is much subtler than anything a reason present in front of you. So, I have this present

331
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,320
thing, I don't know anything, but you still entertain the possibility of ownership.

332
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,680
Even if you never give in to it, you might entertain it for the rest of your life,

333
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,560
but if you want to pay this for Nirvana, an ultimate relic, you start really targeting,

334
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,480
so to speak, those possibilities. Because, okay, it's obvious I don't own anything in front of me

335
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,320
around me, anything in the past, see I couldn't have kept it, but you can still cherish tiny little

336
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:05,040
notion of maybe just the possibility of ownership as an abstract idea, even that, but that will be the

337
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,200
point that you're touching, the point that you're interfering with, the point that you didn't let go of.

338
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:19,120
But if you practice, it will not be, it cannot be for me, it's impossible for it to be for me,

339
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,120
it's just inconceivable, no matter what, when in the future, how far, how long in the future,

340
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:31,440
it's just, it's impossible for this domain to touch, to come together and establish belonging,

341
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,480
it's inconceivable. And you practice that long enough, presently, right here, right now,

342
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,400
in regard to the future possibilities, and, yeah, that is Nirvana.

343
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,960
Yes, well, again, this is what I meant, but again, the possibility is,

344
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,600
the possibility is, yeah, okay. And as you can see, that gap can obviously stretch to

345
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,960
very refined levels, you know, you can, you can surmount, and even protrusion, I can surmount the gap

346
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:16,880
of sensual craving, but the gap of, like the future, only like the possibility of ownership can still

347
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:27,600
be very much maintained. But by recognizing that that gap is insurmountable, that it's impossible

348
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:34,960
to fail, impossible to bridge, you stop trying to build a bridge, you will keep trying to build a

349
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,720
bridge, for as long as you think it's possible for it to work, it's possible to build it,

350
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:46,160
you remove it, or rather you remove the hope, the notion of that possibility, you fully understand

351
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,080
it as, oh no, this is impossible. And then all the efforts to build a bridge, just, you don't have

352
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:58,400
to then, you automatically, they stop, they disappear. But all the key thing is all the suffering

353
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,760
ends. Of course, then, yeah, yeah. Because the result of the suffering was craving for the bridge,

354
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,200
and you think that the bridge will give it all the suffering, but in fact,

355
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,160
but you were suffering because of you were basically trying to build that bridge, trying to gap,

356
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,000
trying to surmount, trying to cross, that's which is impossible to, trying to connect that which is

357
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:38,560
well, in connectable, yeah. And as you can see, simply through thinking that it is possible

358
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,440
to build a bridge over that gap, of your existence, you appropriate it, you appropriate the other

359
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:52,000
sure, you appropriate the possibility of being on the other side, where that bridge is built,

360
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,920
and the whole thing has been, has been filled and connected and unified. But through seeing,

361
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,160
now this is impossible, you stop entertaining the notions of, or the other side of the gap,

362
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,960
of ownership. And you can see, through ownership, you maintain the notion of building a,

363
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,080
of crossing, of building a bridge, or through the efforts of building a bridge, the assumption that

364
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:22,080
it's possible to be able to fill that gap, you keep, you keep assuming the ownership of,

365
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,240
of the result of filling that gap, of that, of that other side, that you can cross here and

366
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,440
not bridge it, yeah. So even if you, yeah, even if you don't necessarily try and hear it now,

367
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,320
even in practicing restraint, the failure you maintain in the notion that it is possible to connect

368
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,960
with that other, at the side of that gap, means you are still very much within the assumption.

369
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
You're choosing not to. Even if you're choosing not to, yeah, you still own the other show,

370
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,720
through the possibility of, oh, I can cross there, to building this bridge over this insurmountable gap.

371
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,680
You fully descend, it's insurmountable, you reckon that was, that is peace, the peace was not

372
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,440
unifying broken pieces or whatever else, the peace was abandoning them all.

373
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,160
Because if you have broken pieces of a vase, for as long as you hold onto the perceptions of a vase,

374
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,560
those pieces will be, well, will be valuable, will be useful, it will be

375
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,640
object of your effort to bring back the vase, to build it up as it was before, or whatever notions

376
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,000
you might entertain, or emotional attachment towards it. But if you say, I don't care about it

377
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,800
anymore, all those pieces become literally worldless, entirely. So when you, and especially when

378
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,800
you recognize that you can't have the vase, and well, you couldn't have had it, because if it was

379
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,320
truly your vase all the time, you wouldn't have been broken in the first place. You have been

380
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,520
full control over it, but it's independent of you. In the same sense, this gap that you're trying

381
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,720
to surmount by pursuing your designs, it's independent of you, thus it's insurmountable, thus only

382
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,480
through the notions of surmounting it, you are yourself fully responsible for maintaining the constant

383
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,880
presence of the desire. You stop maintaining that desire of fate, causing these maintenance.

384
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,320
That's when you really said, the object of desire is more desire.

385
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:18,960
So the sole purpose of desire is the presence of desire.

386
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,200
You don't see that, because desire kind of tricks you by projecting your look. That's what

387
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,200
you're desiring for, so you don't see the nature of desire, because you're focused on a particular

388
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,440
manifestation of it. You know that desire is ready for food. Yeah, desire is filled by itself,

389
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,440
by being a desire. That's fine with itself, only through the discrepancy which you then assume

390
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:51,120
feels incomplete, but your full response is there for that. So you know how people, the notion

391
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,680
is there's a desire, and obviously there's a projected discrepancy of a fulfilment of desire.

392
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,800
If I do this and this and this, my desire will be fulfilled. So then you crave for that,

393
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:07,440
and that's how you maintain the notion of desire. So you could equally, so to speak,

394
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:16,240
fulfill your desire by forgetting about your desire. So you feel like, oh if I pursue my desire,

395
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,440
I fulfill my desire. Equal to that pursuit, you could equally do that, just forget about your

396
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,960
desire, and your desire will be equally fulfilled, because you must fulfill to begin with desire in

397
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,160
itself, it's a very phenomenal reason and such, perfectly sufficient by itself in itself.

398
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,960
But the discrepancy created is in regard to another projected scenario that it's incomplete in

399
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,320
regard to this, but in itself it's quite complete. So if you were to forget about the scenario,

400
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:51,520
the discrepancy is forgotten about, thus desire is complete. It's easy, it's gone.

401
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,840
It's just forgetful, you can't just forget. Well no, what I mean, forgetting about desire,

402
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:02,560
it's restrained. Yeah. Because by restraining, you stop pursuing it and then it falls off and

403
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,800
then you start thinking about something else. Yeah. Oh my desire. Oh, if you can, if you can

404
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,200
selectively forget only about desires, but don't forget about your forgetting, that's all right.

405
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,640
Yeah, we fulfill all your desires by restraining. Yeah, yeah, it would, they would be true for

406
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:30,160
family, it would bring all desires to an end to the cessation. So you cure your age by not

407
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:39,440
ditching, by not scratching, because scratching makes his making worse. Is that simple? It's just

408
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,560
most people are not strong enough to persist in non-scratching.

409
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,000
But the reason they're not strong enough is because they don't practice, they don't develop strength,

410
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:01,360
and thus, they're fully responsible for being weak, for being unable to restrain. Thus, they're

411
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:08,320
fully responsible for being poor by their desire. Yeah, I was, I was going to the beginning of that

412
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:16,480
sutra, the nature, supine, and it would have started with the biggest, central pleasures,

413
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,200
impermanent, hollow, false, deceptive. They are illusory. The Prattle of Fools.

414
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,720
Central pleasures here and now, and central pleasures in life to come, central pleasures,

415
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,880
perceptions here and now, central perceptions in life to come. Both alike are Mara's realm,

416
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,440
Mara's domain, Mara's bait, Mara's hunting ground. When I count to them, these evil unwholesome

417
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:49,120
mental states such as covetousness, evil will, and presumption arise, and they constitute an

418
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,160
obstruction to a noble disciple in training here. I don't know what presumption is.

419
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Well, I don't know what a parable it is. If he traces it, I know that. It doesn't matter,

420
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,920
you get a context from the other. But when he, when a Biku considers our central pleasures here and

421
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,880
now, and so on, constitutes an obstruction in the training, suppose I go to abide with the

422
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,960
mind abundant and exalted, having transcended the world and made a firm determination with the mind.

423
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,320
When I do so, there will be no more un-evil unwholesome mental states.

424
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,920
And with the bending of their mind, my mind will be unlimited, immeasurable and well-developed.

425
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,480
When he practices in this way, and frequently abides us, his mind acquires confidence in this

426
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,720
place. And they become the know. The inter... the know.

427
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:50,160
Yeah, it requires development. And that's how from abstraction is brought down to the actuality.

428
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,040
If you read the first time, oh, it's his abstract, but if you actually start pondering,

429
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,760
discerning, establishing and understanding upon it, and then you abide in it frequently enough,

430
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,400
it becomes a know. And it becomes a state that your mind is attained.

431
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,160
It could also, I think she says, it is maras.

432
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,160
Maras fear.

433
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,120
It's maras stuff, those perceptions.

434
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,880
And what is maras thing?

435
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,520
And what does he mean by saying this is maras? It means it's not yours. It means it cannot be yours.

436
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,640
It means it's owned by another.

437
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:29,760
By mara. That's what it is. It's because people take them which belongs to mara.

438
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,720
Mara does with them what he wants. What do they take?

439
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,360
Or rather, what is it that belongs to mara? It says, I belongs to mara.

440
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,080
I phones belong to mara. Here belongs to mara. Sounds belong to mara.

441
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,200
Well, both the perceptions and the interity belongs to mara.

442
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,720
There would be someone saying that there is a self and there is a there.

443
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,400
No, there is a self, but it's not yours.

444
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,520
It's maras. Mara is the ultimate self.

445
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,440
She just had to stop regarding it as my end has this way.

446
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,160
The thing says, stop regarding that it is possible to be yours.

447
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,280
Even if you're not taking it, it might be possible.

448
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,960
You should start thinking, no, it will not be possible.

449
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,280
It is not possible. It cannot be possible.

450
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,680
So whenever the good it talks about the future and in this certain, it says,

451
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,200
any it will not be for me in the future.

452
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,480
Central pleasures here and now are central pleasures to come.

453
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,640
It doesn't matter. It's possibility of central pleasures.

454
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,600
It's equally impossible to be mine as much as these present central pleasures are.

455
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,760
And through abandon that possibility, you actually abandon the present.

456
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,840
Not that way around, because possibility is subtly than there is in actual aspects.

457
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,920
More general, possible it is more general. They are on the more general level here.

458
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:14,400
So the sense of self in regard to your senses, in regard to experience as a whole,

459
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,000
it's appropriate. It's regard dear and personal. It's welcomed, it's cherished, it's protected.

460
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,640
You do the opposite. You let go of it, you dismantle it,

461
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,680
you see that it's impossible to own it. And then that very sense of self, it's right here right now

462
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,000
in the center of your experience, no matter how vague it is, that sense of self, that's mara.

463
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:44,560
Right here, in your core, which wasn't your core. It was his core and it was his all the time.

464
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,600
That's how much I say, mara, I see you, I see you, you're doing this, I can see you.

465
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,040
They see themselves thinking that, but they know, because that's not appropriate anymore.

466
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,680
It's a mara, that's self is a mara, and that is his control, that is his domain, that's where

467
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,400
you control all the beings, because they're appropriate, that which is his, that which is him.

468
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:20,800
So it's his mara, just another way of saying it, it's like religion, it will be, well definitely.

469
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,040
Yeah, it's just basically, of Egypt personified.

470
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,240
Yeah, so you mean, so you don't see that's the thing, of Egypt personified,

471
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,160
but you don't, you can't get rid of that personification, because there will be a

472
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,960
appropriation of it. If you were to truly be able to get rid of the personality, so to speak,

473
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,200
means, well, there will be a person, you will be in control of it, but you can't.

474
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,400
So what we can do is stop regarding it as your own, and that is actually true, get rid of,

475
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,560
getting rid of. And that's when that personality, if it is owned, cannot be owned,

476
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,440
fully understood, discern that you cannot possibly own it, that's when it just becomes manifested

477
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,080
in the individuality, of these five aggregates arising, certain manners based on certain habits,

478
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:16,960
certain dry-up notions or whatever else, but no more, no more obedience, certainly, no more

479
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:25,600
person as in belonging to you or to anyone. This does not belong to me, nor to anyone, it's impossible

480
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:32,880
for it to belong. That's why Mara still comes to Buddha. Yeah, exactly, because that is Mara's

481
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,200
domain, but the Buddha is not there, so Mara can see it, or Mara can't see it in Aranya,

482
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,320
because he's just not there anymore, ever, even as a possibility, Aranya is not there anymore.

483
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:52,560
It's impossible for him to be there anymore, where Mara can see, where that personality can take

484
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,600
a grip of him again, it's impossible. The mind is what will be on it.

485
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,040
It's quite straightforward in a way, if the mind is developed to the proper discernment of

486
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:18,000
an arisenomy, be it a thought, a feeling, a perception of this kind of that kind, it's a reason.

487
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,760
You start training with that, well, all of these things will kind of fit into place.

488
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,640
And again, there's nothing to do with watching a nostrils and entering the mystical absorption

489
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:48,240
states. It resolves upon the wisdom. So, it resolves upon it with wisdom.

490
00:51:48,240 --> 00:52:03,360
Do me a boy, come here. I like the way the Buddha, the sutras, ended.

491
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,040
And when he says this, this is meditator under, do not delay, or else you will regret it later.

492
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,680
Because there is no reason delay. You can't only try here right now, and that possibility of

493
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:25,680
future ownership is present right here right now. So, delaying it means obstructing it unnecessarily.

494
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:37,680
So, don't do it. Really, don't delay. Why for? The delay would come from that misperception that,

495
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:45,360
I would say, you got the sensuality, distortion. That's where delay comes from.

496
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,040
We have to keep on to maintain itself. The matter was to maintain it. It is controlled.

497
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,920
So, people think their thoughts are abstract, but it's actually other way around.

498
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,280
It's experience, present experience right here, that it's abstract in regard to thoughts.

499
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,880
Thoughts come first, mind comes first. But because, as I said before, because your experience

500
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,080
or potusion is so centered around the center self, that is the center of the universe.

501
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,280
Me and mine, I am the reference point to everything. That's the real.

502
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,720
That's the real, which means you're always bound with the senses, with the sensual,

503
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,480
with the material aspects of things and so on. Means that becomes your norm.

504
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,760
So, then even the most ordinary thoughts are regarded as, oh, this is just abstract,

505
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:46,960
because every thought seems abstract. I abstract it from your current experience that you're used to.

506
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,560
Thoughts seem almost unreal. That's where many people think thoughts are not real. I just

507
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:57,440
think my head. Because they got so bogged down in the sensual aspect of their experience,

508
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:04,800
their minds are so down in that domain, that sort of lowly sphere, that even the mere thinking

509
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:11,760
feels abstract. But that's only because they're so used to this sphere of sensual,

510
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,200
sphere of senses and domain of senses and control of senses. If somebody is to point out to you,

511
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,840
that as the wrong way around, to turn the picture upside down, and which is first,

512
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,400
you were putting second, well, somebody corrects that. Then you reckon, no, thoughts are the real,

513
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,520
thoughts are the center. The nature of thoughts, I don't mean just thinking any sort of nonsense

514
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,560
in regard to your senses. I mean, the nature of thoughts is the center of your experience,

515
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,720
and it's your experience that you're living, that is the abstraction from that.

516
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,200
If you stop doing, if you stop maintaining that abstraction, if you acknowledge the nature of

517
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:56,000
thoughts as present things that you could just designated, you will stop living that discrepancy,

518
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:04,720
that which is abstraction, which means by basically, by freeing yourself of the notions of abstraction

519
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,680
in regard to your own experience, you will be suffering less because they will be less discrepancy

520
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:19,680
created for such notions. So for Protuginum, thoughts are real. The rest of his experience

521
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,840
is an abstraction. It's a big mistake. It's a distortion, as the Buddha said, in terms of sensuality.

522
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,200
And because they're so bound with that distortion, they think that's the real thing.

523
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,400
And then that, which is, doesn't match it, in regard as well, this is abstracted from it.

524
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,480
You say, if I have the thought of nothing as thought of impermanable, the thought,

525
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,840
the image is the thought. If you dismiss it as just a thought, well, as I said before, you don't

526
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:55,520
just shoot yourself in a foot, you shoot yourself in the head, unless you seriously change the notion

527
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,400
because you'll never then recognize the nature of thoughts, which means you'll never then

528
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:07,200
recognize the nature of your mind, because mind is thoughts, tamas. I mean, damma, the capital D

529
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:15,120
is the knowledge of tamas, like the small D. It's the phenomenology, the knowledge of phenomena.

530
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,080
But if you dismiss anything that appears in your mind as just an abstraction,

531
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,880
you'll never look at it, which means you remain bogged down in sensuality, which is what you

532
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:37,120
have at the time of dismissal. Oh, you dismiss any helping hand, you're just going to stay drowning.

533
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,760
So when you have notions of the, nothingness, what we spoke about, that feels abstract in

534
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,040
regard to where your mind is, because your mind hasn't been developed. So don't dismiss it on

535
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:00,560
that account. Just start developing it in regard to that, which feels abstract. Because the

536
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:05,120
money development, the more you know about it, the less of that discrepancy will be maintained,

537
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:10,880
which means the less of the abstraction you will be living. So then you will understand,

538
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,280
and you will be able to think nothingness right away, and have your mind set upon it.

539
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:24,400
And as I said with the alternative option is, depending on person's background,

540
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:30,640
it is, he resolves upon it with wisdom. That means he doesn't necessarily need to

541
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:38,480
develop it and make it actual to the full extent, because he has such a precise wisdom

542
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:45,200
that when people would think abstractly, he would think correctly. Well, he would think,

543
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,920
the person has always been, would stand for that with nothing that is, and he would know that,

544
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,840
even without actually being there. So he resolves upon that with his wisdom. He resolves,

545
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,960
it is that. That is what nothingness is. And he resolves upon it. And because that is what nothing

546
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,600
ness really is, he gets results of freedom that would come by being established upon that nothingness.

547
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,200
And that is pain in liberty, that is deliberately liberated by wisdom. He resolves upon it with wisdom,

548
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,560
stays very long enough, all the fetters fall off. Then you have the other way,

549
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,800
he is liberating them both in both ways. We experience who touches it with the body as the

550
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,280
suttas will describe. That is when that discrepancy between living body and the senses,

551
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:38,960
not full faith. It is fully developed. Sorry, fully semantic, fully extinguished. But abstract,

552
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,880
it is only abstract, if that discrepancy is created by what you are used to, that doesn't match that

553
00:58:44,880 --> 00:59:00,160
with your thinking. What is it? What is it? What is it? No, we can't go for a walk now.

554
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:22,720
Okay, take a crack, get out. Okay, go. Good boy. No, it was just done. Okay, now give it to the monkey.

555
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,160
So if some of your thinking feels abstract, don't dismiss the thinking, just take that,

556
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:42,160
oh, there is a work to be done. It's abstract only because my present experience, present bodily

557
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:47,040
experience doesn't match it. Can't comprehend it. Well, comprehend it and you'll match it.

558
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:52,320
But the abstract thought of nothingness is a sign. It's still a valid direction.

559
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,240
Based to what you read about nothingness. Like say somebody completely different,

560
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:05,280
doesn't follow any dharma, starts talking about nothingness. Well, then even that abstract thought

561
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,360
of that nothingness, these other different different different school teachers talking about,

562
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,640
won't necessarily be the right direction either because it's so much off. But if you read the

563
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,240
sutras and when the Buddha talks about nothingness, having the faith in the Buddha and so on,

564
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,680
then well, you can be pretty certain that you might not have experienced nothingness,

565
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,840
have certainly not been established upon it, but you can be pretty certain that at least the

566
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:35,440
direction where a abstract thought took you, it's probably the right one. Because it's, you know,

567
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,960
it's so vague in general, you really need to be seriously misled by instruction to go off that.

568
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,720
Now of course, there is a lot of work to go into that direction. But as I said, by reading the

569
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:54,000
sutras, you can be rest assured that, well, at least the directions through your abstract thinking

570
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,200
that you are getting in terms of the instructions are probably slightly right, which is why it's

571
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:06,320
important to have the right instruction, no matter how general it is. Now if you were not

572
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:12,560
to read the sutras, you could some other stuff where the present is Buddhism or not. Thank you

573
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:19,600
throw you off completely. But in this case, the sutras, the sutras, when you read, and that's why

574
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,160
if you keep reading about the sutras, you will be out any other input or explanation. If you,

575
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:29,520
obviously, with this kind of view, okay, abstract thinking is a direction that I need to develop

576
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:37,360
where it is, is to be abstract. Then if you keep reading the sutras, that direction will crystallize

577
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:42,160
more and more, because you'll be thinking about it, you'll be pondering it, you'll be, as the

578
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,120
others say, you'll be investigating meaning, you wouldn't believe me anything and turned, so you'll

579
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:52,080
be working basically, you'll be walking in the beginning like it then you go east, so you just

580
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:58,080
are going east, but you can go far off in many directions that are east, but you still keep going,

581
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:02,480
which means the further you go, it will start narrowing down, then you get more signs, more

582
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,640
instructions, then you recognize more of previous instructions that you heard that you couldn't make

583
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,080
much of at the time, which means your direction will get more and more focused and pointed out,

584
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:20,240
which means you get more precise. But none of that would be possible, if you admit, sorry,

585
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:28,400
if you dismissed the abstract thinking, it is very arising because it's just thinking,

586
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,240
it's just abstract, this is real, that's abstract, no, that's equally real, it's abstract only in

587
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,280
regard to what you think it's more real and you're a professional, thus you should not be trusting

588
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,240
what you think that it's more real, because if that is truly the real thing, you wouldn't be

589
01:02:44,240 --> 01:03:11,200
trusting, you wouldn't be free from suffering, you wouldn't be allowed.

590
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,280
So don't dismiss abstract thinking, try to point it in the right direction through

591
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,560
leading settlers and things that are at least likely to be wrong, and then keep bringing.

592
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,040
Like, that's what I mean when I tell you, I have to be able to explain things to yourself,

593
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:37,840
don't leave them vague, undefined, yeah, it feels like this, sort of feels like, no, what does it mean?

594
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:44,880
No either meaning means understanding it, knowing that there is nothing to be understood in

595
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,600
these particular things means you understand them, and they are not worth understanding of pursuing

596
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:57,200
further. So that's why by reading this with this economy, you should be able to explain to

597
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:03,040
yourself, okay, so it still feels abstract when I think about nothingness, but what it is, what is

598
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,960
my, what is the meaning of it for me to that, at that point? What does it mean? How did I understand it?

599
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,720
It doesn't mean you start going to some like psychotherapy, spiritual terminology where you

600
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,760
should just start a while, it's like this, and it feels like, and it feels, no, what does it mean?

601
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,520
I'm not asking this guy how you feel, what does it mean? Where is your understanding yet?

602
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:33,040
And most importantly, is that understanding contributing to a freedom of suffering and freedom from

603
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:40,960
possibility to suffer? That is present. And if the understanding pertains to that, if understanding

604
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:48,400
feels directly related or directly correlated to the freedom from suffering, then carry on.

605
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,920
But if it's irrelevant, oh, I feel like this, or I feel like that, well, they make some

606
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,640
difference. Feelings there, that's your suffering regarding your feelings. Well, I feel,

607
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,040
I feel like, superman today, I feel untouchable, I feel impertellable. Well, great,

608
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:05,520
what are you going to do when you're feeling ceases? So you just establish your peace upon your

609
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:12,960
feeling, yet the whole problem of not being free, not being peaceful, is depending upon feelings,

610
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,880
being affected by them.

611
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:22,480
Yeah, that's up to you. No, that's not your peteo, that's what I mean. So don't just

612
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,960
give into any kind of flamboyant description of what you might feel like when you think about

613
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,960
nothingness. No, actually, develop it, so you don't suffer on a count of it. Otherwise,

614
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,920
the weather wouldn't have laid it as a way out of suffering. So if it doesn't pertain to a

615
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,360
freedom from suffering, means you're doing it wrong, or it's a wrong instruction, but it's

616
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,720
since came from the weather. It's not the wrong instruction, that's you're doing it wrong.

617
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:52,960
So it's always a good criteria of, okay, I've been pursuing this line of thinking in regard to

618
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,200
base of nothingness. I've been dwelling on the notions of this. Can I know, can I suffer less

619
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,480
on a count of it? And just like you, you're intelligence, you could see, this seems that if I were to

620
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,920
develop it, I would be untouchable by the unpleasant feeling when it rises, because they would also,

621
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,720
because feeling is inseparable from perception, and if I'm entirely surmounting the perception,

622
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,360
and free from it, and established in that base that's higher than that perception, none of the

623
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,600
feelings that arise on the count of that perception that can perceive can affect me because they

624
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,240
will pertain to perception, not to me, because I'm out of that perception.

625
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,160
So, yeah, it is strange.

626
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:43,440
Or even less extra. I mean, it's abstract for somebody who just reminds us far removed from it,

627
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,320
but again, as a thought, as a valid direction, it must not be dismissed in any cost.

628
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,560
Even if you don't necessarily follow it to such an extent, you can just go back to the obvious one,

629
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:57,440
upon the perceptions of the forest, your abandoned perceptions of the village, perceptions of

630
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:03,760
the crowded life, perceptions of the people, perceptions of centrality, to see the perceptions,

631
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,320
which have the flavor of freedom, the taste of it, isn't it?

632
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:16,000
Yeah, these perceptions are not clearly developed them, but it seems to me, based on my

633
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,160
limited discernment at this point, they're more likely to result in freedom than perceptions

634
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:28,240
of hanging on the village. So then, I should follow them. And then by following them,

635
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,040
you can close it to other perceptions that are there. And then you actually, oh yeah, no,

636
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:40,240
I was right. Where you define your taste of freedom, you gain confidence in the taste of freedom.

637
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,800
And then you know, oh, it is free.

638
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:55,920
Because if abstract thinking of freedom would stand for that, which freedom actually is freedom

639
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:02,080
from craving, freedom of suffering, what you have to do is keep repeating it, and you will be

640
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:06,560
resolved upon it. You're walking in that direction. Well, no, you'll be resolved upon it,

641
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,160
which means everything will be dragged into that direction, the rest of your experience,

642
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:15,920
because you anchored it there, and give it some time, and all the factors will follow.

643
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,600
And then you realize, yeah, this was right, even as an abstract thought, he was very accurate.

644
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,640
He's just always, I was dismissing it, because I was so centered at the opposite end.

645
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:33,200
But fortunately, out of faith and persistence, I kept doing it, and I headed the route,

646
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:38,480
and I headed anchor there, and look, all this, all this experience that was bogged down in

647
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:45,840
sensuality, the mind that was fully controlled, and just disturbed, and abused by centrality,

648
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:50,400
and everything else has been dragged out, and look, now it's there, where any perturbing ball is,

649
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,800
and all that swamp is abandoned. And that's abstract now.

650
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,440
You're thinking about sensuality, that you have full understood, as pretty much inconceivable,

651
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:10,160
it's impossible to own, that's abstract thinking, because you're abstracted from it.

652
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:26,960
So you can see how much harm can be caused by the casual Buddhist advice that you often read

653
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,520
and hear, or just stop thinking. Ignoring all the contradictions that are

654
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,360
said, sentence will imply, oh yeah, thoughts are the problem, I stopped thinking, and I'm at peace.

655
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:48,800
And you'll never try to think properly, and you certainly will never be able to, well,

656
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:55,760
to think, to develop your mind. And again, when I say things, I don't mean just sit and theorize,

657
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,760
or rationalize, what makes sense to you in your protrusion ascent that experience around your senses,

658
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:08,480
well, that the thinking is slave to the senses, but it's the other way around, or it should be, at least.

659
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,600
So developing the thinking is based on the suitors, however abstract, don't dismiss it,

660
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,720
but actually pursue their direction, and then it will cease to be abstract.

661
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,200
One thing for sure, none of these states,

662
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:27,680
it's based on nothingness, based on either perception or perception, one intent upon divana will be

663
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:36,480
arising by a chance, given to you by some meditative technique that kind of just made these things happen.

664
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,720
No, you develop them through discerning what they are, so then if you're a thought of what they

665
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,600
are, is accurate thought, that's it, you're rooted in them, now you have to keep doing it,

666
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,640
long enough until the fetters fade, that's the right view, the right view is the knowledge of

667
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,880
me, knowledge of freedom from suffering. Now you can pursue it or you can choose to be distracting

668
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,880
in regard to it, but you can't forget about it. So at most, in several lifetimes, you'll do away

669
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:13,520
with all the fetters, but maybe even before. Yeah, that's what it talks about, sort of patterns,

670
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,480
being reborn, no, all of them need to sit through seven lifetimes, some of them become lions,

671
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:24,880
before they land into another river, so like a loose translation, or a pond landing,

672
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,280
or in the space in between, all those polythumes, which means you could have taken to different

673
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:38,480
faculties and then even in that state in between, you carry on, you carry on the development of

674
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:46,000
the right view. Yeah, so at most, several lifetimes, but not necessarily. It's depending on how much

675
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,640
effort, how much effort you put into it. Yeah, how accurate your thoughts of what

676
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,560
nibane is actually are, because there is no, and that's one thing you realize,

677
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,720
what you think nibane is can be right or wrong, but you can't have a reference point

678
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:07,920
to it externally whereby you see, okay, there is a nibane and now I can correct my thinking, no,

679
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,400
because you can only see it from the inside, so you will know that this is the right thinking

680
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,480
when you're fully free from suffering, and then you're okay. That's why sometimes anagami

681
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,000
overestimated themselves, they thought they were fully nibane, but they were not quite,

682
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,280
because the things get a bit subtler later on, in terms of conceit and so on, so some people might

683
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,800
not necessarily see if the circumstances are not prompting them to see it, but the point is,

684
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:36,240
you can't have an external view of anything, which means then your abstract thinking,

685
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:42,640
or non abstract thinking, is all you have to stand for that thing, which you're aiming at for freedom.

686
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:47,680
That's what I meant in the S in not perceiving the feeling and determined determinations,

687
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:53,760
that because of which you have thoughts of that, because of which you have thoughts,

688
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,160
which means you can only think in regard to that, which you're thinking, but that's already

689
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,000
another thought that you're thinking, which means you can't step outside of your thought,

690
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,400
right along where you should dismiss it. So all you have to do then is make sure you stop assuming

691
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:15,520
that thought to be that, which it isn't, and then that thought will stand for that, which that

692
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:23,680
thought is. In other way, have an accurate thought of what nibane is, have an accurate thought of

693
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:28,080
what the way out of suffering is, have an accurate thought of what craving is, have an accurate

694
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:32,240
thought of what matter is, have an accurate thought of what feeling is, have an accurate thought

695
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,760
of what perception is, have an accurate thought of what intentions are, have an accurate thought of

696
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:41,600
what consciousness is. Because through any inaccurate thought, you introduce assumption,

697
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,680
because that's it, the discrepancy of inaccuracy is the extent of your assumption,

698
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:57,680
extent of your opinion.
