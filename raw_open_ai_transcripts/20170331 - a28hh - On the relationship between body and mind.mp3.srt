1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
Yes, the other day you were talking about experience, you used the example of experiences

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,080
looking, experiences like looking into the mirror, remember you were explaining, it's

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,280
like a mirror, it's like a mirror, and that.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:32,360
Well, I do remember the context, no, I forgot the context, it's basically about, ah, no,

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,600
not like a mirror, but more, okay, yes, like a mirror, like you can't see or access from

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:46,240
directly, but you can recognize, or you can experience is the appearance of it, which

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,680
is basically, ah, like a mirror image of that, which is mirrored, but you can only, whatever

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,280
you look, it will be looking at that mirror, in other words, you can't look away from

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
the mirror, or from that reflection, and see the thing that's been reflected, all you

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,120
can get is the reflected of the matter.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,920
So your number, it's basically the reflect, as the only thing that sort of arises, it's

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,240
the old, the old, ah, the, the reason thing, ah, basically that's because of which, sorry,

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,320
matter is that, because of which this number will arise, which means, it's because of

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,480
that matter, but see, when you say that matter, that already belongs to that, that designation

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,640
belongs to that number, which means it belongs to that, ah, reflected image.

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:39,640
So you all, the only way to, to, to know, ah, that, ah, matter is there, is to discern,

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,480
so you can't see through the senses, it doesn't appear directly, so basically by fully understanding

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,320
number, you then discern, the number, it's because of that, which does not appear, but

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,720
it's there, as a necessary condition, what appears, that which appears, if anything ever

20
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,920
appears, it will appear within number, which means, there's the only way to appear,

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,160
which means that's what appears and sees, ah, but then appearance will not be there, if

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,640
there is no matter, to support the appearance, but you can never see the matter, even when

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,600
you think about the matter, you think within the realm of designation, which means, you're

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,600
thinking is part of that number, but when that's, that one, so it says, ah, as it's about

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,440
conceitings, whatever you conceit, it's always other than that, ah, yeah, whatever it is,

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,680
but, but, I, I think that Suta, if I remember correctly the context, he was just, ah, just,

27
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,760
he wasn't dealing with these, on the subtle level, these things, he was just basically

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,720
saying that, whatever protusion conceives, things end up being differently, but you could

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,000
say, what I haven't had, but conceiving, in itself, basically, like, monoperas, it's

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,520
already, ah, well, it's already the form of distortion, no matter how subtle the conceiving

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:03,480
is, and that's exactly the point, you conceive, there you go, you have the matter, and then

32
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,240
you have the appeared, well, you have the appearance of the matter, that's what you have,

33
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,640
based on that, you can discern that that appearance, is obviously the appearance of that matter,

34
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,240
but even saying that that matter, that actually, it's part of that appearance, that designation,

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,280
so you can't go beyond the appearance, or, or science, like, look sideways, and then

36
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,600
find that, which is the, the, the, the cause for that appearance, because it would, the only

37
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,560
way to know that there is matter behind appearance is, because of that, which appears, so the

38
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,320
matter can never be accessed directly, as appearance can, so you're going to have this appearance,

39
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,040
well, whatever you think about matter, and that's the thing, that's monoperas, so basically,

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,600
it's that appearance, that you then conceive to be that matter, you conceive it to be in

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,040
that matter, you conceive it to be out of that matter, you, in other words, you conceive

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,040
the matter, through not understanding appearance, see, the fact that, like, if you, if you were to,

43
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,640
if you were to, if you were to assume that this appearance is in the matter, you fail to

44
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,520
see that that thought in the matter is already part of that appearance, but no, you, you don't,

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,120
you don't take it like that, you take it to stand for that, which that matter is, because

46
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:33,960
of which this appearance is, so many to replay this, and it's your time, but basically,

47
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:42,440
it's, it's quite essential, or you conceive to be out, or in and out, or both, or to be

48
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,760
mine, or whatever, whatever permutation you can do, any of those things, it's irrelevant

49
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,040
whether you conceive it in or out, to be mine, to be for me, to be I am, the point is,

50
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,600
you're conceiving relationship, and if you're conceiving relationship, you are putting

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,520
the appearance, and the matter, because of which appearance is, you are putting them on

52
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,040
the same footing, you, you, by comparing them, by relating them, not necessarily comparing

53
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:20,360
them, but by relating them, you are basically conceiving the matter, because even that thought

54
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,280
of, oh, this is from the matter, it's apart from the matter, it's in the matter, it's

55
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,800
out of the matter, it's because of the matter, that thought of that matter, it's part of

56
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,480
that appearance, but you take it to stand for the matter because of which appearance is,

57
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,440
because you conceiving, you gave it life that it doesn't actually have, you gave it being

58
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:57,040
that it doesn't have, thus you made it exist, just through that, but if you thoroughly understand

59
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:06,240
appearance, as again, the illustration I gave of the mirror in front of you, and the thing

60
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,200
that appears is behind you, it's obviously not perfect, because in the long as a sumic

61
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,400
you can just turn your head, but you can't, in this case you can't turn your head or look

62
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,400
somewhere where you will access that matter, because all you can ever access will be the

63
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,240
appearance, because that's what appears, that's what accessing is, which, which that means

64
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,800
that this matter is always below your feet, always, and fully discerning that will make you

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,200
then completely relinquish any notion of belonging in regards to anything that appears,

66
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,560
and what do you pick, everything appears, five only it's appeared, the nature is to appear,

67
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,480
disappear and persist or change, so you abandon the whole thing, through seeing that it's

68
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,400
fully undermined by the four great elements, for example, in this example, and they can

69
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,240
never, you can never access the four great elements, yet your entire life, your entire existence

70
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,480
is big, it's like directly found in the pond and even you think, oh I can't access the

71
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,640
four great elements, you can be conceiving the four great elements, if you think that

72
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,720
thought stands for that which four great elements is, but it can't stand because that thought

73
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,640
has appeared, thus it's part of the appearance, but the discernment can pertain, the knowledge

74
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,720
can be directed towards that which does not appear, but it's the ultimate determination

75
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,280
of your entire experience as a whole, so you can discern, and that's just basically

76
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,160
changing the direction, so you never arrive at that because of which this appearance is,

77
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,400
because that will make it appear, but you just change the direction, instead of for me

78
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:46,280
it's opposite, it's not for me, it comes from elsewhere, and that's enough for dispassion,

79
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:56,320
so any appearance, any experience, yeah it's not for me, so it's the opposite or for me

80
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,640
like towards you, it's the rises for you, whether it take you to leave it, it's up to you

81
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,680
but it's for you, my eyes, my sights, it's all for me, it's mine, well now you take

82
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,360
it completely against that direction, you go the other way, it's not for you, it arises

83
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,800
from that which you cannot even conceive in your thoughts, you can't think of it, but

84
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,920
it is that because of which, and see even when I'm talking about it like this, that's

85
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:27,440
obviously the limits of the designation, you are talking about it, like you know, like

86
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,040
I said, oh it's inexpressible, but I just expressed it, and this is the nature of designation,

87
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,640
so you should not mystify that because of which your appearance is, you should discern

88
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:46,200
it, and the Buddha said, when the four great elements change, and the four great elements

89
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:54,680
they find the footing in your experience through your concealings, through the consciousness

90
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,840
because if I think about earth, yes, that's all you can do about it, but by recognizing

91
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,400
that the appearance is all you have, it will make you stop assuming that you can actually

92
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,440
access the great elements, or access anything so to speak, you can't even access the five

93
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,720
other gates because if you were able to access them in that sense, you would be their owner,

94
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,800
but you are not, you can't be, so you're just constantly maintaining that assumption

95
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,240
that basically feeds the conceivings, and it's because of the conceivings, you just maintain

96
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,840
the vicious circle that's completely different, actually, it's unnecessary in any shape form.

97
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,800
So the recognition of the five other gates, as being inaccessible to you, means okay,

98
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,160
you change the direction, they're not for you anymore because you can't, you can't uphold

99
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,080
them, you can't, you're not in their control, and they're not in your control because they

100
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:58,400
are determined by that, which you can't even think, let alone see, taste, the touch,

101
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,200
completely behind you, completely underneath, below your feet, you are the reason for, you

102
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,000
are sorry, you are the result, the result of them, yeah, you can say that, you're the

103
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,560
simultaneous presence, your whole life, the simultaneous presence of that means these

104
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,280
things are present because I'm still alive, because my aggregates are still there, means

105
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,640
the elements are still there, the consciousness in regard to them is still there, but all

106
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,840
of that is indirect to you, what you have direct in front of you is Nama in regard to

107
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:37,160
Lupa, and that's it, and what about the famous, this body and name and form externally,

108
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,640
the around experiences, yeah, that's slightly, slightly different, different approach from

109
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:51,520
this, but if you were to remove all the assumptions, all the conceivings, and you recognize that

110
00:10:51,520 --> 00:11:00,000
this very body, that you, well, the appearance of this very body is comprised of those four

111
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,560
great elements, and the four great elements can be discerned in regard to that appearance,

112
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,080
and that's absolutely fine, as long as you don't start, well, there wouldn't be a discernment,

113
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,920
basically, as long as you don't start then regarding the discernment, as that, those elements

114
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,720
because of which this body is, because the discernment of the elements, the four great elements,

115
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,040
and the appearance of the body as a result of the four great elements, they're both appearance,

116
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,080
they're on the level of appearance, they share the nature of appearance, they're on different

117
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,760
level of generality, obviously, the body is particular manifestation, the four great elements

118
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,960
and notions of four great elements, but they can accurately stand for the four great elements

119
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,400
if you don't conceive four great elements through those notions, that was in relation

120
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,520
to the other talk we spoke recently about the abstraction, when things cease to be abstract,

121
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,720
they stand for that which they are, and your thought will stand for that element, will

122
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,280
be an accurate representation, because that's all it can be, a representation of four great

123
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:03,040
elements of a great element, when it doesn't conceal the element through that, so for an

124
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,400
argument with three from conceivings, all that is left is this conscious body here, this

125
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,760
matter paired with consciousness externally, and all the name and forms externally, all

126
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,520
the things that arise, name and form, basically all of the appearance externally, in other

127
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,320
words, the direction of internal mind towards me has changed and now it's all external,

128
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,720
even your utmost personal thoughts, it's just the external appearance, this conscious

129
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,600
point, means basically the arrangement of the consciousness and the elements, it's still

130
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,840
operating, the arrangement that you can't just, you can't even conceive anymore, on a higher

131
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:52,080
structure, well not on a higher or on a probably more, on a deeper, below your feet, on

132
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,000
your ground, underneath your ground, well in a way it's more general, but no more general

133
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:09,040
to pertain to things that would appear more generally, it's more immediate, and the way

134
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,320
it appears, this conscious body, when it appears as a thought, that thought doesn't conceive

135
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,520
it to be, that conscious body to be in, that conscious body, from the conscious body,

136
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,040
apart from or for me or mine, it doesn't conceive, it doesn't conceive, you just have a thought

137
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,800
as a mirror representation of the conscious body present, because of which you can still

138
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,160
descend to the conscious body's present day, because of conscious body still present day,

139
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:40,240
and all of the appearance in regard to it, that's external to you, well not even to you

140
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,000
anymore, because that would imply a certain relationship, all this external to me which

141
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,680
could imply internal, no it's just external, internal becomes external, just less external

142
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:57,800
than external external, because internal is usually mine, dear, appropriated, so that

143
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,600
internal dimension of putugina stays, it's just not seen as external, and think that

144
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:26,320
we're external, we're seen as externally external, because we're talking about today

145
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,080
about putting the structure, by the existence, into the right order, so we're talking

146
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,640
when the structure is in the right order, the structure is in the structure, you just

147
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,400
stop conceiving the wrong order, over on top of the existing order of the structure,

148
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,920
and that's doing the same, that's what, well yeah in a way that means not conceiving basically,

149
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,160
because the order of things, yeah, well let's put aside the four great elements, because

150
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:07,680
that might be the subtle, but back onto the conscious body, right here, the senses, so

151
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,600
you can, as I was telling you today, you can actually touch your eyeball, yeah, close

152
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,520
your eyelids, and you can feel the shape, you can feel everything, and it is that flesh

153
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,800
that you're touching, that bowl, that you're touching, with your fingers, that is that

154
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:36,720
because of which, there is a whole life of vision, of sights, things you see, desired

155
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,600
and lost in regard to them, fear in regard to things you see, grief in regard to things

156
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,240
you see, anything basically, the whole world in regard to things you see, and same goes

157
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:55,440
for every sense, yet if you were to touch an apple that had to torch your eyeball, it's

158
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,480
all, it's all shares in nature, it's all material, but it's this particular matter that

159
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,800
pertains to your body, then it's also paired with consciousness, and obviously you can't

160
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,640
see that consciousness, it's just the fact that you can discern that it's paired with

161
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,040
consciousness because you see as a result of that flesh yeah, you don't see as a result

162
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,960
of an apple or a cup or a table, you see as a result of this eye, so that's the only

163
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:28,760
difference, is the particular arrangement of that matter enables you to see the forms

164
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,720
because the consciousness is there with it, but you, there is no further, like you can't

165
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,000
take this to further to greater analysis to explain because as I said consciousness

166
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,840
doesn't appear, so you can talk about it but most likely you end up conceiving it, you

167
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:51,200
end up giving it that which doesn't have, but what you can do is recognize that it's

168
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,280
only the passion in regard to eye and forms, lastly in regard to eye and forms, heal well

169
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,240
in regard to eye and forms, delusion in regard, that's only matters, so you have to do,

170
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,600
it's fine with regard, you stop giving possibility for last to arise in regard to eye and forms,

171
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,720
and that's it, when the last is removed then that's all it needs to be done, then what

172
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,720
is left is this conscious body, this fleshy eye, this fleshy nose, this fleshy tongue, there

173
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,240
is still out there below my feet with consciousness, and I know that because things still appear

174
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:52,560
for me, thus when those aggregates break apart that's it,

175
00:17:52,560 --> 00:18:05,080
to be mindful of the, that which doesn't appear yet is the basis of your appearance, well

176
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,600
no you couldn't be mindful of that which doesn't appear, you can be mindful of the appearance

177
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,720
in regard to that because of which appearance is, and the more accurately mindful you are,

178
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:24,200
as conceiving as a present, but that which doesn't appear, well you just made it appear

179
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,600
through the statement, it is that which doesn't appear, and that's fine, you can't have

180
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,160
a state, you can't have a designation, you can't have Nama in regard to root by C conceivable,

181
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:43,160
and that's for people expect to access Rupa, or they assume that they have access to Rupa,

182
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,640
and then my Nama is kind of optional, no it's not, Nama Rupa, Rupa is revealed through

183
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,240
the designation of Nama, that's why it's inseparable, Nama Rupa, so that revelation

184
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:04,360
is very inaccurate, it's conceived, so all you have to do is sort of make it accurate,

185
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,840
stop conceiving it, purified, but only when I have the Nama Rupa, as the way I said,

186
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,960
this conscious body, a name and form externally, that's what's left for the Nama, so even

187
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,400
other end doesn't remove name in regard to form, or doesn't access form in the name forms

188
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:29,880
of, it's name and form, it's just discerning properly, through that name, you can then remove

189
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:40,600
the footing for the form in terms of conceivable, so you can liberate yourself, so mindfulness

190
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,440
in the, let's say mindfulness of the body, and when you think, when you have a thought

191
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,280
of mindfulness of the body, you're not actually directly mindful of those four great elements,

192
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,280
because you can access them, if you're mindful of their appearance, or rather you're mindful

193
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,680
of appearance, because that's what appearance is, it's not their appearance, the appearance

194
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,120
is, and the appearance is because the four great elements are still there standing,

195
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,280
is that the body that should be noticed in the sake of the time now, that's, which,

196
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
what do you mean that?

197
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,720
Well, that's what you've got to understand, that's what, that's what the body that you

198
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,120
want to see, we might love it, is the body that appeared, if you're properly mindful,

199
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,280
you'll, you'll, you'll understand mindfulness, you'll understand appearance, you would stop

200
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:33,440
conceiving, but if you, even through a practice of mindfulness, still think that this is that

201
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,520
the body, no, it's comprised of the four great elements, means the appearance, it's made

202
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,560
of it, but that's all you have, but the mindfulness, if you start being mindful correctly, it's

203
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:50,640
not mine, not for me, not I am, because that's it, as I said, you come to mindful of the actual

204
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,760
elements behind the body, or underneath it, but you can disown the body, which then will

205
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,200
become an accurate representation of the four great elements, and their ultimate nature

206
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,680
is, they're not yours, they cannot be yours, they're not even possible to be yours, so

207
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,120
you start emulating that in regard to appearance, and eventually it will, it will stand for, for

208
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,200
how things actually are, which means you've been around, then you can't undo it, so as

209
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,800
proper mindfulness has to be paired with that knowledge, absolutely, right view comes

210
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,320
first, even the mindful, this cannot be the right one, there's no right view, no matter

211
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:39,880
how general that mindfulness is, the right view always comes first, which is why any

212
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:58,000
makes everything else right, then upon it, it's like this in the Anapanasati Sutra, there's

213
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,820
one section in the beginning, it's always translated, calming the bodily formation, what is the

214
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:19,920
bodily formation, the breath, breathing, Anapanasati Sutra, Kainasankara, here, while breathing

215
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,280
in the experiences, the whole body, or the whole breath, there are people that have the

216
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,720
breath of the body, but the experiences while breathing, the whole body, and then the

217
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:39,000
next sentence says, while breathing, you have to, he breathes calming, the body formation,

218
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:50,000
now if the body formation is breathing, he could have said calming the breath, well, he

219
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,400
could have said that, but then he wouldn't be seen as Sankara, he wouldn't serve for

220
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,680
a student, recognition and cultivation of the simultaneous principle of Sankara and Sankara

221
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,640
to them, and that's the whole point, full understanding of the principle means our

222
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,160
energy, but if he just says, he just can't be breath, you won't be seen, but he depended

223
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:20,360
upon the action of breathing, that's the point, the point, you take on mindfully an act

224
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:28,920
of breathing, in the same sense, the will turn, turns the will like this, turns the will

225
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,800
like that, you breathe in like this, you breathe, it's not that you're trying to control it,

226
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:41,220
in terms of stock it, or force it, the breathing is there, but you kind of, like, imagine

227
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,840
the horses that are already running, but then you join in and you take the reins, but

228
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,960
you don't interfere with the running, but you do take the reins, and you might slow it

229
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,880
down or something, but there's still going the direction and you're not changing that,

230
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,320
so you take on the mindfully an act of breathing, and then you can influence through the existing

231
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,680
act of breathing, you can okay, along the breath, short and the breath, the point is you're

232
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:10,400
mindful of the breathing, that experience being mindful of the breathing, because breathing

233
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,800
is bodily, it's bound with a body, it's inseparable, it's inconceivable, so even just the thought

234
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,120
of breathing already implies the experience of the body, it's in there, so when you're

235
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,000
thinking about breathing, when you're breathing, through that you're already imploring a form

236
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,560
of experience of the body, and that experience of the body is determined by your active engagement

237
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,080
in breathing, so your record is, because the breathing of the body is there, and obviously

238
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,240
the body is bound with a breathing, doesn't mean that, doesn't necessarily mean cause

239
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,080
an effect, breathing results in body, that means they're inseparable, that's it, that's

240
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,160
the problem, they always occur together, never apart, inconceivable to have them apart,

241
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:57,200
you can't concede the breathing without a body, inclined in that act, you just can't be,

242
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,400
no matter, even if it's the utmost abstraction, if you think breathing, it implies the body,

243
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:10,880
thus it's a body, it's a body, it's a body, it's bound up with a body, so then you recognize

244
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,080
okay, because this is inseparable from, this experience of the body right here, now separate

245
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,720
from breathing, you don't have to think about your active breathing, but this body here,

246
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,240
it's that body that is inseparable from breathing, so only form of experience of the body, it

247
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:35,440
will be the body that implies breathing, inasmuch breathing implies the body, so then through

248
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:46,040
calming down the mindful act of breathing, oh no, because that body, that abstract body,

249
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,240
you can say even like that, that is implied in my thought of breathing, that abstract

250
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,760
body is this body right here right there, and that relationship is external, but that

251
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,880
body that you think of, when you look through the act of breathing, is that body right here

252
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:11,200
right now, so then through affecting, through calming down the active breathing, calming down

253
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,720
those thoughts in regard to the active breathing, actually you are pretending you are gradually

254
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,440
affecting the body right here right now, because that relationship is external, the thoughts

255
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,480
that you had in regard to breathing and the body that's assumed in that breathing, you're

256
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,360
learning your head, that thought is the appearance of the thing, and that thought, that thought

257
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,480
that has the tacit implication of a body in regard to breathing, that body there is

258
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,880
the body that's right here right now, so when you think breathing and that abstract

259
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,400
body that appears, that body is the body that you can access through your body, unless

260
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,960
it's the thoughts of breathing, and that's it, it's this conscious body and name and form

261
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,040
externally, the thoughts of breathing are the name and forms externally that imply that

262
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:14,080
body, this conscious body right here right now, so instead of maintaining the connection

263
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,600
of my body, my thoughts, you actually pull it out and you recognize no, it's the conscious

264
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,840
body right here right now, and when I think about it, that's also external in regard to

265
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,920
the conscious body, there is no internal dimension that it's mind, so through cultivating the

266
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,920
act of breathing, the thoughts of breathing, the mindfully subreading, you start discerning

267
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,000
a phenomenon of body within that act of breathing, there is actually this body right here right

268
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,640
now, just seen from a different view at the same time, the body that appears, yeah, well

269
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,440
don't, yeah, don't worry, that's a different approach, don't try and mix it, the elements

270
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,360
and that, because of which it appears, but yeah, if you start seeing it at the same time,

271
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,760
if a thing is present wise or if it's seen at the same time from two points of view, so

272
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,920
to speak, none of them can be yours, because mind, me, I am, requires that singularity,

273
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,200
I look from here to there, but now you recognize a thing is present, I'm seen from there, and

274
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:25,200
experience right here at the same time, which one is yours, well you recognize none of them

275
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:40,560
can be yours, so put your attention and experience of the body right here right now, and

276
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:46,520
then start breathing, and through that breathing, discern the body, that then you study basically

277
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:57,000
this discerning as, oh, the body that I'm discerning through my breathing actually stands for

278
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,000
this very body that I'm experiencing right here right now, but the relationship is external.

279
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:22,840
And then you can spread it, a thought of the body, that's all the name Rupa, that then

280
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,560
you just conceived to be off, this is this body right here right now, through that internal

281
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
connection.

282
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,960
Oh, my thought is this body comes from this body, it's this body, in the body, out of the

283
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:43,400
body, from the body, it's for me, it's my, but when you recognize the thought of the body,

284
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:59,440
as in the reason phenomenon externally, and then see it standing for that body out there,

285
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:12,360
yeah, out there right here, for that flesh eye, for that nose, for the tongue, again, flesh

286
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:18,640
eye, it's a designation, it's an appearance, that stands for the flesh eye, but you assume

287
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,200
oh, it's my flesh eye, but if you see that that flesh eye will not be known if there is

288
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,040
no external appearance of a thought flesh eye, phenomenon without it, it's just inconceivable,

289
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,520
inseparable from you, then it can't be yours, then it just becomes all external, oh, it's

290
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:45,680
all out there, just there, right here, or younger, or whatever, none of it is mine.

291
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,200
Because that's the thing, you don't need to keep constantly attending to this body right

292
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,600
here right now, because this body is right here right now, and you're not sure about it.

293
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:02,280
All you want to do is stop misconceiving it, or misconceiving things that appear in regard

294
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,080
to this body right here right now.

295
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,240
So mindfulness of breathing, through actively engaging in active breathing, you start discerning

296
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,400
the body, the phenomenon of body, which you can, oh, this is my body, this is the same

297
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,640
as this body, this is the body, all you just are seeing this body is basically that's

298
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,240
the representation that we spoke earlier of the body present right here right now.

299
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,120
So there's one way I'm looking at it, all you can then just be mindful of the erison

300
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:39,040
body, conscious body right here right now.

301
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,040
You can't really imagine it, because if you would imagine it accurately, it wouldn't

302
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,200
be imagination, it would stand for how things are.

303
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,400
The generalizes is seen from two points of view, always, you can't just have one point

304
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:07,240
of view, inconsiderable, so it's always present, vice, simultaneous, not vice, there will be

305
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
one too.

306
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:31,080
Here's a present, it's double, explain that, yeah, I can try it, but I can see that everything

307
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
is seen from two different points of view.

308
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:42,400
Like everything other it is, it arises, there are two points of view to every experience,

309
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,840
simultaneous present, which is why you can then develop the assumption of one point of

310
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:59,680
view, which is me.

311
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:05,400
If you were to see that you're the center of your sense of self, it's always determined

312
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,000
by something else different than the sense of self, it's two things of present, the

313
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,280
center of the sense of self, and that which is there with you.

314
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,640
At the same time, it's simultaneously present, a colleague, that's what it means, not

315
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:29,480
pertain to time, it's simultaneous, there is no time in between.

316
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,560
So if whichever point of view you took to be used, within that you discern, there is determined

317
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,160
by that which you didn't take to be used.

318
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,880
If you take that to be used, you discern, there is some, basically, no matter what point

319
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,920
of view you take to be used, simultaneously it's determined by that which cannot be used

320
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,520
at the same time, because you can't have both things at the same time, because I would

321
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,240
require a third point of view, that's more general to these two point of view, but that's

322
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,240
inconceivable.

323
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,720
So you can't help but have a point of view, well sorry, you can't help but attend one

324
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,040
point of view, but through that you discern another direction, that it's not the same direction,

325
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,880
that it determines this direction.

326
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,840
So there is a direction of the conscious body, and there is a direction of the name and

327
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:22,880
form externally, and you can discern, both of them simultaneously present, obviously,

328
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,240
you have to be attending one point of view together, if you attend conscious body, you'll be

329
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,760
discerning the form externally, if you attend the form externally, you'll be discerning conscious

330
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,240
body through that.

331
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,040
But if that's all you can ever have, if you contemplate that long enough, you'll stop

332
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,360
assuming one single unifying point of view, that it's neither here nor there, no box

333
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,840
nor whatever, because that's only maintained through a simple knot, not discernment of

334
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,440
the arrangement of things, basically by knot, fully understanding that things cannot

335
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,640
be yours, you may attend the ocean of their mind.

336
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,440
So right here right now, while you're thinking about what I've just said, your body is seated

337
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,440
present with the conscious and spared with it, there's two same thing as things.

338
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:19,840
And no matter how hard you're thinking, whatever you're thinking, through that, the discernment

339
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,960
of this conscious body present right here right now is possible, because this conscious

340
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,040
body right here right now is there, and in this particular instance, it's basically the

341
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,640
reason why you're able to think in the first place.

342
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:42,320
That's why any dama can also be a sancar, any of the aggregates can also be a determination

343
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,200
because they're watching the breath.

344
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,040
It depends what you attend, then the opposite, if the discern the opposite of where your

345
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
attention is.

346
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,480
So if I'm watching the body, if you're watching the body, I can see that it's been

347
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:02,640
termination as the breath, but I'm not looking at the breath directly, I guess, so yeah,

348
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,720
I can see it in the background just there, or if I'm looking at the breath, I can see

349
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
the body.

350
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:19,320
The practice is on the panasati, but just in terms of that practice, watching the breath

351
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
and having the body.

352
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,280
Well, in terms of that practice, yeah, you want to be doing the manifest of breathing.

353
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:35,800
You want to be actively, because it's a form of enact, you want to tune yourself into

354
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:42,600
the new breathing, and you recognize through this very act, you start discerning the implicit

355
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:49,160
notion of the body, present, right there, right there, inseparable from.

356
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,560
If something were to happen, while you're breathing there and discerning the body through

357
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:04,800
the body, if those elements that the body is comprised of would change, disappear, be

358
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:13,160
affected by some other external factor.

359
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,560
You realize that the whole act that you're still mindful of engaging with breathing cannot

360
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:27,120
remain standing, yet its foundations are completely inaccessible to you.

361
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
You can't happen.

362
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,600
If something happens to the elements, you can't possibly continue breathing.

363
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,480
You can't possibly continue discerning the body through that.

364
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,840
So through contemplating like that, you have abandoned the very nature of action, of intentional

365
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,160
action that you're breathing.

366
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,400
It's an act, it's a neutral act, which is what it will praise it.

367
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
So you can't even do that long enough.

368
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,720
You develop mindfulness that then won't be disturbed by any other form of act that

369
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,560
the notion holds, obviously that, to be abandoned beforehand.

370
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,920
So when you're sitting, walking, eating, talking, none of that then becomes, none of that continues

371
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:19,000
to imply, well, the notion of permanence, the notion of controlling, regard to things.

372
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,600
So you abandon your own intention, ceases to be yours, because through practicing of intentional

373
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,920
ascending to breathing, and breathing in like this, breathing out like that, discerning

374
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,560
the body through that, and then seeing that if that thing changes, if that determination

375
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,960
is swept away, none of your present acts can remain.

376
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,720
You do that long enough, none of the notions of I am, and this is me, this is for me, can

377
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,240
remain standing, it will just evaporate.

378
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:53,880
So you just breathe, and through breathing simultaneously, you discerning the presence

379
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,440
of the body.

380
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,760
Now you can start attending to the body right here right now, but then obviously you're

381
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,560
not mindful of the breathing anymore.

382
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
It's fine.

383
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,000
You can be mindful of the body, but then you're not doing an open sati, that's also fine.

384
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,680
And there's just one way of developing mindfulness.

385
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,920
But if you are a stickton of a sati, you just continue breathing, while you discerning

386
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,680
the body through that, and then it is all right, if I calm down, this breathing, this

387
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:25,120
active engagement, that body will calm down.

388
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:32,400
If I slow down the experience of that body through that slowing down and breath will be affected

389
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
as well.

390
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,440
And then you can contemplate the flow of the truth, or any other thing, as the Buddha says,

391
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,880
through that breathing.

392
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:50,000
So you have refined your active engagement with the action, with the nature of action.

393
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
So you're not distracted, you're doing it mindfully.

394
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,680
And through that you discerning the present, because no matter what you're doing, whether

395
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,440
you're sweeping leaves, walking, sitting, talking, there is an implication of your body

396
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,000
present right there, simultaneously.

397
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,840
Because if that body is not present right there, right then simultaneously, you wouldn't

398
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,360
be able to be engaging in these acts actively at the very time.

399
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:17,120
You're not aware of it, you're not aware of the presence of the body.

400
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:23,760
While you engage actively in this task, because your attention is mindful.

401
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,320
So then you maintain the notion of appropriation through that very thing.

402
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,840
But you start discerning the body, and then you recognize that, well, there is no room

403
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,000
for me and I am in the act.

404
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,960
Direct, this act, this intention, these choices are making, next moment, are all possible,

405
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:51,320
because there is the implication that you can see through of the body, right what those

406
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,240
acts are present.

407
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:01,880
So is that thought that is crystallizing, or that body that's revealed, through mindful

408
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,760
engagement with these acts, or the body is always present, there's a phenomenon of present

409
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,520
body through these acts, and that body is at which this body is, when I think about it,

410
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
separate it.

411
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,720
So either, whether you think about it directly or indirectly, you stop conceiving it as

412
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
yours.

413
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,440
You see there's that thing out there, because of which you're able to move an act and

414
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
choose.

415
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,960
And then you start seeing your own choices as a result, because of that present conscious

416
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,920
body out there and out there at the time.

417
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,600
So then next time you make a choice, or rather, when you practice it sufficiently, then when

418
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,280
the choices are being made, even that, the most personal thing I want this over there,

419
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,960
ceases to induce the notion of personality, because its understanding is seen through

420
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:54,320
it through, because would you be able to think, unrelated things to your body, just think

421
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:00,960
something completely out of the imagination, abstraction, can't you see?

422
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,560
Would that be possible, if the body is not present?

423
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,400
If the body, if the consciousness is not present, then living there.

424
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,800
So no matter how disconnected, unrelated your thoughts might be, the nature of the thought

425
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,320
is bound with the body.

426
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:24,440
Inasmuch, the body is bound with the mind, I, thoughts.

427
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,800
Hence it only depends what you attend, it will be determined by the other.

428
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,040
Because you wouldn't be able to even think about body, or talk about body.

429
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,000
If the mind doesn't designate you as a time as body, as that, as that physical in regard

430
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,520
to itself, or as that mental in regard to itself.

431
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,120
So to fully discern that, those thoughts in regard to body would stop conceiving, would

432
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,360
stop making you assume that that is actually that matter, no, it's still the thoughts.

433
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:01,920
So you can have your thoughts and thoughts, that's why the mind comes first.

434
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,520
Would you know a cup is a cup?

435
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:10,600
Would you know matter is matter, like even saying it matter, thinking it matter.

436
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,120
That's all a good designation, that's all you have.

437
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:19,680
Just designations are different levels of generality pertaining to different things, but still

438
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:34,560
designations.

439
00:43:34,560 --> 00:44:00,640
So what you really do is make sure that when it comes to the designation of the body,

440
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:08,080
in regards to body, whether peripherally, whether directly, when you're attending it,

441
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,400
you don't conceive that that is that matter, you don't conceive that that is what those

442
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:19,080
great elements are, because they will always remain below your feet, they will always remain

443
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:25,280
that because of which this appearance is, and this appearance in this case is the designation

444
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,440
of this body, right here right now that I'm seeing, I can touch parts of it, I can think

445
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,600
about it, that's all fine, that's the only thing you can have, even if you were to think

446
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:42,520
about it, just stop conceiving that to be standing for this external world of four great elements,

447
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:49,760
because that's another thought, so you have your thoughts in regards to thoughts, but those

448
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,160
thoughts can be discerned, oh they are because of the four great elements that I'm thinking

449
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,320
right here right now, which is all I can do, but I'm not conceiving to be those four great

450
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,400
elements, and that's the important thing, because if you only say, oh all you have is your

451
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,720
thoughts, then you fall into a very obvious naive form of ideal, whatever you think it's

452
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,080
in your head, well no, see, whatever I think it's in my head, you assume your head to be

453
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,400
materially in regard to your thoughts, but then even that is your thoughts, you can't even

454
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,000
in touch or be saying whatever you're thinking it's in my head, because that's in my head,

455
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,120
which is in my head, which is in my head, which is in my head, indefinitely, but if you

456
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:35,640
recognize the notion of my head, it's because it's underlined by the four great elements,

457
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,880
there are also another notion, but the notion does not conceive itself to be the actual

458
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,240
four great elements, or to be apart from them, which would imply them to be something else,

459
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,520
or to be in them, or to be from them, or to be for me, or to be mind.

460
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,480
The notion just doesn't conceive any of that, it's as the notion, it's known, and notion

461
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:07,360
is known as a notion, so it doesn't conceive that because of which the notion is, or put

462
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:14,160
it in more simple terms, the notion is fully disowned, the notion is disowned as impossible

463
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:21,200
to know, notion is a dharma, a dharma, notion is a phenomenon, notion of this, notion of

464
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,840
that, think, I thought you can call it whatever you want, basically a phenomenon, phenomenon

465
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,480
is that which has an age to appear, what has an age to appear, everything has an age

466
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,440
to appear that you can talk about, things that have no age to appear, you can't possibly

467
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,680
disown it, since they don't appear, you can't even think about it.

468
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:58,280
When you reach that understanding, abide in that understanding, yeah, become that understanding,

469
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:05,240
it would used to say about finding a balance in it, it's you, you can't find it.

470
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,240
When you need to balance it, once you understood, you can't undo the understanding, so there's

471
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:15,040
no balance to be maintained, because it's developed, and that's why you know it's developed

472
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,800
with vision that you see it, what you're talking about now, you see it, but then you

473
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,360
can, well you can know that it hasn't been developed sufficiently, it hasn't been developed

474
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:32,720
fully, and then you just have to keep repeating it and drilling it, they're very, same inside.

475
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:51,120
Find the best to get in there, those dummies, those, yeah, by understanding the dummies,

476
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:57,400
by understanding the, that which has an age to appear, which is your thoughts, your feelings,

477
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:08,920
your intentions, so perception has an age to appear, feeling has an age to appear, attention

478
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:19,120
has an age to appear, even your attention has an age to appear, because you can talk

479
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,040
well I'm attending to this, so it's indirect, it's negative in regard to what is being

480
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:34,400
attended, but it appears, has an attention, and so all of that is normal, the designation,

481
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:42,840
name, that's a Nama Rupa, Rupa, there you go, you just said it in the same sense, you

482
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:50,280
said in the same way you said Nama, so Rupa is also designation, but it's a more general

483
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:57,240
designation than the designation of Nama, more fundamental, directional, but it still

484
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,960
maintains actually to the nature of the designation, they then stops conceiving itself to be

485
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:13,840
that Rupa, Nama Rupa, that's all, what is all, it's Nama Rupa, that's all they can

486
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:23,800
appear, nothing else except Nama Rupa can appear, but it doesn't mean that Rupa is actually

487
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:37,400
the Rupa because of which Nama Rupa is as appearance, so there's only one way to correctly

488
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:46,480
accurately designate Rupa, and that way is by not having that designation stand for that

489
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,120
Rupa, if it doesn't, if it doesn't conceive that Rupa, the designation of Rupa doesn't

490
00:49:53,120 --> 00:50:01,840
conceive Rupa, that's the only accurate designation, and that's the liberation, you practice

491
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:08,440
that, and it will be free from all conceivants, from all implications of my, thus from all

492
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:25,080
implications of I am, thus from all implications of self, myself, and personality, or you can

493
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:32,080
take your experience as a whole, and regard, and you have kind of things aspects of it

494
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,600
in a more mental, and aspects of it in a more material, so to speak, but both are actually

495
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:44,240
part of the designation, Nama in regard to Rupa, so what you have to do is, while they

496
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,600
are simultaneously present, well stop regarding the material aspect, as, stop assuming the

497
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,080
material aspect, as pertaining to the actual method, because of which the designation of material

498
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:09,320
aspects can, can arise, stop conceiving them, because any movement of your mind, it's

499
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:19,720
already pertaining to the, it appears, thus it's part of Nama in regard to Rupa, so you

500
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:27,560
can know your experience as a whole, and whatever shape and form can arise, it's because of

501
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:34,360
the four great elements, as long as that knowledge, well then you won't be a knowledge, but

502
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,360
as long as that thought, does not conceal the four great elements, through the thought

503
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,520
about them, you don't actually assume that that's what they are, or that there's something

504
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,120
else, or elsewhere, or both, or neither, you just don't give into any of those, you just

505
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:56,400
have a thought of four great elements, so you don't overdo it, you don't underdo it,

506
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,640
and then that thought won't be conceiving them, they won't find footing in your experience,

507
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,760
which means your experience will be free, and that's just something that needs to be repeated

508
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,160
on and on, not through different means, but you end up repeating the same principle,

509
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:28,160
by all the other things, it's a hard call of contemplation, it's a bit of a head spin-off,

510
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:37,440
well it's a head spin-off, obviously you will not be as particular as that, but you

511
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,800
don't have to, because they are much less particular things, sorry, much less ambiguous

512
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,960
things that you can contemplate, there would be maintaining and obviously drilling the

513
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:58,840
same principle, no mind, not for me, not for my control, if you extend that principle

514
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,800
to the point of pertaining to the thought of not mine, not for me, not my control, then

515
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,120
you won't leave anything excluded, and if you repeat that long enough, then that will

516
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,440
become apparent, because it does correspond with how things actually are, not yours, not

517
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:22,040
for you, not in your control, how do you call it, okay, that's the Mola Parianas

518
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:38,040
so it did amongst the not-the rejoicing world, because they didn't understand it, right,

519
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:47,880
for example, there's elements we're talking about today as well, essential pleasure, essential

520
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:56,760
pleasure element, and renunciation element, doubt, yeah, and your will element, not your

521
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:10,400
will element, cruelty element, not cruelty element, so when one is experiencing your will,

522
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:19,480
your will is the greater, and seeing those two things, why is it, then I'll go greater,

523
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:36,280
why is it more, why is it greater, why is it greater, but it takes, it doesn't take

524
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:46,200
you, no, that's why it holds them, but why is it greater, why is it structurally greater,

525
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:57,000
then your will, why is your will lower, then your will, because your will is determined,

526
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,400
no, it's because your will can only rise in regard to particular things, yes, that's

527
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,200
what I was trying, actually, yeah, it only, so if you experience your will, it's going

528
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,720
to be in regard to something, even if it's a very general ambiguous mood of thought, you're

529
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:20,240
having your will in regard to that, which means your will is always circumstantial, because

530
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:26,960
these things could have not or risen, so which is more, things that, sorry, no more, which

531
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,920
is more, oh yeah, no, can you have, can you have desired a last or your will in regard

532
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,720
to things that you've never seen, you've never heard, you've never thought of, you can't,

533
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:40,480
you can't have, you just see it's inconceivable to experience these other last or a version

534
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,280
in regard to that which is never, has never manifested in any particular form, you can't

535
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:52,560
have those, those things, you can only have non-real will, you can only have non-aversion,

536
00:55:52,560 --> 00:56:01,360
non-last, that's the default mood, on the basis of non-last, you develop last in regard

537
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,320
to something that's being manifested, but if you know that I can't have lost in regard

538
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,920
to things that are not manifested, that means that whatever is manifested, it's circumstantial,

539
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:17,800
because if it was manifested and hasn't been manifested before, if it was manifested

540
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:23,400
means, it could have not been manifested, and it certainly means, oh, it's manifested,

541
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:30,800
does, it would unmanifest, it will cease because it has a reason, you can't possibly have

542
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,720
lost for that which does manifest, you can't possibly have well for that which does manifest,

543
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,520
so then when you do have last or your will, you recognize, oh, it's in regard to a circumstantial

544
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:50,920
thing that could have not been, does it completely treat us, does, it's unnecessary, does it's impossible,

545
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:57,400
because last would actually imply that whole notion of, oh, this is special, this particular,

546
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,360
this is worth, this is valuable, this is great, but when you recognize that it's circumstantial,

547
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:07,160
it, it, it, it, it, it, while it loses its elevators, this is important, yeah, that's

548
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:17,160
what it means by saying, non-nil will is greater, it's more fundamental, it's more important,

549
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:24,720
why, because there are more things that happen in a reason, there are more things that are

550
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,280
manifested, and for them we should, for them we can't have lost, we can't have a little

551
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,760
ago which means, there is more non-nil will, even for people who are always angry, they're

552
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,920
always angry, that's a particular, which means on the general level, there is more non-nil

553
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:44,680
will, so that's why you don't do the non-nil will, you just discern it, and because of that

554
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:52,080
you can't engage in a will, and same, you discern the absence of passion as an inherent

555
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,720
characteristics of the five aggregates, and because of that you stop at the 10 notions

556
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:03,760
of passion in regard to the five aggregates, who pedan is not the five aggregates, he can't

557
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:10,600
possibly be, but it's not found anywhere else apart from that, is the designer last in regard

558
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:25,240
to five aggregates, the idea assumption is there, the non-design, non-last, or the five

559
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:31,680
aggregates, it's greater than particular manifestation of desire in regard to the particular

560
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,320
manifestation of the five aggregates, it's always essential, it always could have not

561
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,800
been, and that's another of the manipulations before, you start thinking that over the things

562
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:50,280
that are appearing, oh this could have not been, and this it will not be for me, so this

563
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:55,920
could have not been, the things that will be will not be for me, because that circumstantial

564
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:02,800
mess of it, the thread of it just pertains to the past, to the present, and the past that

565
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,080
is present, and the future that is present as a possibility, oh so when the things in the

566
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:12,600
future, if this ball is still remains standing in your eyes, it's impossible for them to

567
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:19,120
arrive for me, as much as this present thing is also impossible to be accepted by me,

568
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,000
it's impossible to be for me, that's your real is always, my whole past was actually

569
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:31,760
never for me, and that's who it was never mine, so that's how you don't dwell in the past,

570
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,960
and you don't go in the future, by discerning the present, by discerning them through the

571
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:44,440
present, not by stopping your thinking and the refraining from thinking about your past.

572
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:57,560
But by fully discerning that if thing is inaccessible now, their nature pertains in the future,

573
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:03,760
and their nature pervades the past, so that's why Arunhand does not like, you know, he was

574
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,480
in Arun always, but when he becomes in Arun, he doesn't have thoughts anymore, I was in

575
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:13,720
the past, now I'm in Arunhand, but I was in the past before, I actually was, as a person,

576
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:20,440
that whole thing is affected, why? because your present, any future, sorry, your past and

577
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:26,520
your future are both present, so either have present towards possibility, present future,

578
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,040
when you have all you have the overdetermined present which is your past, obviously you

579
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:36,120
don't have always laid in front of you past, present, future, because they will require

580
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:40,640
an entity, a subject that kind of has an overview of these three things, they're the flowing

581
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:48,320
in front of your eyes as a slideshow or something, you are part of that, which means you can

582
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:57,200
only have overdetermined present, that is present, or underdetermined present, that is present,

583
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,680
in other words you can have past that is present, if that's the direction you're looking,

584
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,840
or if you look in direction possibilities, you can have the future that's not yet present

585
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:12,160
and that's present, so it's a bit more complex, complex, for people who commonly think

586
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,720
it, I don't think about the future, don't go into the past, well no, that's present and

587
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:25,400
you have no choice about that present, don't regard your past as yours, don't plan

588
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,240
your future as belonging to you, as belonging to you, as arising for you, and there's no

589
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:42,640
problem, you think the future you want, it might not be, sorry, it will not be, it will

590
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:50,840
not be for me, and certainly it could have not been, whatever it is, it could have been

591
01:01:50,840 --> 01:02:04,280
not, circumstantial, circumstantial, so if you make any choices, any decisions, commit

592
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:11,400
any act, based on that which is circumstantial, you can only regard those choices, those

593
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:17,720
acts as yours, if you forget, or if you don't fully discern, the dependence of your choices

594
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:24,080
upon this circumstantially, a reason thing, if you remain mindful of the circumstantial nature

595
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,800
of the reason thing upon which you're acting and choosing and deciding, you won't be

596
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:35,480
only your choice either, but that can be only abandoned present, you can't go in hindsight

597
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:40,240
and say, ah well because things are not mine, my decisions are not mine as well, well that's

598
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:47,680
wishful thinking, you have to see that directly, while things are seen as ideas, why you decide

599
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:53,680
upon that, will not be yours, and then limits the things you can decide, because if you do

600
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,520
see circumstantial, a reason thing as the present, simultaneously present the terminations

601
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,400
of your choices in regard to the circumstantial thing, your choices cannot be infected by

602
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:22,680
the last version of delusion, it's impossible, because last version of delusion requires the

603
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:32,840
opposite of circumstantial, it requires the special, the important to the mind, but you see

604
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:38,840
that it can't be yours, it's not special, it's particularly a reason, but I can't

605
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,880
have the basis of all of it, it's not a reason, and you can't last the words it, and you

606
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:52,200
certainly can't have a little to the words it, and you won't be the living in regard to it,

607
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:57,240
it's just not worthy anymore, exactly, and that's what we're going to say, this is not worthy

608
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:23,200
of delight, of craving, it's not worthy, and you automatically stop doing it, even the

609
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:35,920
grief that arises through abandoning this, it's in this realm, again, the grief that

610
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:41,800
happens, it's within that, even that is circumstantial, so you surmount that, you're surmounting

611
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:51,160
grief as well, because grief is grief only when it's mind, but you stop grieving when it

612
01:04:51,160 --> 01:05:09,840
doesn't pertain to you anymore, it's up when if you are renouncing sensual pleasures

613
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:24,760
actually bring you strength, you're emulating the right order of thinking, but you also

614
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,360
know no matter what happens, because of your renouncing, because of your not engaging

615
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:36,440
sensual pleasures, it can't be a good thing, and it's, yeah, that's what we're going

616
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,760
to say, even if a person doesn't develop any wisdom, even if a monk doesn't develop

617
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:48,480
any wisdom, stays a protusion basically, and lives his whole life, his renunciation

618
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:55,120
life in tears, because of the pain of his renouncing, it's still better than giving

619
01:05:55,120 --> 01:06:04,720
him the sensuality, because at least he's living the principle, the principle of non-last,

620
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:10,600
because anyone can say anyone, he won't be enlightened as a result of it, but he certainly

621
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:16,480
by living the principle, he brings himself closer to enlightenment, obviously, in lives

622
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:23,120
to come, so it's still better in a long run, but when you have the knowledge, when you

623
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,640
have the knowledge, the sense, the principle that you start living beforehand, which is

624
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:35,560
why Celia has to come first, that the knowledge discerns, that's it, you discern, you

625
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:40,360
fully understood, now you don't even have to keep doing it, because you are it, you don't

626
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:45,240
have to keep emulating the principle, when you become a principle.

627
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,200
Yes, it takes over, yes, that's all, yes.

628
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:55,920
But always you can spend all emulating you want, now when it points out to you, if you

629
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,860
don't discern it, you won't, you will remain a Batujana, so that's why, there is no

630
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:08,560
dhamma without Celia, but certainly Celia is not dhamma, but the dhamma is impossible

631
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:16,120
to have without starting with emulation of the right principle, because dhamma is done

632
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:24,360
properly renunciation, can very easily be wisdom, with very little instruction, that's why

633
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:31,120
he sees the, he sees the danger in the slightest fault, doesn't mean he becomes neurotic, obsessed

634
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:37,120
with anxiety, he means he sees the danger, he starts discerning it, the slightest deviation

635
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:42,440
from the principle can be an obstacle, massive obstacle later on, it's a big danger,

636
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:57,360
so I won't deviate, it's like, you know, your ship is on a course, and you might move it

637
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:01,800
just like, I don't know, 0.01 degree, but then if that course goes long enough, that 0.01

638
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:23,520
can pose you to miss the whole continent, because eventually it will light up, so if

639
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:30,600
you literally, if you just start emulating the principle of non-last, non-aversion, non-delusion,

640
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:39,160
non-indolence, with your body, with your speech, with your mind, with little instruction from

641
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:45,320
the suitors, maybe more than enough, obviously, you need to emulate the principle harder, with

642
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:51,120
more discerning, disdestruction, you can emulate it, to a lesser extent, because then the

643
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,600
knowledge can take good quicker, and then obviously you become it, it doesn't mean like

644
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:03,160
somebody will keep the presets less if they understand, on the contrary, they need to

645
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:08,920
worry less about the presets when they understand, or if they have more understanding, it will

646
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,960
take good quicker, but for those who don't have, who have lots of faith, and then just

647
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:21,160
emulate heavily, they really need to take a whole new level of emulation, and then it

648
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:27,680
will take good, you know, with a little knowledge, they might have, but they need life, without

649
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,560
any knowledge, as I said, you can emulate the principle all you want, they were very

650
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,480
wholesome like, we become very authentic, but you can still remember to do that if nobody

651
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:42,320
bought you, but today it's kind of impossible, because today nobody emulates the principle

652
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:47,240
of wholesome living, and those who do, do it as a result of the Buddhist instruction, which

653
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:54,840
means, those family of the principal are already familiar enough with the Buddhist teaching,

654
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,480
they may not all go into all the details that we just talked about, for example, conceiving

655
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,520
and stuff, but they don't need to, so they emulate, you see, they're familiar with the

656
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,160
principle, and then you start discerning that that is how things actually are, not yours,

657
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:14,120
not for you, not in your control, not possible to actually be affected by last, not possible

658
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:23,680
to be affected by a way, not possible to be affected by the illusion, pain that is, and

659
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:31,000
then all the factors will fall off, it's a slow reprocess, then the one who is emulating

660
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:38,000
the principle and actively trying to understand it, but to double, yeah, double, but basically

661
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:51,000
you fight in both fronts, but it's the same relation, it's the same result, and it's

662
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,520
the same relation, yeah, it's just always, if somebody is just emulating the principle,

663
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:01,160
I'm not trying to understand the principle as well, then you might have people with greater

664
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:08,240
intellectual capacities, they can understand the principle with actually quite a pure emulation,

665
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,840
they seal it, no, actually develop properly, but they have quite, quite some intelligence

666
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:18,200
they can discern, and then we'll develop, but until they develop and they seal it properly,

667
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,320
this understanding of that principle will not reach to fulfillment, that's what sort

668
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:29,800
of buttons, who have seal us efficiently for sort of party, but not our hands yet, they

669
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:37,560
need to keep practicing nekama, renunciation, restraint, and feel the principle fully

670
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:43,240
when it's everything, so they just need to stick to the virtuous living, sort of on us,

671
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:52,400
and they'll become our hands, because they've fully understood the principle, oh, the

672
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:58,360
ones who didn't stick to the virtuous living, they didn't compromise their understanding,

673
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:04,280
they just slowed down their progress, like the sort of buttons in the suit as I mentioned,

674
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:11,080
or in the minerals, you know, the drinking, like lay people as well, he was a sort of

675
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:18,200
button, but he was drunk and so on, so he wasn't keeping the principles, why, because he

676
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:25,480
had faculties developed, to such an extent that he could discern the principle at the

677
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:30,240
very little occasion, where he did keep the priests, where he did live also many, and

678
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,960
he discerned the principle, then, you know, his habit and last took him over, but the

679
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:41,400
principle was discerned, so at most in several lifetimes he would have brought it to fulfillment,

680
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,360
and there's a thing that says when he's discerning the principle, he's virtuous, so at the

681
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:51,760
moment of death, when you can't engage in anything circumstantial, he is that principle,

682
01:12:51,760 --> 01:13:09,640
that's why it's often, it's such a prominent kind of role of that in the suit, when somebody

683
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,960
who has the right view, or who is, who's only a mere each, oh well, he might attend,

684
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,240
he doesn't attend the fruits of his understanding, he is slightly attending the moment of death,

685
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:27,680
because it's where the principle is, not mine, not for me, not in my control, that's what

686
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:31,600
death is, the manifestation of death, you can abide in that for quite some, you know,

687
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,160
well you can develop it before you actually go through it, that's where the German died

688
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:42,160
before you die, he didn't mean that in a poetic, inspirational way as well, it's quite a

689
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:47,200
fact, die before you die, go where the death is, and abandon it yourself before it hits

690
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:54,640
you, go where the death is, yes, go where the death is, because death is everything opposite

691
01:13:54,640 --> 01:14:01,920
of my life, death is the ultimate not yours, you can think, you own death, you can think

692
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:07,120
you're ready for death, only arrogance is ready for death, because there's no, no holding

693
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:14,520
of any form of life, any form of Baba, any form of meaning, but for Patugina, death always

694
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:23,760
comes from the opposite way you're looking at, it always comes from behind, from behind

695
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:30,360
your attention, from underneath you feel, which means you can never be prepared for death,

696
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:36,080
that's Patugina, that's so explainable, so explainable you can, but you will still experience

697
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:42,380
some anguish in regard to it, because well, because you have left work, I'm done, you

698
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:48,360
can just do the principle, but you haven't been emulating it sufficiently, for it permeate

699
01:14:48,360 --> 01:15:12,740
everything and make all of the factors evaporate in this day, where's your boy, good sleep,

700
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:23,260
so perfectly emulating all some living, see the danger in the slightest fault, with the

701
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:27,620
instruction that you already have, with the decircumnication that you already have, you

702
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:32,780
will probably be the tenth of it, he will be enough, but it needs to be done, it needs

703
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:42,600
to be stuck to and maintained, for our long well that that can be only known in hindsight,

704
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:48,040
Once you get it, once you once, once the mind knows that it knows, then you can say, okay, well,

705
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,440
took me only a four-night.

706
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,040
It took me only seven years.

707
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,280
It took me only seventeen years.

708
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,720
In a long scheme of things, it's nothing.

709
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:13,000
Took me only this like that.

710
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:46,680
Because investigation of Thomas investigation is cannot be very painful.

711
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:54,200
Yeah, trying to think, thinking about these things too.

712
01:16:54,200 --> 01:17:01,400
Well, it's painful in the beginning, because you don't really know what to think about,

713
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:08,040
and how to think about, so then it requires, once you know, then you will be able to tune in your

714
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:15,320
effort. So you won't be ashamed. You won't be painful. Just thinking about them, I see,

715
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:21,240
like, you think I have to think about these things. You can say that, but basically it's more

716
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:25,000
accurate. You have to discern these things within what has already risen, the demos they have

717
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,480
already risen. You just need to change the way of looking at what's already right in front of

718
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:34,120
you all the time, and you're not just about it. You're not fabricating anything new,

719
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:41,640
you're just discerning within what's already there. And that's actually quite effortless.

720
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:54,200
Because really, you're renunciation, you're just keeping the precepts.

721
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,080
Yeah, and we're not in there. Yeah, can you walk some pain?

722
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,760
Looking up to your thoughts, probably, keeping the precepts. Yeah.

723
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:06,440
That's, yeah, they can walk pain, of course. But even that, you know, all the pain in the

724
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:14,200
beginning, the same as giving up any habits, central habits in particular. Because the pain in

725
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:19,160
the beginning, but then after what it doesn't, it evolves the pain in the beginning because you're

726
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:25,160
just too dependent on, you know, the non-renunciation. But if you stick with renunciation,

727
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,960
then you recognize what actually, you know, this is the natural state of things which,

728
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,040
it's a sensuality that requires the effort, not other way around.

729
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,840
The renunciation has a required effort. It requires the effort when you will mind

730
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:42,040
distal center upon the sensuality. And saying no to it requires the effort when you start discerning,

731
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:48,200
that that is the, that is the correct order. Sensuality is circumstantial,

732
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:53,640
arisen on the basis of non-sensuality. Thus, it's sensuality that requires effort.

733
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,840
So by not engaging in sensuality, you're effortless. No burden, no pressure.

734
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:04,440
And then your mind just won't go to sensuality because that's, that which needs effort,

735
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:10,120
not the current state. But that wouldn't have happened if you haven't been emulating the current state

736
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:14,360
beforehand. If you haven't been emulating the non-sensuality beforehand.

737
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:26,440
I thought it delighting the renunciation. No, it's secluded. It's effortless. You have to do that.

738
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:36,120
And that's just without all the other more important methods of not exposing yourself to danger and

739
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:51,640
your mind and everything else. You're freedom. And peace to all of you.
