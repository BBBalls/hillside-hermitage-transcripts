1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So what was the idea?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:21,300
Well, maybe I'll start with a question and see where it takes us.

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:36,300
What is, how would you describe in its content, a thought?

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,300
The images of...

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Of what?

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Of things that I've seen, or that I've perceived.

7
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,300
And images of perception.

8
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,300
Okay, so what is the... and perceptions?

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,300
How do you then know perceptions?

10
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,300
What is a perception in its content?

11
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,300
In its content.

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,300
Yeah.

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,300
Or what you've seen, things that I've seen.

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
In particular, types of science.

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,300
So let's look at something.

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,300
What do we have here?

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,300
Take a measure.

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,300
So you're looking at a tape measure.

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,300
What is in its content, of your sight?

20
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,300
The shape, the colour.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
The shape, the colour.

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
What is the shape?

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Colour in the content.

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
What is the shape, the designation?

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Shape, shape, colour, colour.

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:43,300
What is that, in your mind?

27
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Well, in image, I suppose it's the closest thing I can...

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
Sure?

29
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
It's a...

30
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,300
Yeah, that's fine.

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,300
We can call it an image.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,300
So it's an image.

33
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,300
So then, is your perception an image?

34
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,300
An actual perception?

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Is this also an image?

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,300
In your mind?

37
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,300
Yeah.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
It's a different type.

39
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,300
It's not as...

40
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
What's the difference?

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
What would you mean, different type?

42
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,300
It would look like if I'm imagining a major tape.

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Sure, okay.

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,300
And then when I'm seeing one, it's a different quality.

45
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:35,300
But what is in common?

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,300
What is in common to the sight of a tape measure?

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,300
And now, to your thought of it.

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,300
What is in common?

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,300
The thought.

50
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Sure.

51
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,300
But what is the content of the thought then?

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Like, because you have an abstract thought, a natural thought, theoretical, clear, ambiguous...

53
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Why do they all have in common?

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,300
Why do all thoughts have in common?

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
They have thoughts.

56
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,300
But in terms of the content, why do they all have in common?

57
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,300
What is the common characteristic of all the thoughts?

58
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Why do they all have?

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,300
You said it.

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
What are the images?

61
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300
They have an image.

62
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Literally, an image.

63
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,300
So the thought and the image is different?

64
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Well, I'm trying to clarify it here

65
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,300
in the sense that image is like specific.

66
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,300
It's within a thought.

67
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,300
So you can't have thoughts without images.

68
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,300
But images are more precise thoughts, so to speak.

69
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
So you can call them thoughts, dummies.

70
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
You can call them phenomena.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,300
Images of content.

72
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,300
But that's the thing.

73
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,300
You don't start with a pure recognition of image as a content.

74
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:13,300
You start with heavy concepts of abstract thoughts, ideas, designations.

75
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,300
So you need to make the effort through those ideas and designations

76
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,300
to discern a certain enduring container of an image,

77
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,300
which is what gives the identity to a thought as a thought.

78
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
So that's what I mean.

79
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Thought is a more broader application of the term,

80
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,300
but more specifically images.

81
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,300
So can you say something has manifested?

82
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Yeah, those are the characteristics of images.

83
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Exactly, that's what I was going to say.

84
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,300
I can only know that because there's some image there.

85
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Exactly.

86
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
So that's what I'm saying.

87
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
In the same sense, in the previous talk,

88
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,300
we spoke about the resisting aspect of your thought.

89
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
That's what images are,

90
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,300
because you have no say in how things appear to you,

91
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,300
in how it manifested.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Yet that is an image upon which you can think further and further and further.

93
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,300
So yeah, you said correctly,

94
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,300
in a way there is a difference between you imagining your images

95
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
and you perceiving,

96
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
but there is also the common ground to it.

97
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
And that common ground is not an external relation.

98
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,300
That common ground is a necessary container for both.

99
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,300
You wouldn't be able to think this particular day measuring if you've never seen it.

100
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,300
And you've never seen it if you've never had an image in mind of it.

101
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
That's why you can sometimes not see it,

102
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
but I can describe it to you,

103
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,300
and then you can see it and recognize it as the same thing,

104
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,300
because it's the same basis of the same images.

105
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,300
And any difference in my description and what you saw,

106
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,300
if the difference is not sufficient for you to doubt the identity of the thing,

107
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,300
or if you don't realize, oh no, that's the thing he was talking about.

108
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Now I understand it correctly now.

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,300
So perceptions and imagination are mental images.

110
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
So whether you perceive,

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,300
whether you imagine images are there.

112
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,300
So in other words,

113
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,300
perception is basically images of the senses,

114
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,300
and imagination is images upon the images.

115
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,300
But you wouldn't say that an image represents what an image represents?

116
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,300
No, absolutely not.

117
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Because that assumes that you can even conceive rightly

118
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,300
that from which my perception came about.

119
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,300
And how can you know that unless you're perceiving it?

120
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Which means how can you perceive what comes before perception?

121
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
So this is before my perception.

122
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
That's an assumption.

123
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,300
That's an assumption of the external world.

124
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,300
That's how you allow the footing for the matter.

125
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,300
Because it's because of the matter that you perceive.

126
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,300
But see when you're thinking, oh, that's the real matter?

127
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
No, you can only perceive it,

128
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
which means you can only perceive your perception,

129
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
and then you get to assume the matter behind.

130
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,300
So would you say a feeling is an image?

131
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Yes, everything, the manifest is an image,

132
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
on the level of manifestation.

133
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
And that's why I wanted to use the word image,

134
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,300
not the word thought,

135
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
because then people say,

136
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
ah, so only when I think it, it's real?

137
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
No.

138
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,300
You can only think something if the images are there.

139
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
And you don't have to think it.

140
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
You can just look at it.

141
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
And that's the common ground

142
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
that probably many people would struggle to find

143
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,300
between senses, as in the physical and the mental.

144
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
Because it's usually the senses,

145
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
and now I'm in my thoughts as a result of it.

146
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
No.

147
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Whether my thoughts, images are there,

148
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,300
perceptual images are there,

149
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
that's why it's on the level of perception,

150
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
images as well.

151
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
So say somebody,

152
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,300
not mindful that they're kind of,

153
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
not really thinking about what they're doing,

154
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
but they're doing something,

155
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
aiming at towards something.

156
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
So that thing that they're aiming at,

157
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
they're actually aware of what it is they're aiming at.

158
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
But it's still present as an image.

159
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Yeah.

160
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,300
It's just not something that they're actually going on.

161
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
That's the thing that I'm...

162
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
Yeah, exactly.

163
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
I don't know what I want.

164
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
That's the images you're having in mind.

165
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Yeah.

166
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,300
You have a vague, ambiguous direction.

167
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,300
I don't know what I want,

168
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,300
but clearly you're doing something about it in some way,

169
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
which means you have some sense.

170
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
So whatever, a sense, a thought,

171
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,300
ambiguous idea, abstract theory,

172
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
actual perception of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch,

173
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
images are there.

174
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
Because literally,

175
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Dhamma could be translated as an image,

176
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
a phenomenon, an image,

177
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,300
a thing, yeah.

178
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,300
So, would you say

179
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,300
the image is also, like,

180
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,300
what's designated, the designation

181
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,300
of whatever it is that's manifested.

182
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
So something's there,

183
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,300
it's designated in some way, that's the image.

184
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
That's already the beginning of your designation, sure.

185
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Yeah.

186
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Okay.

187
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Can you have an image without a color of it?

188
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300
No.

189
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Exactly.

190
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
So that's why the Buddha described perception

191
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
in its fundamental terms.

192
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,300
He perceives yellow, white, blue,

193
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
white, red.

194
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
That's it.

195
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,300
But you can have an image without flavor,

196
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,300
sound, smell.

197
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Sure, you can.

198
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,300
But you can't have an image without a color,

199
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,300
without space.

200
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Without space, exactly.

201
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
That's why you can use space practically

202
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
to summon the senses.

203
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,300
You can have an image without a touch.

204
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Yeah, I suppose.

205
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,300
It's like, there's not much you can designate,

206
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,300
not much difference in designate between the touch.

207
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Your first point of touch is the first point of resistance,

208
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
which is this body as a whole.

209
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
So the image will then stand for that,

210
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
but it's not what you can describe about that.

211
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,300
But if you want to describe the characteristic of an image,

212
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
yeah, it has to be color, it has to be shape,

213
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
which means it has to have space,

214
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
it has to be off-space.

215
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
It has to be sound.

216
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Not really.

217
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,300
So if I have an image of a taste,

218
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
I have the image of a taste,

219
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
the experience of a taste,

220
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
there's something salty.

221
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Yeah, can you imagine?

222
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Saltyness without color.

223
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Yeah, you can.

224
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Can you imagine color without saltiness?

225
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
You can.

226
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,300
Because the senses also, they're not linear.

227
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,300
The whole arrangement,

228
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,300
the material arrangement of the sense organs,

229
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,300
is such.

230
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,300
It has its own arrangement.

231
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,300
They're not all on the same field, so to speak,

232
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,300
on the same level ground.

233
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,300
So, but can you also, can you even,

234
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:48,300
can you imagine saltiness

235
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
without tasting it?

236
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Like you can have, you can have the idea of saltiness,

237
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
but it's already quite secondary.

238
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,300
But you can imagine blue,

239
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,300
and it will go all the way to the point of the image,

240
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
whatever.

241
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
You can imagine yellow.

242
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Literally, you have an image of yellow in your mind.

243
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,300
But saltiness, without tasting,

244
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
you're not tasting it in your mouth.

245
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,300
You can be hoping to taste it,

246
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:23,300
but it's going to be more on the level of a secondary concept.

247
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Because you'll be really, when you imagine saltiness,

248
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,300
you're imagining yourself eating some salty food,

249
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,300
which is more like images of colors and shapes

250
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
that you're consuming.

251
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
They then get to taste like this.

252
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
You're going to say salt is in white.

253
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Sure.

254
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,300
So the perception of salt is experienced through the eye.

255
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Well, that's why the kind of,

256
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
the obsession is, sorry,

257
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,300
the perception of the image of tastes.

258
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
The image of tastes.

259
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
The image of tastes.

260
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
So not the perception of tastes.

261
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
In a way, yes.

262
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
Not specifically through the eye,

263
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
but you could say through the mental eye.

264
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
There has to be an image there.

265
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Even if you were like blind your whole life,

266
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,300
you will have to have an image of your experience

267
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,300
as a whole of consuming some object in your mouth

268
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
as producing the salty taste for you.

269
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:20,300
But you can't imagine the pure saltiness in itself.

270
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
But that's beside the point now,

271
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
how these particular senses, which comes first,

272
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
doesn't matter.

273
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Whichever way they come,

274
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
an image has to be there.

275
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
And if people were confused

276
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
why would you be describing the perception

277
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
in terms of colors, these images,

278
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
it's because, yeah, that's what it would boil down to.

279
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
And you can describe it also in terms of space.

280
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
That's where space is sometimes listed

281
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
as one of the elements.

282
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
It's not a fundamental element,

283
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
like four Mahabutas,

284
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,300
but it's out there with consciousness

285
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
and other Mahabutas,

286
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:58,300
so like the six elements.

287
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,300
So you said, why everything,

288
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
every image has a color?

289
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,300
First, every image is.

290
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
Because now when you think every image has a color,

291
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,300
they're saying color, it's another image for you.

292
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
So what you're really saying is

293
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,300
every image has an image.

294
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
And that's true,

295
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
but that's not practically accurate.

296
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
So there is an image

297
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
within which you discern the properties of color,

298
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:36,300
characteristics of it being manifested.

299
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
So think space.

300
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
When I say space,

301
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,300
what image is present in your mind?

302
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Space, space.

303
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
What's present in your mind?

304
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Well, something clear.

305
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Something clear.

306
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
When I say space,

307
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
what's present in my mind is the word space,

308
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
literally.

309
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
OK.

310
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Written word space is what's present in my mind.

311
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
But yeah, whatever.

312
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
I was thinking expansive, sort of.

313
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
The point is there has to be an image.

314
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
There has to be an image.

315
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
There has to be an image.

316
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,300
If I say, I don't know,

317
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
a term in another language

318
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
that you don't understand,

319
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,300
you still have to have an image in your mind

320
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
on the basis of sound

321
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
that I just produced at you.

322
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
You will have an image of

323
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
what does that mean?

324
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Is this gibberish or this particular language

325
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,300
or you will have to have some image always.

326
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
There is no such thing as an imageless mind,

327
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,300
unless neither perception or perception and so on.

328
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
OK.

329
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Even space, basis of infinite space

330
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
is basis of infinite image.

331
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
Yeah.

332
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
Image of infiniteness of space.

333
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,300
But both narrowly, even if you're not,

334
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
there's something's gone.

335
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
There's an image.

336
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Within that image,

337
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
you will discern various perceptions.

338
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Well, within that image,

339
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
you'll discern the five senses.

340
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Within that image,

341
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
you'll discern more images.

342
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Within that image,

343
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
you'll discern your intentions.

344
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Yeah.

345
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,300
So there's a kind of

346
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
a sort of starting image,

347
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
which is basically the image of this experience.

348
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Yeah.

349
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
And the starting image does not disappear

350
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,300
when the second thing comes in.

351
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,300
The starting image remains as a primary soul,

352
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
only container in which

353
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
you can't be outside of it.

354
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
That's where the mind comes first.

355
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
The image comes first.

356
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
So primary image.

357
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
You're thinking there's a side of this image

358
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,300
that isn't yours?

359
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
There's another image.

360
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Within this image.

361
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
That image is what experiences are.

362
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Sorry?

363
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Experience as a whole.

364
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Yeah.

365
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Of course.

366
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
That's what the image looks like.

367
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Experience as a whole.

368
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
When I say,

369
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,300
imagine your experience as a whole.

370
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Or don't imagine your experience as a whole.

371
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Come back to the body.

372
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Be here now.

373
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Present.

374
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
Be present moment.

375
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
What is present with you

376
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
in the most acute sense?

377
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,300
You are not specifically looking, looking well.

378
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
I might be doing,

379
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
if I'm doing some sort of meditation technique,

380
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,300
but if I'm not falling into that trap,

381
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
and so you just want to be present,

382
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,300
what is the closest thing to you?

383
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
It's an image of this experience.

384
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
That is a whole thing.

385
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
This experience.

386
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
So that's the point.

387
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,300
You can't really have anything other than that,

388
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
even if you want to.

389
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
But the problem is when you have images,

390
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
yet here you are,

391
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,300
thinking you're observing the actual form.

392
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
You think you're observing the matter,

393
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
the reality behind.

394
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,300
You think you're observing physical sensations and whatnot.

395
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,300
All you're observing is images enduring,

396
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
on account of which you end up

397
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,300
misconceiving those images as matter,

398
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,300
misconceiving those images as feelings,

399
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
as perceptions, as intentions,

400
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
as basically,

401
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
misconceiving the aggregates.

402
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Or rather, conceiving the aggregates,

403
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
giving them the being,

404
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,300
assuming them, appropriating them.

405
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Think about me, myself.

406
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Can you even think that without an image?

407
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
A certain degree,

408
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,300
a certain independence of that aspect,

409
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
of that thought I am.

410
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,300
There's a certain shape to it,

411
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,300
but usually gets associated with your own face.

412
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,300
It's like veiled in the background,

413
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
but the point is an image is there.

414
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
It doesn't matter how ambiguous,

415
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
how subtle,

416
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
image has to be there.

417
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
And not being trained in regard to those images

418
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,300
means not being trained in regard to your mind.

419
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,300
And that's how you will always then be governed

420
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
by the kind of these assumed directions

421
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
that these images take you.

422
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Image of my face means me, I am,

423
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,300
my control, master, owner,

424
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
appropriator, all that's implied.

425
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Not seeing it, you took it upon yourself.

426
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,300
So leave your mind blank.

427
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,300
What is that?

428
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,300
You can.

429
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
What is that?

430
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
It's another image.

431
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,300
So yeah, it's not truly blank.

432
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Because, well,

433
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
how can you even designate blankness

434
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
unless it's absence of something else,

435
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
which is then an image present in your mind

436
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,300
in regard to this,

437
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,300
which is absence of that image?

438
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Think about the empty room.

439
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Yeah, well, yeah.

440
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
So see, that's the whole,

441
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
the sign of emptiness

442
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,300
that the Buddha was talking about.

443
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Imagine when you go into the empty hut

444
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
and you realize this place

445
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,300
is empty of other people.

446
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
So it's actually factually perceiving an image

447
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,300
of absence of others.

448
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Fully develop that image and then apply to yourself.

449
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Oh, so so is this experience as a whole

450
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
in its entirety.

451
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,300
This image is absent of persons.

452
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
That's it.

453
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Because you clarified the sign of emptiness,

454
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
the characteristics of emptiness,

455
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
means you see there's a clear image.

456
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
Now you see it also pertaining

457
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
to your own experience as a whole.

458
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
It's not empty, empty, just space out

459
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,300
and joules sort of us out unconscious.

460
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
No, it's empty of this.

461
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
This experience is empty of lust.

462
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
It's empty of aversion.

463
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,300
It's empty of delusion.

464
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
So if I say emptiness,

465
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,300
what's present in mind?

466
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Emptiness.

467
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
What image is there?

468
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Well, nothingness.

469
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,300
Okay, so what are the characteristics of nothingness?

470
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Empty.

471
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
What is the characteristic of empty space?

472
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
So then the space is there.

473
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,300
So there is a certain container,

474
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
but it's empty.

475
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
So things that...

476
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Things could be in there.

477
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Yeah, but the point is,

478
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
so things that are making the space empty

479
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,300
are there as absence,

480
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,300
as a negative presence.

481
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Because if there is nothing that could be in there,

482
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
you wouldn't say this is empty or so.

483
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,300
It would just be this is so.

484
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,300
So the nothingness of what then?

485
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Nothingness.

486
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
When I ask you emptiness,

487
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
what do you say?

488
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
Oh, nothingness.

489
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,300
I say, well, what is the characteristic of nothingness?

490
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
Okay, characteristic is empty space.

491
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Empty of what?

492
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
That space? Empty of what?

493
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
What is the absence in that space,

494
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
in that nothingness?

495
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
That comes to your mind when I keep repeating

496
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,300
nothingness, nothingness, nothingness, nothingness.

497
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Well, there's not this...

498
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
the absence of something.

499
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Absence of something, well,

500
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
but that's already something, isn't it?

501
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Nothingness.

502
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
What I said is something.

503
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
So you can't say it's absence of something,

504
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,300
because then it's not absence of itself.

505
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,300
So more specifically, nothingness,

506
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,300
or emptiness, more accurately.

507
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Empty of what?

508
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Empty of everything else that's not there.

509
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,300
What are the characteristics of being empty?

510
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Don't necessarily look for the...

511
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
It's empty of this, of this, of this.

512
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Characteristics of being empty.

513
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Can we just describe it?

514
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
It has to be kind of negative.

515
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Exactly.

516
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Negative presence, or presence of absence.

517
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
So it's well on the presence of absence.

518
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Really empty.

519
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
It's not really empty, as in it's not really empty,

520
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,300
and you assume the external world of real absence of things,

521
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,300
which is inconceivable.

522
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
It's not really empty.

523
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
You can't even finish that sentence

524
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
if things were truly empty,

525
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
as in don't exist.

526
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Emptiness is not non-existence.

527
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
It's only emptiness of certain things.

528
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
But people are used to, well,

529
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
not seeing the images in their mind,

530
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
and then just following the kind of

531
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,300
the positive directions of craving, pretty much.

532
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
You say something like it's a pure image.

533
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Let's finish with this.

534
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Okay.

535
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300
So the point is emptiness.

536
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
It's an image in your mind.

537
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
Like you can even say,

538
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
when I say emptiness, I just have a word emptiness

539
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
written in my mind, big E.

540
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
Okay.

541
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,300
So what are the characteristics of something being empty?

542
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
You said, well, it's an empty space.

543
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Okay.

544
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,300
Empty space is defined as an empty space

545
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,300
by absence of that which is empty of.

546
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
That is its characteristic.

547
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
That's what definition of emptiness is.

548
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Doesn't matter what is empty of.

549
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,300
So it's a negative presence,

550
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,300
or presence of the absence of certain things.

551
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Dwell on that image.

552
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Presence of absence, basically.

553
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,300
It's not a contradiction because absence...

554
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Is a thing.

555
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
Is a thing that is present.

556
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,300
So it's the content of that that's not there,

557
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,300
but the nature of absence is there.

558
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
What else does it matter?

559
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,300
The same principle in your experience then.

560
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Yes, sense of ownership, sense of master controller,

561
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,300
because I am here, where?

562
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,300
What is the content of my sense of self?

563
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
Can you find it?

564
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Can you find the content of what you are?

565
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
But you are.

566
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
It's always a negative.

567
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,300
So the absence of content is your presence.

568
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,300
And that's why sense of self is assumed in regard to everything and nothing.

569
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
But once you study...

570
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
Oh, so the absence...

571
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,300
Sorry, the presence of the absence is a real image.

572
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
I don't need to keep chasing content

573
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,300
and only to verify the image through finding the content.

574
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
No, it's other way around.

575
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,300
So by understanding the nature of emptiness

576
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
you get to understand the nature of anata.

577
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,300
And that's why this room is empty of others.

578
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,300
And his mind is established upon the perception of that image.

579
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,300
So is this body, these five aggregates,

580
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,300
are empty of the self as in the self master controller.

581
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Empty.

582
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,300
So there is the sense of self that is the presence, absence of the owner.

583
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Absence of the owner means non-ownership.

584
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,300
Doesn't mean there was never ever presence of the absent owner.

585
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Sense of self is absent owner.

586
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Not seeing it as an absent owner,

587
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,300
well, you get to then appropriate everything that you assume that self owns.

588
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,300
But you realize that self can only be the absence of the actual owner,

589
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,300
then yourself becomes not self, automatically.

590
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:11,300
So back onto the images then.

591
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,300
It's important to emphasize

592
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,300
your seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching

593
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:27,300
would not be so unless it's already an image in itself.

594
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Also, it's all in my mind then.

595
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
It's all in my thought.

596
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
That's an image that has a reason for it.

597
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,300
So images are neither in your head nor in the things.

598
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
It's just there in the middle.

599
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Something is there.

600
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
Something is there.

601
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,300
Images are that manifestation, that arising that Buddha talks about.

602
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
That's what images are.

603
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Within that you can discern now the direction, the content of the sense objects

604
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
or the absence of sense objects.

605
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,300
You can discern the content of further images in your mind

606
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:04,300
as in your own abstract thinking and so on.

607
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,300
And the crucial characteristic of these images is that

608
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,300
you don't create them.

609
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
No.

610
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,300
That's what I mean.

611
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Based on the previous talk we've done about the aspect of resistance

612
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,300
in your thoughts, that's what images are.

613
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,300
That which resists already has some shape, already has some form.

614
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
So to speak, you wouldn't recognize if it wasn't.

615
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,300
Absolutely.

616
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,300
In some way, there was an image there.

617
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Yeah, exactly.

618
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
It would not be known.

619
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,300
Resistance is already an image.

620
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,300
Yeah, exactly.

621
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,300
You cannot think of resistance and then the image resists.

622
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,300
No, resistance is an image.

623
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Resistance is already a designation.

624
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
But there can't be an image.

625
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Designation already resists.

626
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,300
Without resistance.

627
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Exactly.

628
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,300
Either way, an image needs to be there.

629
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
So they're all equal footing those two.

630
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
They're not like one.

631
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,300
And you could see how it could perhaps make more sense then.

632
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:00,300
You could see how it could establish your mind upon the basis of infinite space.

633
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:07,300
The image of infinity, the actual resisting aspect of the thought of infinity, that is

634
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
what infinity is.

635
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Fully understand it.

636
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Fully invest effort in it.

637
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,300
As we said, fully develop theme of it.

638
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,300
As it fully discern the science of infinity, infinite space.

639
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,300
And then you'll be dwelling and abiding in it.

640
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:31,300
Whether you're walking, sitting, eating, lying down, going to toilet, your mind will be within

641
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,300
that container of infinity.

642
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Meaning that you're including all...

643
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,300
Meaning that whatever comes to that will be inferior to it, as the Buddha would describe

644
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,300
it.

645
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Being inferior to it, if you find it completely dispassionate about it, includes all resistance.

646
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,300
An image that includes all the other images you're used to.

647
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:00,300
Yeah.

648
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,300
So people usually swing between the two, like, I'm looking or I'm thinking.

649
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
I can't see anything in between.

650
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,300
So when you talk about images, these are thoughts.

651
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,300
But now this is the reality of my senses.

652
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
So you don't have to be excluding either.

653
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,300
You want to see what's in common to both.

654
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:23,300
When I have the experience of an image, when I have the experience of a sight, sound, smell, taste, touch.

655
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:30,300
The experience is, there's an image there that isn't present in, presently enduring on its own.

656
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:36,300
I just think it's like the whole philosophical tradition has been swinging.

657
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:41,300
Swinging between the empiricists who were saying the senses come first and then the rationalists

658
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,300
who were saying, no, no, no, the thoughts come first.

659
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Senses and thoughts are only known because they're an image.

660
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
Yeah.

661
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,300
They appear as an image.

662
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:57,300
You're never seeing the middle ground, the middle way.

663
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Practice of casinos is practice of images.

664
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Yeah.

665
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:10,300
As in, the greater images than the images that you kind of encounter in your average experience.

666
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:17,300
That's why casinos of four elements, colours, space and consciousness.

667
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,300
There's not focusing on a desk.

668
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,300
That means focusing on what you're looking at.

669
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,300
If you're not actually seeing it, you can only look at something because it's already an image.

670
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Because it's already known as an image.

671
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,300
It's already appeared as an image.

672
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
It's already enduring as an image.

673
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
So it's more about discerning more.

674
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:37,300
That's why, like, was it the Sariput or who was it?

675
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,300
The block of wood.

676
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
The block of wood.

677
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Mahamogalana.

678
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Discerning it as different.

679
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
Yeah.

680
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,300
As air, as basis of air, basis of water, basis of fire.

681
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Attractive.

682
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Attractive, ugly.

683
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
The same thing.

684
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
Yeah.

685
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
Because it is.

686
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Yeah.

687
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,300
It's the block of wood.

688
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:03,300
It's so far down that if you look at the more general nature of what images it pertains to,

689
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
it has solidity.

690
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,300
The image of solidity is there.

691
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
The image of heat is there.

692
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
And the image of beauty is there.

693
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:20,300
And it's rather that, so the image of solidity is that sort of higher ground where you can

694
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
see the block of wood.

695
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Yeah.

696
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,500
It's within the experience of seeing the block of wood, but you see the higher ground as

697
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,900
coming first structurally, not the block of wood you're staring at.

698
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,300
And that's why the Buddha said, like, when you develop the casinas, like, his mind gets,

699
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,420
like he said, the Manprese then, I don't know, the casino of earth, the mind develops upon

700
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:45,580
the image of earth, image of solid, and that's literally in everything you can ever perceive

701
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,620
has a degree of solid, which means it pertains to the element of earth.

702
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,140
It's within that.

703
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,500
His mind develops upon that, he then develops dispassion, understanding, and escape in regard

704
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,700
to the image of earth.

705
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,980
And what is then to be said about everything that's inferior to it?

706
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,940
He abandoned it completely.

707
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:15,300
Water, fire, air, blue, yellow, light, and so on.

708
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:21,780
The point is, the principle is you get to discern an image on account of your current thought

709
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:27,260
or sense objects, but you get to understand there's an image coming first there.

710
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,140
So for most people, they might discern an image, but they'll always put it second.

711
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,860
So they'll put that which is first and second, and their second sight, they'll put it first.

712
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:42,020
And that's how natural assumption of things from the world first come to me here.

713
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:48,260
As in here, there, between the two, it's already an image of space in your mind.

714
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,660
And that's what's first structurally.

715
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,740
You wouldn't have any concept of distance, movement, intentionality, if the image is

716
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,580
not there, providing you with possibilities of that.

717
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,100
So the image is fundamental.

718
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
Yes.

719
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:10,220
And when you have a thought of now the fundamental, that's an image in your mind.

720
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:17,180
Any particular image, content, has the nature of image.

721
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
Sure.

722
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,620
There is no image, and now you have something different to an image, within an image.

723
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,860
All you can access.

724
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,300
Is images within images?

725
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
You can't step out.

726
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,020
Because any thought of something is not an image.

727
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:39,740
You can have an image of, so I have an image of a tape measure of this yellow thing in

728
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,860
my hand, and now I can, within that, start looking at different components of that thing,

729
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,580
and all of those are further images.

730
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,820
And even if I don't know what this is for, so I don't have a particular purpose in my

731
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:59,660
mind of this thing, of color, I have shape, image of color, shape is already in my mind.

732
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,060
And then, oh, so then there is the image in my mind, and there is a thing in my hand.

733
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,020
Thing in my hand is an image in my mind.

734
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,060
So it's mind within the mind, within the mind, within the mind, within the mind, within the

735
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:14,260
mind, the external world within the mind, the internal thoughts in my abstraction within

736
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
the mind.

737
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,380
So the mind comes first and things can never leave the mind.

738
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,940
That mind, not the mind of abstract thinking which is already within the mind I'm talking

739
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,260
about, as in within the image.

740
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,340
You cannot possibly relate to it, you cannot think it, you cannot designate it, you cannot

741
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,580
even fleetingly be aware of, what was that?

742
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,660
You cannot even ask a question in regard to it, if it's not there at least to some extent

743
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
as an image.

744
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,020
That extent is an extent of an image.

745
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,780
That's why the casino, literal meaning of casino is extent, totality or something, totality

746
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,020
of the extent, or the extent of totality.

747
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,700
You can't be more specific than that, because that's as specific as it is.

748
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,860
Can you ask a question about something?

749
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,860
So you don't know specifically what it is, but there's something you want to ask.

750
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:12,100
Oh, I can't remember what it was, but I have a question.

751
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:18,260
There has to be an image there of that extent, that extent of ambiguity, the extent of lack

752
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
of clarity.

753
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:27,460
Oh, my mind is empty now, it's blank, there is no thoughts in it.

754
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,940
That's the thought of the images there.

755
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:36,860
So you truly conceiving an objective reality free from you is inconceivable, because that's,

756
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,580
you can only even relate to it in a wrong manner, or right manner, in any manner, because

757
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,500
it's there as an image enduring, how can you even talk about it or think it?

758
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:53,620
And so if you're able to discern the extent of image, like the image of manifestation,

759
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,860
then you discern everything that has a nature to manifest.

760
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:02,460
Exactly, and if you also recognize the fact that these images have the characteristic

761
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:08,260
of, I'm subjected to them, I didn't create them.

762
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Yeah, they have a reason to manifest them.

763
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
And there is absolutely no reason for ownership.

764
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,260
They endure, they persist while they're changing, they're enduring.

765
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Images.

766
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:23,820
Oh, I can, I can put this, I can throw it away, I can use it, I can save it, I can do lots

767
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,100
of things, because an image of it is still there for me.

768
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,420
If you had an image of that, it disappears, either through this body being destroyed or

769
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,260
the counterpart that's necessary, whatever, of my senses being destroyed.

770
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Which is also another image, but yeah, at last.

771
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
Which is another image, exactly.

772
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,820
You can't even think of the pure world, pure destruction, pure anything, without having

773
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,540
it manifested as an image in your mind.

774
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:53,060
They're saying you're subjected to images.

775
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,420
So how can you not be subjected?

776
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
What do you think?

777
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:07,660
So, because if you, you know, an image is there for me, so that's, so that's afflicting

778
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,660
me.

779
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,660
Yeah.

780
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,820
In the sense of I'm being subjected to it.

781
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:21,140
But if I see that image is just there, I want to see that image is just there, but there's

782
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,900
an image of for me.

783
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
Yeah.

784
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,740
But that's an image.

785
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,740
Yeah.

786
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,500
So that's secondary to image.

787
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
It's not, why is it secondary?

788
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
It's an image.

789
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,020
Secondary, only in your assumed relationship between the two images, the content of it.

790
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,900
What is the content of for me?

791
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:50,500
Well, it's different in content, like this is not the concept of for me.

792
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,100
What is the content of that tape?

793
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,100
What is the content of it?

794
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,220
Colour, the shape.

795
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,420
And does colour have a content?

796
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,140
They're saying, yeah, yeah.

797
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,540
So I'm saying that when you say content, it's an image, not separate from it.

798
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,700
So it's another image that you yet somehow assume to be the material content of my image.

799
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,460
As if that's not an image.

800
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,460
As if that's not an image, which means any sense of materiality or mentality has to be

801
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,460
within an image.

802
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,460
So type of image.

803
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Type of image.

804
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,460
Yeah.

805
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,460
Why would you worry about that?

806
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,780
It's just instead of two images, start thinking about one.

807
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,660
You said, this is for me.

808
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,780
So there's an image of this, there's an image for me, which is more important there.

809
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,500
The image of this or the image for me?

810
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,580
Well, the image for me, because it's an account for me that I feel and suffer.

811
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,900
So you have an image for me, which has the nature of an image.

812
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,380
So if you understand the nature of an image for me, you understood the nature of all images

813
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,540
that are for you, which is literally anything you would be perceiving.

814
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
So that's what I mean.

815
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,180
It's not like comparing and figuring out the relationship between the two images.

816
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:09,460
Why? Because you're failing to understand the common nature of it, which is it's an image.

817
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:14,100
But if you are thinking about an image that doesn't pertain for me, means now you're thinking

818
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,340
like a second hand sort of, abstractly.

819
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,380
You want to make it relevant, relevant, which means on the fundamental level of the experience,

820
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,060
which is where the appropriation is, where the sense of ownership, sense of atta, everything

821
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
is.

822
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,740
So it's like a suffering.

823
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,540
Suffering, suffering.

824
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,060
What is suffering?

825
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
It's an image.

826
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,060
Whatever.

827
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
What is suffering?

828
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
What is suffering?

829
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
What's present in your mind?

830
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
Suffering.

831
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
What is suffering?

832
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,060
Pain and discomfort.

833
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:51,900
The pain and the discomfort stands for the image of suffering.

834
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,580
It's an image of suffering, image of pain.

835
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,020
So what is the image of pain then?

836
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,820
What are the characteristics of the image of pain?

837
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,220
How would you describe it?

838
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Which is the necessary image for the image of suffering?

839
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,220
What's the image of pain?

840
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Well, it's not, it is the image of pain, I don't know.

841
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Well, again, it's easy.

842
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,220
I don't say it's not one thing.

843
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,220
Whatever you say, it's probably going to be more accurate than to try to think about what

844
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
it is.

845
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:29,380
Because when I say the image of pain, it's all like, where is the image of pain?

846
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,260
The fact that you're thinking about something means there is the image of that there, to

847
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
that extent.

848
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,980
I'm asking you, tell me the extent of the image of pain when I ask you, what is the

849
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,980
image of pain?

850
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,420
I don't tell you, tell me the right image of pain.

851
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,860
What is the extent of the pain when you hear, what's the image of pain?

852
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Displeasure, the uncomfortable, the not wanted.

853
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,740
Not wanted.

854
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,860
So all these things have in common.

855
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
No.

856
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
No.

857
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:04,220
That's in common, that's a common attitude to all these things.

858
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,780
This pleasure, this comfort, no wanting means no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

859
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,660
Is no in things or is no in your attitude in regard to things?

860
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,340
In your attitude.

861
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,140
In your attitude in regard to things you are subjected to.

862
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,300
So where is then the suffering, that you said it has a necessity, image, the resisting

863
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,300
of it.

864
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,220
So it's basically then the suffering is not in the image of pain, the suffering is in

865
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,140
you saying no to the image of pain.

866
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:45,580
But how can you even say no to an image of pain, to an image, without an image?

867
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:50,980
Because saying no to the image of pain implies you having, well, saying no to there is an

868
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,660
image implies you having, you can move outside of the space that has a reason based on the

869
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,460
base of that image.

870
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,660
Saying no to this means you can replace it with something else from the outside, yet

871
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,020
all that is within this you are saying no to.

872
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:15,520
So you are responding to an image, by an image, with another image.

873
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,860
So discerning the nature of images will free you from suffering then, because the image

874
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,740
of pain is not the suffering.

875
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,660
The image of discomfort is not the suffering.

876
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,940
So when I say I am afflicted by images, that is an image.

877
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,940
That's an image.

878
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,460
Which I am afflicted by, that's an image.

879
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,020
Because of another image, which is your attitude of these, which you haven't been seen as an

880
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
image.

881
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,020
Yeah, I'm separating that.

882
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,260
That's what the necessary reason for the right view is seeing the sign of your mind.

883
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,020
And then within the now established sign of where your mind is, you can start to discern

884
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,020
these images.

885
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,740
The sign of the mind is an image.

886
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:02,420
It's the most general image of where my mind is, which most people engage with the senses

887
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,540
in the world today, today at the level they don't see it.

888
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:10,980
That's why it's a necessary condition for becoming Sotipana, sign of the mind.

889
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,100
But now this is even further where we're speaking, where it's basically seeing the presence

890
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,180
of the enduring, resisting images within that mind of me or whatever else.

891
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,900
So not seeing, exactly, not seeing your attitude of, not seeing basically the attitude of resisting

892
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,020
as an image.

893
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:35,020
You kind of give it, gratuitously give it more validity on a kind of, you assume it

894
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,140
separate from all the images you're resisting to.

895
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,900
Can you be resisting an image if there is no image there to begin with?

896
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:51,300
If there is no image of pain, can you be resisting it, inconceivable?

897
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,780
Yet, you somehow assume that you resisting it is the first and then just these things

898
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,900
coming up, moving them away and chasing them away and accepting them and rejecting them.

899
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:08,740
I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of like phenomenology, just recognising the true phenomenon, yeah,

900
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:13,820
they're taken to the extreme of basically, you know, just recognising that there are

901
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:21,100
these images there, these phenomena there that had to be there and that, yeah, they

902
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:26,380
can't not be there and they're so close to you that you normally look through them and

903
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,380
take them for granted.

904
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,260
Yeah, and you will be taking them for granted because by looking through them, you start

905
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,820
seeing further through and that you see further through and that's how the whole sensuality

906
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:41,820
proliferates as well because you're also not indifferent to these things.

907
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:47,340
Every image is simultaneously felt pleasantly or pleasantly or neutrally, has to be.

908
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,340
One of those things has to be.

909
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,020
And given that you have attitude in wanting pleasure or avoiding pain, means some images

910
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,100
will be wanted, which means you'll be going for the content, failing to see the nature

911
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,620
of the image and another images will be rejected, means trying to deny the content, failing

912
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,580
to see the nature of the image.

913
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,140
And that's how you're made bound with the image.

914
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,540
But if you were to see that which is wanted, that which is not wanted, as images, as that

915
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,540
sort of common ground.

916
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,500
That's what I mean, like even these ambiguous things, wanting, do you understand what wanting

917
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
is?

918
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Wanting, wanting.

919
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
How would you describe wanting?

920
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,100
I'll take a particular example.

921
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,100
I want this.

922
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,660
I want to eat.

923
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,900
So what is my wanting in this particular instance?

924
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,900
Yeah.

925
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,100
Okay, so exactly.

926
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,620
So it has to be, it has to be that thing.

927
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,940
So you can do both.

928
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,940
First take that thing.

929
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,340
Did you have any say in the manifestation of an image of that thing?

930
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:49,740
If that thing is not, because I see, I'm not seeing the food now, yet I know I want food.

931
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
How's that possible?

932
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:58,100
If the food is generally entirely, solely, fully material, how can I even think it?

933
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,300
It's not.

934
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Spiritual and mental are images first, and they always remain images.

935
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,100
Now they're images that are sort of images of the senses, and they're images that are

936
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,740
images of the mind, but they're all images.

937
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,980
And while the senses, the five senses operate, they will be the images of the senses.

938
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:28,020
While the mind is there, the mind operates, they will also be the image of the mind.

939
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:33,460
It's not that the images of the senses, and then there are also, you know, the real objects

940
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,460
of the senses.

941
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,100
Again, object of the senses.

942
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,020
Image upon image upon image upon image.

943
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,020
Or an image.

944
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,260
So seeing an image.

945
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,100
Means seeing the mind coming first.

946
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,620
Seeing an image, and always seeing an image.

947
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,300
Well you don't need to, it's really discerning an image.

948
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,020
It's not like I always have to be seeing the image, because you have no choice but to

949
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,020
see anything else.

950
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,020
Yes, discerning that.

951
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,140
But discerning what you're seeing.

952
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,460
So Putujana sees images, that's all he can see.

953
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,700
Arahan sees images, that's all he can see.

954
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,860
The difference is for Putujana, he misconceives images to be there which they're not.

955
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,740
As being separate from his mind.

956
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,740
Yeah.

957
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,740
Whereas...

958
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,740
Well then the whole idea of separation comes from it.

959
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,580
By assuming external, internal, both, neither mind, not mind.

960
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,660
And what we're talking about here is the direction of unification of mind, of Samadhi.

961
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:26,660
Unification, exactly.

962
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,660
That's it.

963
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,660
That's it.

964
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,260
Because you discern the unifying contact, the unifying nature.

965
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,460
That's when I ask you first, I say what's in common?

966
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,060
Do you're looking at a tape measure, and you're thinking about not seeing it?

967
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,060
What's in common?

968
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:45,980
So it's training in regard to the ambiguity of images, not to clarify it into detail,

969
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,980
but to recognize it the extent of its ambiguity.

970
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:55,820
Because it's only ambiguity of the content, ambiguity of the detail.

971
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,660
Not the ambiguity of the nature of images I'm being subjected to.

972
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,660
That's what I mean.

973
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:05,060
And not being able to grip with that kind of recognition of that ambiguity, that's why

974
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:11,460
you don't like wanting, not wanting, all these terms become abstract for most people.

975
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,420
And let alone if you start thinking about emptiness, not self, impermanence, well imagine

976
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,900
how abstract that is.

977
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,380
And abstract means you're not seeing it, that's it.

978
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,220
You're not seeing an image of it.

979
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,780
You're thinking it, which is already a second.

980
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,980
You have a thought, but you aren't seeing that thought as the image that it is.

981
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,980
Exactly.

982
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,900
As an image, and you're misconceiving that thought.

983
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

984
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,620
Because there is an image there, whether you see it or not.

985
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:47,620
So literally any attitude, as a wanting, so wanting requires you.

986
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,780
So let's dwell on the you aspect of wanting.

987
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,780
Me.

988
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,780
What is the image of me?

989
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:59,460
The image that comes to mind, the most ambiguous, distant, me, me, me, me, shape of a body.

990
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,460
Exactly.

991
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,780
But that's what it stands for.

992
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,780
Yeah, yeah.

993
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,780
You're not thinking about it, and you end up having all this attitude that it's more

994
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,780
than that.

995
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,260
But whenever you think, that's all it is.

996
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,620
Shape of the body, memory of the face that you see in reflection, place, first point

997
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,140
of view, yeah, place, me, this.

998
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:26,620
So while you have that image of shape of the body as me, which is me, to have any say in

999
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:31,220
how that shape of the body has been manifested for me, subjective, what came before, after,

1000
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,780
can I even approach it on a step outside of it?

1001
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,900
Or am I always secondary to that shape of the body?

1002
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:44,780
Or that memory of the face, of my own face, that stands for when I think of me in my own

1003
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,780
name?

1004
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,780
No.

1005
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:53,180
Because you were basically locked inside of it, or, sorry, locked inside of it more accurately.

1006
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:58,500
Like, if you look left, right, up or down, whatever, you will be in it.

1007
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Yeah.

1008
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,780
Oh, so how can I then be the owner of this when all of this has been subjected to these

1009
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,780
images?

1010
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,780
That's all unsubjected, as well.

1011
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,780
That's all unsubjected.

1012
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,260
There's nothing outside that.

1013
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,220
Oh, but there's more, there's an image of more.

1014
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,180
Because you're from a big duty of an extent, more.

1015
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,220
Ah, but that's an image.

1016
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,220
Yeah.

1017
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,220
Yeah, I'm subjected to it.

1018
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:35,260
But I don't like the I am subjected to images, saying that because it gives me the impression

1019
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,260
that I...

1020
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,260
Well, it gives you space to be separate from it.

1021
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,260
I am subjected to these images.

1022
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,780
But you have to start like that.

1023
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,780
Sure, sure, sure.

1024
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:49,260
But about the body, the senses, the mind is subjected to images.

1025
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,780
That's what a mind is.

1026
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,460
You can't, there can't be a mind without images.

1027
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,660
But if I say manifestation is subjected to...

1028
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,820
Yeah, that's absolutely fine.

1029
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,260
If that becomes a more accurate way of describing it for you, that's fine.

1030
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,140
But for most people, in order to start, you have to start like that and then eventually

1031
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,620
you come to click, okay, but I'm subjected to this, I'm subjected to that, I'm subjected

1032
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,620
to that.

1033
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,620
I am.

1034
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,620
I am.

1035
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,620
Hmm.

1036
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,620
Well, isn't that another image?

1037
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,620
I'm subjected to it.

1038
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,380
And then you get to upgrade your own description.

1039
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,780
But as I said, the starting point is the point of ignorance, the point of mis-conceiving,

1040
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:36,620
which means you will not be able to cease immediately things like the Arahant does, approximating

1041
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,620
how Arahant sees you get to understand what Arahant is.

1042
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,020
Which is what makes you become one.

1043
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,020
All dhammas are another, not self.

1044
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,500
Because not self is an image, or self is an image.

1045
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:58,900
Well, you could say that, yeah, the sense of self, as you say, as we kind of just described,

1046
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:06,580
it kind of becomes a more fundamental image than everything else that comes to your senses.

1047
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:10,540
Like whether I'm seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, as you said yourself, it's for me.

1048
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,460
So it's that image is in common to all these senses.

1049
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,860
So what if I were to then understand and abandon that image, abandon in the sense of

1050
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,180
experiencing dispassion and remove the ownership of it, you have removed the ownership of the

1051
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,700
five senses.

1052
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,740
You have removed sensuality, sense desires.

1053
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,420
By removing the ownership of this image of self.

1054
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,420
Yeah.

1055
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,420
Exactly.

1056
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,420
That all these things come through.

1057
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:42,260
That's what we meant by establishing your mind upon the totality of the extent of solidity,

1058
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,580
totality of the extent of erineness or whatever I want to translate it.

1059
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:51,700
Basically by practicing casinas, you establish your mind to a certain level, everything inferior

1060
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,580
to that is abandoned, or you know, perceptions of the forest to abandon perceptions of the

1061
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,580
village.

1062
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,900
They had inferior perceptions in regard to that.

1063
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,900
As in either way, which doesn't matter how particular perceptions get, this is what they

1064
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,860
have in common and you abandon that common ground.

1065
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:11,140
So whether it's sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, the common ground is image of me, for

1066
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,540
me, mine, I am.

1067
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:21,900
You abandon that, you abandon all these inferior images within that image.

1068
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,620
And by abandoning means not preventing it from arising because you haven't created its

1069
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,620
arising to begin with.

1070
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,100
It was never a problem.

1071
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:36,300
Abandoning means removing the gratuitous attitudes of resisting it or craving for it.

1072
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,220
You will crave for things for as long as you think you can crave for things.

1073
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:44,500
Full understanding that craving is impossible, the way you assumed it, that's how you stop

1074
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,500
assuming.

1075
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,420
How can you crave for something that's already there?

1076
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,420
Exactly.

1077
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:57,580
As I said, oh, I don't see the food now, but I want to crave the food.

1078
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:04,180
If my craving is in the food, if the food is the craving, I would need to be in contact

1079
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,260
with it in order to crave for it.

1080
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,260
But you are.

1081
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,260
I don't even have food.

1082
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,820
But you are in contact with it.

1083
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,820
Exactly.

1084
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,460
But not the content on the domain that I'm craving for.

1085
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,460
No, no, no, with the image.

1086
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,460
Exactly.

1087
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,580
So you realize, oh, so my craving is then on the level of the image yet, I don't stay

1088
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:23,620
on the level of the image when I crave, I go out and seek food and steal food and attack

1089
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:29,660
and kill and work and earn whatever, rightly or wrongly, I go out and seek these objects

1090
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:35,780
because I crave in regard to the image of food.

1091
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:40,540
And that gets paired then with a discomfort of hunger.

1092
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:47,620
So they're naturally associating then seeking this food that I can put in my belly, alleviates,

1093
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:55,260
my gratuitous attitude of resisting pain or physical nature, discomfort of hunger.

1094
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:00,300
But discomfort of hunger, again, it's an image.

1095
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,780
An image that literally you can put anything in your mouth, eat it.

1096
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,500
You wouldn't worry about the taste then, because you fully stay with the discomfort of the

1097
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,500
hunger as a context.

1098
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,060
Okay, I have to deal with this, discomfort, because the body will die.

1099
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,500
I don't need to crave for it in order to do it, but most people don't act on that level

1100
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:22,700
or most people act on another whole layer added to it, which is, yeah, I'm hungry, but

1101
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:26,540
I want particular taste.

1102
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:31,060
And that's another image that can never be anything other than an image.

1103
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:38,860
But you assume taste to be in the objects of your senses, which is another image.

1104
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:45,860
But you assume the materiality of it, independent of you, and that's why sensuality is wrong,

1105
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,940
because it's a perversion of the right order of things.

1106
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:57,260
If you weren't perverting the order, it wouldn't be unwholesome, it wouldn't be wrong.

1107
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:02,060
So things that don't pervert the order are not wrong, such as hunger, putting something

1108
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,660
in your stomachs, you're not hungry.

1109
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:14,660
You don't misconceive what comes first, and the purpose then cannot become corrupted.

1110
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:19,620
That's the whole instruction of the word to mindfully, eat mindfully, as in not to observe

1111
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,820
every movement of your tongue, but mindful of the purpose why you're eating it.

1112
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,180
Like I will eat for this reason, for this reason, I will not eat for this reason, that's

1113
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:36,060
the mindfulness of eating, not chewing, chewing, slowly, slowly, chugging, chugging, chugging.

1114
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,060
Yeah.

1115
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,980
No, why am I eating is because hunger is there.

1116
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,380
So you have an image of hunger.

1117
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:46,940
Image of hunger disappears, as in non-gets replaced image of non-hunger, you stop eating.

1118
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:52,020
Not even a second, what if this taste, because all that became far removed now.

1119
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,740
There was never the purpose of the taste to begin with.

1120
00:56:54,740 --> 00:57:01,020
The only reason you were even attracted to tastes is because of the pressure of the hunger.

1121
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:05,940
Yet you completely then, as a result of it, gratuitously assumed taste to being the matter

1122
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:11,980
of things that you can somehow access through your eating, access the external world, that's

1123
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,940
another image in your mind.

1124
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:19,180
But you think, that's not an image, that's the world, that's the reality.

1125
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,980
And by doing so, you always remain bound to then that extent of assumption.

1126
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:28,340
That's the sensuality, the sensual thirst, wanting the object.

1127
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:34,020
How can you want the object unless there is an image of that you're wanting in your mind?

1128
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,860
And then what is the object?

1129
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:45,780
And if I'm consuming, crushing, eating, devouring, enjoying, whatever, object, it's another image.

1130
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,660
In escapable, you're fully within that.

1131
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:52,860
And when you fully understand it, you cannot even conceive outside of it.

1132
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:57,820
You stop conceiving outside of it, which is sensual domain, which is the assumption of

1133
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,820
sensuality.

1134
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:06,620
So contemplating images, people, images.

1135
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,660
Contemplating images, not in an abstract sense, but in a sense that they're already there.

1136
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,660
Descerning images.

1137
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,460
Contemplating images means discerning images.

1138
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,940
Whatever it is, my experience is whole, my body.

1139
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,300
Image of the body present here.

1140
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,340
I don't need to look at it.

1141
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,980
The fact that I can see my body is here, even if I close my eyes, means I haven't even

1142
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:29,940
seen the fact that then I can know what to look at when I say my body is here.

1143
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,780
Means I have an image that's there.

1144
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,180
How would you even know where to look for it, unless the image already implies the direction

1145
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:40,580
of the space, the space for this position and so on?

1146
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:46,900
Yeah, I mean, I've got my eyes closed, I've got my eyes open, still an image, like there's

1147
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,900
nothing.

1148
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,900
He's just fundamentally changes that.

1149
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,380
Yeah, there is an image of the senses and the image of the mind.

1150
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,900
The image is there.

1151
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,900
And you have both.

1152
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,740
The image is there, while the image of the senses and the image of the mind is there.

1153
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,980
But you can't attend to it to the same extent.

1154
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,980
Has to be one.

1155
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,980
That's where the six senses is.

1156
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:13,660
So the image is there and the six types of images are there.

1157
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:20,140
On account of the six senses being there.

1158
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,260
That's the sense basis.

1159
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:36,060
It's like a field at the extent that's already an image within which then the sights come,

1160
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,660
which are further images within that extent.

1161
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:46,500
If there is no field where sights are, sights will not be manifested at all.

1162
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:53,100
So understanding the six sense basis means you overcome centrality, not by dealing, managing

1163
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:59,380
or getting rid of the objects of your set's basis, uprooting the framework of the basis,

1164
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:04,100
uprooting and then removing ownership, and misconceiving lack of discernment, not seeing

1165
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:09,100
it as an horizon image, the present in yours.

1166
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:13,860
That's why like suitors that deal with this, they talk about this, often like for people

1167
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,460
who deal with this abstract, sounds abstract, sounds.

1168
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:21,860
And then the idea of abstraction from a mind they cannot understand, the nature of abstraction,

1169
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:28,500
and the other, assuming the extension of this already gratuitously external material reality,

1170
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,060
and then you think all these meditation experiences get to pertain to the extension of this weirdly

1171
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:40,140
assumed external reality, like infinite space.

1172
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:45,140
It's the infinity of space, either perception or perception.

1173
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:59,660
It becomes immediately like this transcendental universe elsewhere from these senses, magically.

1174
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:06,380
Whereas in fact there are images that actually are present, but need to be discerned in order

1175
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,380
to sort of transcend.

1176
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:15,260
Yeah, that's what I said in Majima, one by one, when he's developing all the jhanas and

1177
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:20,020
then all the space of infinite space and so on, he would ask himself, oh he's the mode

1178
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:25,140
in this, as in he's the higher, he's the greater than this, but he wouldn't go around to find

1179
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,140
it.

1180
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,900
He would just look at the same thing and then see that there is more to it.

1181
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:33,460
He would look at the same log, and he wouldn't go and read a book, and what's the next stage?

1182
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:39,980
Let me find another piece of log that's more liquid than the solid, that no, it's within

1183
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:45,140
the same, there is more, so it's more on the level of the images, not more on the level

1184
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:51,940
of fantasizing about theory of linear connections between things that you already assume to

1185
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,940
be.

1186
01:01:52,940 --> 01:02:00,300
And in fact isn't each progressive stage more like the sort of negative of what?

1187
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:05,060
It is here, but that negative is also an outside thing.

1188
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:10,740
That's why there is, even in Putujan experience, there is the element of Nibbana present, which

1189
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:16,260
is why some people, some traditions, completely then jump to conclusions saying, ah so we

1190
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:21,620
are already Nibbana, because the Buddha said we all have element of Nibbana, we do.

1191
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:25,500
Element means present absence.

1192
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:33,260
So it's present as an absence, means it's possible to discern it, bring the context

1193
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:39,180
of it, develop the theme of it as the Buddha would say, and that's how you develop it.

1194
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:44,020
But saying that present absence means I'm already in that which is absent, because it's

1195
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:49,620
present as an absence, well that's jumping the gun.

1196
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:53,980
So there is the element of Nibbana in everyone's experience, yet the actual Nibbana, there

1197
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:58,720
is the presence of it in everyone's experience.

1198
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,420
And that's another good thing to reflect, because you stop assuming it to be at the

1199
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:06,380
end of the world, or at the end of your meditation, observational technique, it's already here.

1200
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:11,260
Every minute of your life, element of Nibbana is with you.

1201
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:19,940
Understand the theme of that element, understand the characteristics of that absence, there

1202
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:22,460
is Nibbana for you.

1203
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,540
I mean absence of greed, absence of aversion, absence of delusion.

1204
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:34,460
And it shares the qualities of all things we've been talking about, this kind of, yeah.

1205
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:39,900
So is there beyond when Saripurta asks, oh is there more than this, means exactly that,

1206
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:45,820
discerning it as a present absence, discerning it as a possibility to develop and develop.

1207
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:51,980
And then later on, as the Buddha says, he would develop it, oh yeah, he verified that

1208
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:56,660
there is more, there was more, now that present absent is not absent anymore, because he fully

1209
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,340
discerned the context of that which was absent.

1210
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:03,380
If there was not even present, even a tiny bit, as an absence, you couldn't go in that

1211
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:07,180
direction, how can you discern something that doesn't exist?

1212
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,580
Hence the element of Nibbana, you know the all the dhātras of the Buddha lists, it's

1213
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:16,060
not the physical elements scattered in the world that you collect like gems or something.

1214
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:22,500
It's basically the present absences, the absences of all the absence of dispassion, all these

1215
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,860
themes are present absences, all possibilities to develop in your practice are elements,

1216
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:32,380
as in the present as absences.

1217
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,620
But again, it has to be an image to that extent.

1218
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:40,780
Even if you complete Aṭha essential Putujana, Nibbana, Nibbana, what is Nibbana?

1219
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,740
You have some image, even if it's an image of a word.

1220
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,900
And that's what I mean, it closer then represents that ambiguous image, closer represents what

1221
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:54,180
Nibbana is in your experience than when you get to theorize what Nibbana is, because at

1222
01:04:54,180 --> 01:05:01,860
least you're looking in the direction of that absence that is present as such.

1223
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:08,820
That's why some monks needed very little detailed instruction, some monks needed more.

1224
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,420
With the minimum instruction they would have turned to the right direction of the right

1225
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,420
absence.

1226
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:20,580
And then dwell on it and understand the context of it and by doing so develop it.

1227
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:24,940
Even Jāna is the same principle, the word we say develop the theme of Jāna.

1228
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:30,700
Like Jāna is basically so close to the point of view that's why people, that's why it

1229
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,980
takes effort to attain it, to develop it.

1230
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,980
It's not like Jāna is figuring something out at the end of a certain effort.

1231
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:44,420
Jāna is basically the way you are seeing regarding things that you then got polluted

1232
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:47,140
with your own ignorance, with your own last aversion and habits.

1233
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:53,260
So it's removal of this pollution to basically recognize that certain imperturbable basis,

1234
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:54,260
unified basis.

1235
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:59,340
Well, whether I think about the sense object, whether I think about joy, grief, an image

1236
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:05,060
has to be there enduring and you become discerning of the enduring image regardless of the content

1237
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,300
of whatever points you.

1238
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:11,700
That's already a unified mind and that's already Jāna on account of any experience

1239
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,860
you can have.

1240
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:21,860
That's all those different ways of entering Jāna, the comment that is compiled from the

1241
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:26,500
suttas but like looking at the corpse established Jāna, mindfulness of the body established

1242
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,500
Jāna.

1243
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,500
So I'm like this results in Jāna.

1244
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:35,180
Jāna is an attitude of unification upon certain discernments, discernment of dispassion,

1245
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:42,180
discernment of sensuality, abandoning in that side so it's not the content, it's the

1246
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:58,380
theme, the nature of the image, the characteristics of the unified mind.

1247
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:03,420
So that's always, doesn't matter the experience, whether I'm feeling good, I'm feeling bad,

1248
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:12,620
I'm physical discomfort, physical comfort, whatever it is, doesn't matter how complex

1249
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:21,140
it is, how ambiguous it is, how content kind of inclined it is, image has to be there.

1250
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:28,700
Any idea of direction, any idea of the movement, two, four against both neither, requires an

1251
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:32,180
image to be there enduring, some ambiguous image.

1252
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:38,220
So it's recognizing, learning how to discern an image in its ambiguity, not try to replace

1253
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:46,380
it with content that you deemed a worthy threshold of it.

1254
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:51,060
Because how can you be exercising the threshold of necessary content unless there is an image

1255
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:53,020
that needs to be built up to that level?

1256
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:57,620
I just think it's about being skilled, I think it's about being skilled in images, which

1257
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:02,140
is being skilled in dhamma, being skilled in the mind, seeing the mind quickly.

1258
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,860
As soon as it arises, as soon as the image is manifested, he sees it exactly for what

1259
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,860
it is.

1260
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:12,740
He doesn't need to catch himself down the line and then, what, you will need that in

1261
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:13,740
the beginning.

1262
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,700
It's just like the word for image is dhamma.

1263
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,980
Sure, being skilled in dhamma, yeah.

1264
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:23,300
And that's why this teaching is the teaching, the dhamma, the image.

1265
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:29,700
The Buddha was teaching the image, the fundamental image, the universal image in common to any

1266
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:37,020
five aggregates, anywhere in the, any universe or realm, understanding the image.

1267
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:44,300
And that image is understanding the nature of images, the extent of images.

1268
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:50,220
Not the image extent in terms of telling you how many there are, the extent of the nature.

1269
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:54,980
So if he was talking about all these images, it's because it was the context of understanding

1270
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:55,980
the nature.

1271
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:03,540
The nature of images cannot be owned, cannot be appropriated, cannot be yours, cannot be

1272
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,540
controlled.

1273
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,500
You are the one subjected to them, not the other way around.

1274
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,500
You understand that?

1275
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:19,700
You are free from the entire samsara, all of it, absolutely, nothing left, samsara, universe,

1276
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,700
rebirth.

1277
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:25,100
Yeah, all these different directions, what they have in common, they are an image.

1278
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:31,900
Not this image, not that, specifically, maybe in biggers, but as such, an image is there.

1279
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:36,780
What else is there when I have these images, oh, it's always me, another image of me is

1280
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,100
always there.

1281
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,260
So that's kind of more in common to all these other things that you've been dwelling on.

1282
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:45,020
So why don't you dwell on something that's more in common to those particular things,

1283
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,740
as opposed to chasing down particular leads?

1284
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:53,420
And that's how inevitably you will end up to self-awareness, responsibility, point of

1285
01:09:53,420 --> 01:10:00,420
view, all these things we talk about.

1286
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:14,900
You don't have to go and have refined images, do you have to have refined images?

1287
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,460
They wouldn't be refined images.

1288
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,660
So even the...

1289
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:22,180
If you're refining your images, it means you're not seeing them as images.

1290
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:26,420
You're basically chasing the content, which is another image that you fail to see, hence

1291
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:31,340
the idea of refinement, of replacing it with another image of a different kind.

1292
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:34,060
Yeah, ambiguous images.

1293
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:40,940
The true refinement of an ambiguous image is to recognize its ambiguity to be an image.

1294
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,100
That's how you refine it.

1295
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:46,020
You don't refine it by providing content for it.

1296
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,620
That's likeologization, basically.

1297
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:51,420
Yeah, just now we were talking this whole idea of constant, every time you say constant,

1298
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,420
everything else?

1299
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:53,420
Meaningless.

1300
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:57,660
Well, if you want to establish your mind upon the unified image, then it's meaningless.

1301
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:04,300
Being distracted becomes inconceivable, meaningless.

1302
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:17,820
As in it's thesis, it's not there anymore.

1303
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:31,980
The mood is an image, has a color to it, has weight to it, that's why the Buddha described

1304
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:40,900
the Sadhipatana for Chitta, elated, expensive, shrunk, depressed, elated, big, small mind.

1305
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:44,180
Because yeah, those are images that mind is.

1306
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,180
That is what mind is.

1307
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:51,620
I'm thinking elation, no, it's like you discerning on the kind of mood, an image that's implicit

1308
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:55,620
in it, but you have nothing to do with it, you haven't created it.

1309
01:11:55,620 --> 01:12:00,620
You could not have created an image, impossible.

1310
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:04,500
I'm creating an image, is an image that you're subjected to and now you're trying to provide

1311
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:09,300
a secondary content to it that would feel more like yours, so you've begun with an image

1312
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:26,580
of the possibility of creating images.
