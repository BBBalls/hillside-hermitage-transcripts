00:00.000 --> 00:14.560
I have to read this because it's a short one, and how it does have become observed

00:14.560 --> 00:16.600
in moderation and eating.

00:16.600 --> 00:23.200
Here, reflecting carefully, the big group consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication

00:23.200 --> 00:28.080
nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance

00:28.080 --> 00:34.920
of this body, for avoiding harm and for assisting the spiritual life, considering, thus I shall

00:34.920 --> 00:39.500
terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, and I shall be healthy and

00:39.500 --> 00:41.320
blameless and throughout the ease.

00:41.320 --> 00:49.960
It is in this way that a bigger observed moderation and eating, and this, again, is the practice

00:49.960 --> 00:59.560
of the unmistakened way, which is the basic ground, for the destruction of the text.

00:59.560 --> 01:13.600
So, how does moderation and eating play part in this, play part in it?

01:13.600 --> 01:21.400
Exactly, but I was just saying, if you are transparent in regard to your motivation and intentions,

01:21.400 --> 01:28.560
so you make sure they are not rooted in sensuality, hence you would basically be contributing

01:28.560 --> 01:31.280
towards your sensory strength in general.

01:31.280 --> 01:37.400
However, food is necessary, it's not something you can just stop eating and say no to it.

01:37.400 --> 01:42.800
In the same sense, you can do that to a sexual intercourse or to other things, unnecessary

01:42.800 --> 01:45.760
things of central nature.

01:45.760 --> 01:50.480
So you have to eat food, but then food is also inseparable from the sense of taste, and

01:50.480 --> 01:54.920
obviously has a whole wide range of pleasures that revolve around food for people, which

01:54.920 --> 02:02.880
means it's quite likely going to be central, unless you make sure that your motivation is

02:02.880 --> 02:08.760
rooted in clear reflection and basically clarifying and developing new reasons as to why

02:08.760 --> 02:11.480
you are eating in the first place.

02:11.480 --> 02:15.880
So that's why you keep reminding yourself, again, not out of some sort of neurosis or

02:15.880 --> 02:17.880
something.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.240
If you don't remind yourself of the alternative reasons for eating, you will automatically

02:22.240 --> 02:27.480
be rooted in sensual reasons, enjoying the taste.

02:27.480 --> 02:33.520
But if you are rooted in proper reasons for eating, then no amount of refined central

02:33.520 --> 02:37.800
taste can actually make it central, because you remain wakeful and clear and you don't

02:37.800 --> 02:41.880
give in to any central intentions, for the duration of eating.

02:41.880 --> 02:47.160
So you're not chasing your moses of food and observing your tongue and whatnot, you're

02:47.160 --> 02:48.160
actually going the other way.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.560
You're going the way of having your intention rooted for the purpose of filling up the belly

02:52.560 --> 02:55.560
so I won't be hungry and will survive the next day.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.320
So the moment your belly starts feeling full, because that's what you keep at the back

02:58.320 --> 03:00.840
of your mind, you stop eating.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.200
And then if there is any any any any response in terms of your thoughts wanting more and

03:04.200 --> 03:07.800
stop them, that's obvious what it is, it's just craving, and you don't have to worry

03:07.800 --> 03:10.160
about it because you haven't been engaging with it.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
Dispaling of hunger.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.960
Yeah, that's the purpose of eating.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.600
But unless you keep that clear in your mind and often remind yourself, you will be

03:18.600 --> 03:20.400
back onto the sensual reasons.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.920
So that's what we like you maintain, the transparency of your intentions, because when

03:23.920 --> 03:27.640
you have intention to eat, for as long as you're eating, that same intention is present

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
there.

03:28.640 --> 03:33.920
So you just want to make sure it doesn't shift into like onto different roots.

03:33.920 --> 03:39.240
It doesn't sort of get moves away from the reasons of like intended reason of eating for

03:39.240 --> 03:45.840
just dispelling hunger and moves away onto enjoying this particular taste.

03:45.840 --> 03:50.640
So that's how you also mind remains above the taste, not through denying or not tasting

03:50.640 --> 03:57.040
it, but simply through not giving in to last version delusion on account of it.

03:57.040 --> 04:06.960
And no amount of lovely, nice, agreeable tastes could overwhelm the mind of the mind.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.840
Some days you need to eat more.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.840
Exactly.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.080
Some days you have to eat much more and your belly was still going full, feel like, well,

04:14.080 --> 04:15.080
the hunger is gone.

04:15.080 --> 04:19.920
So that's why there's no again, there's no method or technique or something of description

04:19.920 --> 04:24.800
or recipe, eat this much every time though, you don't know.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.040
But that's not the point.

04:26.040 --> 04:30.920
The food was never the problem, it was your desire and lust in regard to it.

04:30.920 --> 04:38.000
So you start approaching that by not having those intentions of eating rooted in that

04:38.000 --> 04:42.080
sensuality, but other reasons for it.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.840
Because you can't go either way, like you cannot, you cannot have like a sexual intercourse

04:45.840 --> 04:50.880
for example rooted in all some reasons, that's just too obvious.

04:50.880 --> 04:57.240
But things like eating food and drinking, yeah, they can go either way, they can be wholesome

04:57.240 --> 04:58.240
or unwholesome.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
Drinking water.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.320
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

05:03.320 --> 05:04.320
that's not negotiable, yeah.

05:04.320 --> 05:09.120
I mean drinking water or whatever, I don't know, fruit juice or tea or coffee or things

05:09.120 --> 05:10.120
like that.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.120
Yeah.

05:11.120 --> 05:15.120
And what about fasting?

05:15.120 --> 05:20.680
Well, again, if done for right reasons, it can make this whole picture and relationship

05:20.680 --> 05:28.320
between the last founded upon sensuality or, sorry, intentions founded upon last sensuality

05:28.320 --> 05:32.200
or nonlast, non-sensuality, it can make that whole relationship clear.

05:32.200 --> 05:37.960
But if you do, if you just fast mechanically, if you took it as some external determination,

05:37.960 --> 05:39.360
no wisdom arise from it.

05:39.360 --> 05:43.480
That's where self-mortification won't arise, won't reveal the middle way in terms of

05:43.480 --> 05:47.240
you won't lead to liberation, nor indulge as well.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.560
That's why the Buddha would say, let those who want to go and live on one meal and sit

05:50.560 --> 05:54.760
under the root of a tree do it, let those who don't want to, wanting and don't want

05:54.760 --> 06:00.040
to means knowing whether it's good for you or not, doesn't mean like, oh, great, so

06:00.040 --> 06:01.280
I don't need to go out.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.280
Well, maybe you should actually.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.280
See, let those with divine view, those in different ways.

06:07.280 --> 06:13.800
Pretty much, let those who know what makes their non-existent lust, what prevents non-existent

06:13.800 --> 06:18.720
lust from manifesting, and what makes the existence lust disappearing.

06:18.720 --> 06:24.360
Let those either go on the root of sure not, or eat one meal a day, or separate it, or

06:24.360 --> 06:49.360
separate it out to you.
