1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Go. If you are seeing things in the right way, then something that you know is unskilledful,

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:33,000
say lust comes up, and there is a red flag or you can feel the tendency there or the pressure there,

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but you don't, but then the mind goes into that, just investigating it, just naturally like,

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
okay, now go a red flag, this is unskilledful, why is it unskilledful?

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The dominant start falling, why is it unskilled? Because in a classroom, you're not getting wisdom out of this,

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it's not peaceful, it's agitated, it's the problem, where is it based on the body,

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that body over there, it's not mind, with that view of that situation,

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:27,000
while that situation, it's not like if lust comes up, that is automatically a problem.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, because you're not free from it, so because you're not free from it, you have to be doing all of which you just described,

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
because you're not free from the nature of lust, because you're still subject, or you're still liable to lust,

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
it means all those things, now it's sort of going in the right direction, but it's still not there,

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
because when I say going in the right direction, I mean, yeah, so you're trying to understand the nature of lust,

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:16,000
so to prevent the future arising, because as I said, the problem is much deeper than just one particular arising of one particular lust,

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
or whatever, the problem is that it is able to arise, means lust remains possible,

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and you're not free from the possibility of your mind being infected by lust, or by aversion, or whatever,

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so that's what you need to strive at, so when the lust arises, if there is a pool, or if the angle arises,

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
if there is an aversion, or whatever you want to call it, that's a problem,

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
so that's already a problem, the fact that that possibility of anger, and now the actual anger, affects you,

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
so whatever you do then, will be an account of that lust, will be an account of that anger,

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
so that's already not good, fundamentally speaking, but it's still within that of, it's not ideal,

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
since you cannot but not do anything, because you're not free from the nature of it, you're not free from the nature of lust,

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so you will end up whatever you do, will be because of the reason of lust,

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
so then the best, and that's what you can do, is aim that whatever you have no choice but to do,

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
is aim that undoing the nature of the lust, so restraint, reflection that undermines the nature of lust and so on,

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
so yes, that's a form of response, which means, and if you need to respond, means you're affected,

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
so as I said, for a protrusion, or in the case of the creation of you, or that's not a snake, that's a rope,

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
well, you have to go and find out it's a rope, that's completely misdirected, that's directed outside, projected onto the thing,

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
so if, and there is a natural tendency, like if there is a lustful object causing, like,

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
infecting your mind with lust, you're trying to find the fault in the object, or find the fault in the object that causes you the anger and stuff,

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and that's already misplaced, so you have to be able to accept it, accept responsibility for it,

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
means we stand at a rising, for as long as he wants to rise, which I wait, he wants to rise,

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and then, you have to think carefully, and wisely basically make that whatever you do,

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
won't be misdirected at the particular thing, or internally or externally, or both tonight,

34
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,000
you won't be thinking about, like, feeling bad about you, or hating on the object, or hating on yourself,

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
whatever, you want to do, a type of reflection that will end at that possibility of lust, of a version of delusion,

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
of the fact that you are still subject to it, whether the present arise and just reminded you of that, then you're still subject to it,

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
but when you start dealing with it, you want to develop your effort, so to speak,

38
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that they transcend the particular concern about this lustful object, or that hateful object,

39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
but start dealing with the nature of lust and nature of hate, and it's extra hard in the beginning,

40
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
because the mind is pulled by the object, and the problem means the object, but actually it's not,

41
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
that's why delusion is a habit that's been cultivated for so long, so now the assumption that what has arisen now,

42
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
what bothers me, whether in, by causing lust or aversion, that's the problem, I need to deal with it,

43
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and you feel immediate satisfaction, because you dealt with it, one way or the other,

44
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and you gave in or overcome, and that's still misplaced, but the more you look at it,

45
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the more that becomes obvious, that actually, yeah, I might be able to deal with this particular problem,

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
with this particular arising, with a particular thing that I just perceived, but what if I can't?

47
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Or, more likely, and everybody experienced that, yeah, I could deal with it, and I dealt with it, and then what, until the next one comes along,

48
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and then the next one, and then the next one, and then the next one.

49
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I know, yeah, and I would not deal with something like that.

50
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I would dealt with it completely, and it's like, oh, okay, I've already done so much.

51
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So that type of escape, it's not really an escape, you don't want to have to do anything,

52
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
so as I said, in that Hindu Christian example of, oh, you have fear arising on a kind of snake that you just seen,

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
that's it.

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now they say, ah, but then you look closer, and then turns out it's a rope,

55
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
therefore your fear was not real, that's completely misdirected,

56
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
because what if you can't look closer, or what if you look even closer, and you find out it's a snake?

57
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That looks like a rope.

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't want to have to do anything on a kind of thing,

59
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because that means, well, it's good or bad, you're affected by that thing.

60
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If you need to respond to it, if you need to find out that the rope, that that snake is a rope,

61
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
means you were affected by the nature of the arising of a thing.

62
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So once you start thinking like that, whether you see a snake or a rope,

63
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
there's a matter.

64
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You see, I think fear arose, that's the problem, that's what you deal with it,

65
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and you're not concerned to go and look closer to see if it's a rope,

66
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because ah, yeah, good, then my fear is not real.

67
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That particular fear turned out to be unfounded,

68
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but finding out it's unfounded, it's a different experience from the original fear.

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So even if it was the actual rope, the two thought it was a snake,

70
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it was a real experience as such.

71
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It was experience of something I think is a snake that turns out actually to be a rope

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
that is frightening me.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So that's why that doesn't work, and that's why psychology doesn't work either,

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
in terms of freedom from suffering.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It always requires this management response in regard to things that arise and both of you.

76
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And again, you just stop and think about it, yeah, I might be able to deal with this,

77
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but now I am able to walk and find out that it's a rope.

78
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But what if I can't do it?

79
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then I remain affected by this fear that might be unfounded or not,

80
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
but either way, it is real as such, because you can say, oh, it's not real,

81
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
the fear is not real, because that might be a rope.

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can say even that, but even then, in that case,

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the experience of unreal fear is still frightening.

84
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So where do you label it real, or unreal, or both, or neither?

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The fact that on the level of feelings there is suffering, that's the problem.

86
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So it requires a magical belief that unreal frees me from suffering.

87
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The only connection between the two is the ignorance,

88
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
not knowing that actually your suffering remains unaffected.

89
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And that's how it works.

90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You see as something a snake, whatever arises,

91
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there is always an implicit possibility of it being otherwise.

92
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And that's just the nature of things.

93
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So in the same way, oh, I saw a snake, fear arose.

94
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you don't misplace the problem, if you don't project it out onto that thing

95
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
that you just perceived, if you just take it as a reminder that

96
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
you can still be frightened, means you're not free from the nature of fear,

97
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
regardless of any particular manifestation of it, an object that manifests it,

98
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
then if you find out one way or the other, that it's a rope,

99
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
then that experience of the rope is the experience of the rope

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that I thought it was that snake.

101
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So there is a relief on the particular level,

102
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
but if you look at it as an nature thing, it means,

103
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
next time it might actually be a snake.

104
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The next time I might see a rope, that I think it's a rope and I'm not afraid,

105
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
then I come closer and I realize it's a snake.

106
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So how does then, like this interpretation of Christian stack up,

107
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
saying, oh, well, see, it was a rope.

108
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Therefore, your fear and your whole experience is an illusion,

109
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
there's nothing to be afraid of.

110
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, what if it's either way around?

111
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What if you think it's a rope, but then it's a snake,

112
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
because there are snakes in the world, then what?

113
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then you hold on.

114
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now this illusion, you can still call it an illusion,

115
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
but it doesn't reduce your fear anyway.

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Because you can say, oh, crap.

117
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The experience of non-threatening things

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
can be threatening if I find out closer.

119
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So your reverse completely,

120
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but that's why you need a belief and blind belief,

121
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
whereby you only look selectively at the things that suit you.

122
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because in reality, actually,

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the letter belief is more closer to the nature of things,

124
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
whereby you think that everything can be a snake.

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Why? Because an arising of things, in general,

126
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
upon which your existence depends,

127
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and is defined by, will see, eventually, death.

128
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So rather than like, oh, no, it's all illusion, I'm fine.

129
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You can undo it and say, well,

130
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
even the pleasure that I'm experiencing here,

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
or even the peace that I'm experiencing here,

132
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
in that sense, you can say, it's illusory,

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
because it will come to an end.

134
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But then you realize that's not the illusion they talk about.

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They talk about the illusion selectively,

136
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
denying its existence,

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
because that temporarily, momentarily,

138
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
frees you from fear.

139
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But even if there is a mistake,

140
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
like if you're perceiving something that is not like that,

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
that experience of a mistake,

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
experience of illusion is real as such.

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And it's irrelevant,

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
in a sense, because whether it's real or illusory,

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the fact that it can make you feel,

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
that's where the problem is.

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Feeling is the problem,

148
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
not what you've just perceived or not.

149
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So just thinking of that becomes apparent that,

150
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
well, thinking of that,

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
will make the attitude of denial saying,

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
oh, the world, the experience, this is not real,

153
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
this is not real.

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It will make it basically hollow,

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
impotent.

156
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, it's leaking here.

157
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It will make it impotent,

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
because it works only if you don't look at the other side of the picture.

159
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's not real, it's the denial,

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that frees you from temporarily,

161
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
well, seemingly frees you from,

162
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
oh, I'm relieved now, it was actually a rope.

163
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But as I said, if you reverse,

164
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and then don't stop this,

165
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah?

166
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Denire your rope.

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Denire your snake by finding out it's a rope.

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Now, deny that rope.

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Denire that piece as well.

170
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why do you stop there?

171
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If you only go to deny this pleasure,

172
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
as a former escape,

173
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
well, why do you,

174
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
like you can't in good faith,

175
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
then don't deny peace.

176
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So I'm relieved of what if it's a snake.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And it just shows you that things are subject to change,

178
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
even if they don't necessarily change.

179
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And then you realize,

180
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I cannot control.

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Things changing.

182
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Thus, the peace I feel now

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
on account of this particular change

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
is out of my control too.

185
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And that's frightening.

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But then at the same time,

187
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
the suffering that I feel on account of these things right now

188
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
is also out of my control.

189
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And that's liberating.

190
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So now you want to bend in both.

191
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You want to realize that, well, actually,

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
it's irrelevant.

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Whether it's, I think,

194
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
it's real or not real.

195
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The fact is, it arises as such.

196
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And as such, my feelings depend upon it.

197
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And as such, I have no control over them.

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And that's why Arhan doesn't feel pleasure.

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No, this pleasure.

200
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's not subject to, you know,

201
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to, like, delight and lustful excitement

202
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and that form of pleasure.

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, he's subject to suffering.

204
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Because both are seen as dependent upon

205
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
things that arise externally.

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And as such, something that is

207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
fundamentally beyond your control.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He's seen the day you change the result.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's it.

210
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The danger, the gratification and the escape.

211
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The gratification being just basic.

212
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Sorry?

213
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The gratification being of things arise.

214
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, there is a degree of pleasure.

215
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So gratification is confirmation and delight

216
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and rejoicing in that pleasure.

217
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But you have to start seeing that pleasure,

218
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
whether you're gratified or not,

219
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
as impermanent, as lonely,

220
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
unworthy and attractive.

221
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because, hey, look, they're similar from the suitors.

222
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They're a big cup of beautiful beverage

223
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
pleasing in every sense.

224
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So, they smell nice,

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
nice, nice, nice,

226
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
resistance in everything.

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Nice taste.

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Now, it looks beautiful,

229
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
but it has poison in it.

230
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You cannot detect,

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but you know that there is a poison.

232
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So, that's still there.

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's not real.

234
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And the joy of drinking,

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
of experiencing that taste,

236
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
is also real.

237
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you don't know that it has poison,

238
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
you'll drink it and you'll enjoy it.

239
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
If you know that it has poison,

240
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
well, you'll drink it,

241
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and your mouth will still enjoy it.

242
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But you won't enjoy it,

243
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
because it will be overpopulated or overloaded.

244
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Overrided.

245
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Overrided.

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It will be overridden.

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, it will be overwhelmed

248
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
by the fear of the knowledge

249
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that actually you are drinking poison.

250
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So, you won't drink it.

251
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No matter how pleasing it is,

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
fully discerning the danger,

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
the poison in it,

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
you will not give in to the gratification of it.

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So, there is no...

256
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's why,

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
you mustn't deny things,

258
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
even beautiful and chanting things,

259
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
because by denying them,

260
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the natural gratification is being denied,

261
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and you're not understanding it,

262
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
which means you're still trying to buy it.

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So, obviously, that's when you should indulge.

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I mean, like, no,

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
that means going to drink poison, no.

266
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You have to refrain from drinking poison,

267
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but you have to recognize

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that the validity of its pleasure

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
still stands on certain level,

270
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
on the level of taste,

271
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
on the level of sight,

272
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
on the level of smell, touch, ears.

273
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
On that level,

274
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it remains,

275
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
but you can discern through that,

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and then the knowledge,

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
because that knowledge cannot be perceived.

278
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Poison is undetectable.

279
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So, the whole idea of Krishna

280
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
escape, of denial,

281
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
my illusion reality,

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
just doesn't work,

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
because there are certain things

284
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
that have only been known,

285
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
not perceived.

286
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So, you can go and see that the rope is a snake,

287
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and the snake is a rope or whatever.

288
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Or you can do a scientific experiment,

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and find out that it has traces

290
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
of what if it's undetectable

291
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
by any means,

292
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
you can approach it through your senses.

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When the only thing you have is a thought,

294
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
that there is a poison in it,

295
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
which is why it's so hard to develop.

296
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But if it is developed,

297
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
no amount of pleasure coming from the five senses

298
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
can actually take you back there,

299
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
because the knowledge is developed

300
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
on a more fundamental level,

301
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
that precedes the senses

302
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
in that structural sense.

303
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So, they just,

304
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
they're powerless then.

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If you know that there is a poison,

306
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
if you calculate that thought enough,

307
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
obviously, if there weren't no poison in centrality,

308
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
no matter how much you think that there is a poison,

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
it would not get established.

310
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But because in reality,

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
there is a poison in centrality,

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
thinking that there is a poison

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
will eventually yield the result

314
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
of you recognizing that poison in a knowledge,

315
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
which is how the dama works.

316
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If the things that the Buddha taught about

317
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
were not actually already there in those things,

318
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you thinking of things

319
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
will not be able to take root,

320
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
which means I don't think you will not be possible.

321
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But because those things are there,

322
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
thinking according to the way that those things are,

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
will eventually make you recognize

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that those things are there.

325
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But it takes time, which is why

326
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
the repetition is necessary for practice.

327
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's not you see it once,

328
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
like you move the curtains

329
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and you see what's outside.

330
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No. You need to keep doing it,

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and doing it, and doing it,

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
until that almost,

333
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
that artificial view of looking for poison

334
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
that you don't see, you don't detect nothing.

335
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Get so established,

336
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and when it's established,

337
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
then you will actually see the poison,

338
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
see the danger.

339
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And because that danger was truly there,

340
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
your practice corresponded to it,

341
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
even without your knowledge,

342
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and then it got confirmed,

343
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and now you know.

344
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And that's what that was the same.

345
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's like transition from puttuja

346
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
into a saltabana.

347
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He doesn't know in the beginning,

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but he's doing it,

349
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and looking at things correctly,

350
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
according to the nature of things,

351
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
he doesn't know.

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So there is that faith,

353
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
as the first step necessary,

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
that he had to take on something,

355
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
he doesn't know if it's right,

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
even the Buddha's teaching,

357
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and then he kept doing it,

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
doing it, doing it,

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and because it was right,

360
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
because it was how things were,

361
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
then that becomes apparent eventually,

362
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and then it's confirmed from him,

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
so he doesn't need any more faith.

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Now he sees directly for himself

365
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
that those things are there.

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Which is why you have the

367
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
centralities, one of the types of,

368
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
one of the assumptions,

369
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
one of the opadanas.

370
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's exactly how it works.

371
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You just assume something based on not knowing,

372
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
but then you have no reference to know.

373
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So you have to accept and trust

374
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
that there is a poison in centrality.

375
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And then whenever there is a pleasure

376
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
or pull or enchantment or delight,

377
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
you keep like pasting the idea

378
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
of poison over it.

379
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So it's artificial,

380
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
because you're not seeing it.

381
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But because it is actually there,

382
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and you have faith that it's actually there,

383
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
it will sort of take its roots,

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
much like when you graft a plant,

385
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
you bring a completely alien different plant,

386
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
different tree, different branch to this tree.

387
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And you graft it.

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And then it takes over,

389
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and then it merges and becomes a new tree.

390
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's how you actually have to take the view externally,

391
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
which is why an utterance of another is necessary.

392
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And obviously knowing how to apply it.

393
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And that's why we refer to the darkness,

394
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
the ancient part,

395
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
that was already there just gets obscured.

396
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If it weren't, no monografting can take root,

397
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
because it doesn't correspond to it.

398
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And that's why it's necessary

399
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
for a Buddha or somebody of that standard,

400
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
so to speak, to rise in the world,

401
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
because it's not enough to see it once.

402
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Like you might want to think that there is a poison

403
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
that centrality is unwanted.

404
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But unless you have faith,

405
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
unless somebody told you that you have to keep seeing that

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
over and over and over again,

407
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you won't do it.

408
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Which means that the true nature of

409
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
poison and the danger of sensuality

410
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
will not be discerned.

411
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because it's not enough to do it once,

412
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
which means you can't do the dharma by accident,

413
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
or by luck, or by sheer chance.

414
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Or by sheer chance,

415
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I realize that there is a poisonous sensuality.

416
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Because it's undetectable.

417
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So basically that knowledge,

418
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
or there might be a poison,

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
even if you don't see it.

420
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's the most you're going to get,

421
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
a possibility, but even then.

422
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So that's why someone's pathogen

423
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
can't free themselves from sensuality.

424
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There is a possibility of this beautiful

425
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
tasty beverage being poisonous,

426
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
as a similar.

427
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So there is always that possibility.

428
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But unless you have a good reason

429
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
to entertain the possibility,

430
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and act according to it,

431
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
you won't do it.

432
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Because it just seems unreal,

433
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
actually.

434
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Seems face, seems artificial,

435
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
seems imaginary,

436
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
because it is on that level.

437
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But if you keep doing it,

438
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
turns out there was a poison

439
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and now you're liberated from it.

440
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So you can't have pathogens

441
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
free from sensuality.

442
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So it's the same principle

443
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
like that when it comes to self-view.

444
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But you can't do that by yourself,

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
because it's yourself doing it.

446
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So you have to take on something completely externally

447
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
by somebody who already done it

448
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and then keep doing it.

449
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And then eventually,

450
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
it will correspond to the nature of things,

451
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
which is that nothing can be yourself.

452
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So it's the same principle

453
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
of it's undetectable,

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
because your whole experience is about yourself.

455
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Someone says, well, it's not self.

456
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So you can hear, oh, okay,

457
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
there's no self.

458
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
There's no self.

459
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But then there's no self.

460
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's the experience of yourself.

461
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So you have to discern

462
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
the lack of self

463
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
in the reason things.

464
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But you can't perceive,

465
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
you can't see it,

466
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
you can discern it.

467
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So the mind comes first

468
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and all the senses meet in the mind,

469
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and so on.

470
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Which is why again,

471
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
the common contemporary interpretation

472
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
of impermanence

473
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
as a flux and things changing

474
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and the modern science has proven

475
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
that nothing is permanent

476
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
because the atoms are like,

477
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
that's all based on perception.

478
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And the starch makes no difference.

479
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah, I can say this chair is unreal,

480
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but if I'm personal,

481
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I attach to that chair.

482
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And even if I know

483
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
it's unreal,

484
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you're breaking it.

485
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'll suffer.

486
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I've got my attachment.

487
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
How many of you say it's not real?

488
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I've seen things externally.

489
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's whether it's real or not real

490
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
or moving or not.

491
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
As such, it is real.

492
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The fact that it has a reason

493
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
means it's real.

494
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Oh, that's just delusion.

495
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Delusion is real.

496
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So the type of the danger

497
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
of the escape with the gratification

498
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and the escape is something

499
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
you cannot perceive through your senses.

500
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So saying that all the objects

501
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
are impermanent,

502
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
oh, this is all changing constantly.

503
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That makes no difference.

504
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Because as such,

505
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
as changing constantly,

506
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
it's real.

507
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And as such,

508
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
you're not free from the nature

509
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:58,000
of the rising.

510
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah, nature is not impermanence.

511
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah.

512
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And nature is basically

513
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
the impermanence

514
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
in terms of,

515
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
well, things that think

516
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I think is impermanent

517
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
because it has a reason.

518
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Not because you witnessed its cessation.

519
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Whatever has the nature of a rising

520
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
for that reason

521
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
is subject to nature's ceasing,

522
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
even if it's still persisting

523
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
right in front of you.

524
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because depending on something

525
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
that I have no control of.

526
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, yeah.

527
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, that's something

528
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
that becomes apparent

529
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
if you're still looking

530
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
at the manifestation of things.

531
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And when I say manifest,

532
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I don't mean like

533
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
seeing things through your senses

534
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
or something.

535
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I mean them manifesting

536
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
as phenomena,

537
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
which is sometimes through a sense

538
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
through a sense,

539
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
sometimes through a mind.

540
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So even the biggest

541
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
weird delusional thoughts

542
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
are really such.

543
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You can designate them,

544
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
you can talk about them.

545
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You cannot perceive them

546
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
by your five senses,

547
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
but you can perceive them

548
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
by your mind.

549
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They're there.

550
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So that's all real.

551
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So you have to acknowledge that

552
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and then it becomes apparent

553
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
that whatever has the nature of a rising

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
is out of your control.

555
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like you have no say.

556
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well, actually,

557
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
you have no access

558
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
to the point that they are rising

559
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
from where they are rising.

560
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
They're just there.

561
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You just find them already there.

562
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So even if you're just witnessing

563
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
something appearing,

564
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
when that thing appears,

565
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
appears as if

566
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
it's there beforehand.

567
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Simultaneous.

568
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Not necessarily time-involving time.

569
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Or yes, this can be asked to know.

570
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Simultaneous appears

571
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
as something before.

572
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So for that reason,

573
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
you realize the roots,

574
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
the foundations of that thing

575
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
are inconceivable,

576
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
inaccessible to you.

577
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And that's what impermanence is.

578
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Even if that thing remains standing

579
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
for the rest of your life,

580
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
which is actually your body,

581
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
you can't let everybody disappear

582
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and get destroyed

583
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and you still remain standing.

584
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And things are around these

585
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
because, well,

586
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
it's possible for them to run

587
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
because consciousness.

588
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, yes.

589
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
See, but even that.

590
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There has to be consciousness.

591
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You can't see that directly.

592
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You can explain that.

593
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because the consciousness.

594
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But then you're conceiving that consciousness

595
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
as the cause of the rising of the things.

596
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That's you're conceiving it as yourself.

597
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You're enclosed within the five aggregates

598
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and they're manifested.

599
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
For the reason they're manifested,

600
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
they are impermanent.

601
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Is enclosed within the five aggregates.

602
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah.

603
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You can't step outside of them.

604
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So you can't say consciousness.

605
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Is this consciousness? Is that?

606
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Well, you can't do that.

607
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's because you can't face.

608
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes.

609
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But you can...

610
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well, no.

611
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
In terms of all of the aggregates.

612
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You cannot own them.

613
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You can just...

614
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You can describe it.

615
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Well, yes, but your description is such.

616
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Appropriate to them.

617
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Saying consciousness is the reason for this.

618
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You're just appropriated it.

619
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So I can't say it arises

620
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
like this particular thing.

621
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Whatever it is.

622
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
My hand arises within consciousness.

623
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Within the...

624
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Self-consciousness. No.

625
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
No.

626
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Because that would mean like consciousness

627
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
is some sort of vessel.

628
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And which things appear.

629
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Which means you take the ownership of the vessel.

630
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But arises with consciousness.

631
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Well, within your whole experience

632
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
is within the five aggregates and closed.

633
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So when you have the experience of my hand

634
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
as a reason,

635
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
the experience of having a hand

636
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
that is realizing in your experience

637
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
is within already.

638
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You can't step outside of it.

639
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And saying that arises

640
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
inside of the consciousness

641
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
or inside of this means stepping...

642
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
means putting it into something.

643
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Which means you adapt.

644
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Which is outside.

645
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You become the vessel

646
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
in which things arise.

647
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Therefore you become its owner.

648
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
No.

649
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Whatever the aggregate is manifested.

650
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's found there beforehand.

651
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Seal teniously is manifestation.

652
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So whether it's a perception of your hand

653
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
or your feeling

654
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
or just the knowledge of something

655
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
means

656
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
it's manifested.

657
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And you have no say in that manifestation.

658
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You have no say.

659
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Absolutely no say.

660
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
They arise on their own accord.

661
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
They persist on their own accord.

662
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And that's within that.

663
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's why they're impermanent.

664
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So again,

665
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
witnessing something disappear

666
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
means taking an external view

667
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
in regard to their disappearance.

668
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And as such,

669
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
their disappearance will not pertain to a

670
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
a Nietzsche,

671
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
which is the personal impermanence.

672
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The impermanence that frees you from suffering.

673
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Well, because you're just with witness

674
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
to the external,

675
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
which means that which was witnessing

676
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and it remained unaffected by it.

677
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But if you recognize,

678
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
well, it's not because

679
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
cessation of things

680
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
is something that's manifested.

681
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And as such,

682
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
it's impermanent

683
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
because it's manifested,

684
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
not because it's ceasing.

685
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So rising is manifested.

686
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Cessation is manifested.

687
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Persisting while changing is manifested.

688
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
All of those things are impermanent.

689
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Impermanence is in regard to all of them.

690
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Not just bound with cessation.

691
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Well, the dead nature of impermanence

692
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
is superimposed to any of those

693
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
particular manifestations of it.

694
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's on a different level.

695
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Simultaneous to present,

696
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
inseparable from,

697
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
but on a different level.

698
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It pertains to the nature of things.

699
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:11,000
A rising, the nature of arising,

700
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
the nature of ceasing,

701
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
the nature of persisting while changing.

702
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Well, the three things have come.

703
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
They have a nature.

704
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
A nature.

705
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That nature is manifested

706
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and as such,

707
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
it's impermanent for the reason

708
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
that it's manifested.

709
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If you were able to be a creator,

710
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
if you were able to be a creator,

711
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
you would be able to take the possession

712
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
of cessation, that thing,

713
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
which means you can have it as long as you want,

714
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
but you can't.

715
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You can't even conceive,

716
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
you can't even access the point

717
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
where things manifest.

718
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You just find them as manifested,

719
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
even if it's simultaneously right now.

720
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And as such,

721
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
when they cease,

722
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
that's also inaccessible to you.

723
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Which is why the aggregates cannot be actually assumed

724
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
in the first place.

725
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
They cannot be held by up and down in the first place.

726
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
We can't take them up.

727
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Not knowing that you can't take them up,

728
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
that's how you take it up.

729
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So again, arising is manifested.

730
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Ceasing is manifested.

731
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Resisting while changing is manifested.

732
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Manifestation is that,

733
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
which is impermanent.

734
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Not those particular lines,

735
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:52,000
not those particular lines,
