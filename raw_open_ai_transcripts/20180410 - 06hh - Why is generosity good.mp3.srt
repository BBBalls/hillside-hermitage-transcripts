1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,380
So it's only about the generosity of the day.

2
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:35,380
So how is generosity hosting?

3
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,380
Why is it good?

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,380
Just in general.

5
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,380
What's the point of generosity?

6
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,380
What makes generosity good?

7
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,380
Why is it hosting in itself, basically?

8
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:04,380
Well, on a most fundamental level, it is hosting because it involves...

9
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,380
It's founded, even if a person is not aware of it, the act of generosity

10
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:19,380
basically has its core in the act of non-self-centeredness or selfishness or non-selfishness.

11
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,380
When you say, when you use a word selfish, people already have notions about selfish and non-selfish.

12
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:33,380
And even if you're non-selfish, you're doing it as your sort of decision and choice.

13
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:41,380
So it's being selfish or not selfish, it's not on that fundamental level that I'm referring to here.

14
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:48,380
It's kind of secondary to it because people can selfishly engage in acts of not selfishness.

15
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,380
But what I'm talking about is a pure nature of the act of generosity.

16
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,380
If you sort of look at it in its own context,

17
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,380
it is founded upon non-selfishness of a genuine kind.

18
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,380
It doesn't revolve around self-centeredness.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,380
So that's why generosity is good, even for people who are selfish.

20
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,380
Even for people who do it for selfish reasons.

21
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,380
People can be generous for selfish reasons, but still that does not cancel out the act of generosity,

22
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
which is the act of non-selfishness.

23
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Sure, on a more general level, their selfishness has taken possession of that non-selfish generosity,

24
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,380
but in itself, it still counts.

25
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,380
Obviously, it's better to not be selfish on any level.

26
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,380
So that's why generosity in itself is good.

27
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,380
That's the sole reason.

28
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,380
Now why is generosity in on selfish? Well, that's just the nature of things.

29
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,380
So generosity in itself, you could then, based on what I said,

30
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,380
you could see that generosity in itself, it's not that fundamental.

31
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Generosity in self is good because it contains the fundamental principle of non-selfishness.

32
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,380
So if you can tap into the fundamental principle of non-selfishness,

33
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,380
you don't have to be generous, because you will neither be generous nor generous.

34
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,380
You'll go beyond selfishness, even if you don't give anything to anyone for the rest of your life.

35
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,380
But it's just people who don't reach those levels of development of their mind,

36
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,380
that kind of freedom, for them it's good to even just emulate selfishness.

37
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,380
Sorry, emulate generosity, which would then emulate, which would then contain acts of non-selfishness.

38
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,380
They are not aware of it, to what extent or whatever, but in itself, it still counts.

39
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:49,380
It still matters. So basically, one should be actively sort of engaged in generosity,

40
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,380
if he has means and ability to do so and so on, but should not make a practice out of it,

41
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,380
because it's only like a second best, like if you can't really commit to the practice

42
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:07,380
and really develop your mind directly without any intermediary, which would be the acts of generosity.

43
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,380
Then, yeah, if you can't do those things more directly, then focus on generosity.

44
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,380
Oh, if you're not sure if you're doing those things right or not, keep doing generosity just in case.

45
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,380
Be generous, be helpful, and that's it.

46
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,380
Well, I guess another thing you could add is that, yeah, a person should try and do it selflessly,

47
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,380
but an unlikely person had no choice but being selfish, whatever he'd do,

48
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,380
whatever he does it because he wants to do it, he has a desire to do so, which means he's acting selfishly always.

49
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,380
But then you have selfishness that will then perpetuate and bring more selfishness,

50
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,380
and then you have selfishness that can then bring more generosity.

51
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,380
So you want to cultivate that kind of selfishness.

52
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,380
That's where the Buddha, for example, would encourage people,

53
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,380
actively think about benefits of giving, because you'll be reborn in heaven and so on.

54
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Yeah, want it and do it. Doesn't matter. Yeah, it's not super like 100% pure.

55
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,380
But for where they're at, it's good.
