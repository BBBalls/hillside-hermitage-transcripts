00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:31.000 --> 00:38.760
So what do you think about the thoughts that having pets increases one's attachments in the world

00:42.680 --> 00:44.680
Well the brief answer it's

00:46.560 --> 00:49.120
Things in the world are not your attachment

00:49.840 --> 00:52.280
It's your attitude towards the things in the world

00:53.440 --> 00:55.440
The same sense the Buddha said

00:55.440 --> 01:02.800
Beautiful things in the world are not are not man's centralities desire and lust towards those things that sensuality is there

01:04.360 --> 01:08.440
So people blaming things for their attachment means people

01:09.160 --> 01:14.120
Not seeing where their attachment is so as long as you blame things for attachment you're gonna be attached

01:15.200 --> 01:22.160
Because the most natural responses when people think I must give up the attachment is to throw away all my possessions and get rid of everything

01:22.160 --> 01:27.240
But that's not freeing you from attachment. That's just obscuring your attitude that you had towards those things

01:27.240 --> 01:32.240
Which means when something else comes your way you're gonna be able to attach to it because you have an undermine that

01:33.040 --> 01:35.520
a mental stance of appropriation

01:39.000 --> 01:44.640
So in terms of pets or family members parents like

01:44.640 --> 01:55.080
Your attachment is your emotional dependence upon those things being present in the world not those things in the world

01:55.760 --> 02:01.120
Because if truly you would need to get rid of the stuff to be free from attachment means you need to go and destroy the whole world

02:01.120 --> 02:14.240
To be free from attachment to the world, but that's not how it works

02:14.240 --> 02:17.920
There are some some things some relationships

02:19.120 --> 02:23.720
Not worthy of having some relationships. Yeah. Yeah. Well sensuality in general

02:23.720 --> 02:31.880
So like if you if you want to have pets in this particular example you well before you do ask yourself why

02:32.880 --> 02:36.120
Are you are you having pets because you generally want to help animals?

02:36.280 --> 02:42.920
We are having pets because you're feeling lonely or bored or you need you need excitement or some novelty or just a cute little pet

02:43.040 --> 02:49.080
Which is most people don't think this through. That's why like the shelter is a full of abandoned animals in the West

02:49.080 --> 02:54.200
Because people would take them in a spur of a moment and then

02:55.480 --> 02:58.440
Afterwards basically when that kind of novelty runs out

02:58.960 --> 03:04.360
You realize it's it's too demanding too much care too. It takes too much time too much effort so much responsibility

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Then you just give them

03:07.000 --> 03:12.080
What the places that sort of provide it, but really what you do is just make it someone else's problem and

03:12.960 --> 03:17.160
That all could have been prevented if you if you were a bit

03:17.160 --> 03:20.520
more self-reflexive before you commit it

03:21.600 --> 03:29.160
Obviously you have like things that like your parents or your family for example. You have no choice. You can't give them away

03:30.240 --> 03:32.240
and

03:32.240 --> 03:36.440
So that's why you sometimes you're bound with things that kind of create attachment for you

03:36.440 --> 03:39.480
But it doesn't mean that you're not responsible for the attachment part

03:39.480 --> 03:46.840
Yeah, you're not responsible for being paired with these people or those this to your family or song

03:46.840 --> 03:49.720
But you are responsible if you're emotionally attached upon it

03:50.680 --> 03:55.640
But if you think that you can free yourself from attachment just by dismissing these people or these things in the world

03:56.000 --> 03:59.080
You're so you have like serious the mistake and basically

03:59.800 --> 04:02.560
The attachment giving it up. It's much subtler than that

04:03.680 --> 04:06.840
So if somebody has a pet

04:06.840 --> 04:11.960
And they see that they are quite emotionally attached to it

04:12.440 --> 04:16.280
What should they do if they want to be themselves? Well, basically they should

04:18.600 --> 04:21.080
They should contemplate the death of that pet

04:22.200 --> 04:24.200
as much as they can

04:24.200 --> 04:27.240
Without abandoning it without stopping like

04:28.040 --> 04:33.480
We're drawing care for it and helping it, but you just have to keep reminding yourself

04:33.480 --> 04:38.600
To the point of view where you become sort of when you go emotionally above it above the floor

04:38.600 --> 04:43.560
That this thing that is this pet this friend or whatever whatever attitude you have towards it

04:43.560 --> 04:46.040
It's gonna go you will go you might die use it for it

04:48.040 --> 04:50.040
And it will it will

04:50.760 --> 04:53.960
It's unpleasant. That's what people are kind of either or

04:54.440 --> 05:00.440
Either I'll be fully invested emotionally or are completely dismiss it and throw it away and not have anything to do with it

05:00.440 --> 05:05.000
Because I'm afraid of my attachment. The fact that you're afraid you might get attached means you're not free

05:05.480 --> 05:08.440
From possibility of attachment means you're not free from nature of attachment

05:10.280 --> 05:12.680
And that's the problem that's not a problem

05:17.320 --> 05:21.720
And like you you might you can give away the pet there will be other things you then attach attached to

05:22.840 --> 05:25.720
So really you want to recognize the problem and then see okay

05:25.720 --> 05:29.480
There are certain things that are not necessary a certain degree of involvement is not necessary

05:29.480 --> 05:32.280
And you've been doing it purely out of attachment

05:33.000 --> 05:38.360
Now when you become aware of the attachment you will naturally be draw yourself to a certain degree

05:38.760 --> 05:45.080
But there is all blanket rule how much you must be withdrawn from the world and from your engagements different people

05:45.800 --> 05:47.800
Measure these things differently

05:47.800 --> 05:51.800
The engagement means different things for them or some people can take more of it some people can't

05:52.760 --> 05:54.760
So that that should not be the criteria

05:54.760 --> 05:59.000
Like how many pets you have for example or how many charities you support

05:59.560 --> 06:03.720
No criteria should be how much of the attachment is there in regard to it

06:12.120 --> 06:17.880
And in regard to animals still do you think it's best to leave them alone

06:19.080 --> 06:21.080
Not interfere as a human being

06:21.080 --> 06:25.720
I think there's universal law you can do whatever you like basically doesn't mean you won't pay the price for it

06:27.880 --> 06:30.520
You know if you're in a position to help why wouldn't you?

06:31.720 --> 06:34.440
I mean even the Buddha himself said giving even to an animal

06:34.840 --> 06:38.120
Or not even to a specific animal just throwing away food and saying

06:38.520 --> 06:43.000
Made those animals and creatures that feed on this food feed on this food that are thrown away

06:43.400 --> 06:47.560
That would bring you merit and and sort of like a good reward for your actions

06:47.560 --> 06:50.600
Let alone let alone helping helping

06:51.560 --> 06:54.440
Helping humans or helping greater number of animals and so on

06:55.160 --> 06:59.640
But yeah, you don't have to do it. You don't have to do any of it. It's not like you must help. No, you don't

07:01.640 --> 07:07.320
But aren't they some people think that animals are happier

07:08.440 --> 07:10.440
When they're not around human beings

07:10.440 --> 07:13.880
Yeah, they might think that and what they should do is ask themselves. Why do they think that?

07:13.880 --> 07:21.960
And you probably want to find out that they think it because they want to find the justification for them not helping animals in the first place

07:22.840 --> 07:27.560
Like when they are in position to do when they wouldn't even necessarily be attached to it even they help them

07:28.200 --> 07:32.760
And they still don't do it. And then they would find oh, well, that's whatever they say that that's their karma

07:32.760 --> 07:35.400
They deserve it basically and that's just ridiculous

07:35.400 --> 07:44.840
Even if they do deserve it that still has nothing to do with you choosing to not help somebody in need of help animal or human

07:46.600 --> 07:49.400
Now if you don't help, yeah, you don't have to feel guilty

07:50.520 --> 07:54.280
It's it's you know, it's really up to you to do whatever you want

07:55.480 --> 08:02.600
But if you're self-honest and if you question your motive, you'll see that usually not helping is rooted in unwholesome motives

08:02.600 --> 08:08.440
Either it will dismiss or can't be bothered can't live in care or too lazy or whatever

08:10.040 --> 08:12.040
And if you're aware of it, you wouldn't want it

08:18.760 --> 08:20.760
What about newturing?

08:23.800 --> 08:29.080
Sorry, what about newturing newturing the animals your pets so they can't have

08:29.080 --> 08:31.080
They can't work

08:32.280 --> 08:35.880
Well, of course now to answer that question obviously it would

08:36.680 --> 08:42.600
Depends what what point of view you come from but obviously as as somebody who practices the dharma

08:43.400 --> 08:47.320
And a Buddhist person. It's probably the best thing you can do for an animal

08:48.520 --> 08:53.320
Because animals stay animals as in the remain bound to central animal central realm

08:53.880 --> 08:57.960
Because all the thoughts all the actions revolve around senses

08:57.960 --> 09:04.520
Around animal intentions around cravings sexuality food fighting is constantly driven

09:05.400 --> 09:07.720
And because of that, it's so hard to break

09:08.760 --> 09:11.800
Hearts of the animal river and that's what the Buddha said

09:11.800 --> 09:18.200
It takes like a blind and similar for blind turtle coming up to the top of the sea top of the ocean once every 500 years

09:19.560 --> 09:22.280
And there is a yoke a piece of wood with a hole in it

09:22.280 --> 09:27.800
It's been sort of thrown and floating left and right thrown by the winds and the waves

09:27.800 --> 09:31.560
And this this blind turtle that comes from the bottom once 500 years

09:32.200 --> 09:36.920
Has a greater chance of sticking its head through that hole in that little piece of wood

09:37.240 --> 09:43.320
It's being thrown constantly then a being that has fallen into an animal realm has a chance of coming back to human realm

09:44.920 --> 09:49.080
Why because you look at them whatever they do it's bound with the animal realm entirely

09:49.080 --> 09:52.120
So they cannot have things sort of

09:53.800 --> 09:58.040
Like a full of the nature that would then result in a higher river

10:00.200 --> 10:02.040
So why neutering is good is because

10:03.160 --> 10:08.040
animals can't restrain themselves the only way they can restrain themselves is if that's

10:08.040 --> 10:11.960
That restraint is placed externally mind you that's true for most of humans

10:11.960 --> 10:20.280
But we speak about animals so basically the lucky animal is the one that has properly strained placed upon it

10:20.920 --> 10:24.680
Externally as in by a human not like violence no violence

10:24.680 --> 10:27.640
No, so like neutering them as we're done with these dogs

10:28.040 --> 10:31.640
You saw the the massive difference is like they don't think about sexuality anymore

10:32.440 --> 10:35.000
And you do remember when they did think about it

10:35.400 --> 10:37.400
Well, like a madness would come over the mind

10:37.400 --> 10:42.520
Which means all the actions they'll be committing on account of it are very very unwholesome and they have no

10:42.920 --> 10:45.080
They don't have enough self-reflection to see that

10:45.960 --> 10:51.080
So in a way they're victim victims, but they're victims of their own actions and that's why it keeps repatriating itself

10:51.960 --> 10:58.360
So the lucky dog for example or a cat or whatever the one that you knew to means you took that very powerful

10:58.760 --> 11:01.640
Unwholesome dimension out of their existence basically

11:01.640 --> 11:08.440
Sexuality craving fighting I mean raping it's horrible, but when they get into the mating the heat

11:08.520 --> 11:13.640
It's just violence when you look on the roads and streets and they lose perspective as well completely

11:14.280 --> 11:18.200
Come back malnourished ripped apart because they were fighting for dominance and whatnot

11:18.760 --> 11:23.640
Everything just unholesome on top of their wholesome and now you're new to them and that whole dimension is gone

11:23.880 --> 11:26.360
They can't even think about it anymore that one act upon it

11:26.360 --> 11:36.200
So you could see that in an animal realm which could be considered a darker realm as in all the actions are bound with centrality and ill will and craving and fear and so on

11:37.960 --> 11:43.240
Having an absence of the same amount of bad actions can actually mean a lot of positive

11:43.960 --> 11:50.360
In the same sense with the Buddha said in the darker realms even just like a fleeting thought a positive thought

11:50.360 --> 11:55.560
Uh even even even very fleeting in the nature can mean a lot why because there isn't any

11:56.200 --> 12:01.240
So it would really stand out and it would then bring those those beings back up to high realms where they can

12:01.720 --> 12:03.720
become aware of their self-reflection

12:04.600 --> 12:08.200
And consequently that's where they would have said the people who live their life unrestrained

12:09.000 --> 12:13.160
Don't even keep the five precepts and basically just follow every single desire that they have

12:13.880 --> 12:15.880
Scratch ditch whenever it reaches

12:15.880 --> 12:20.920
Uh they're not different than animals and usually that's the realm they're heading their behavior is taking that

12:23.080 --> 12:25.880
When you just react upon any impulse that comes your way

12:26.760 --> 12:33.800
And completely are unaware due to your own obscuring unaware of the responsibility that you actually inherently carry

12:34.440 --> 12:36.840
For your own choices and your own freedom

12:37.880 --> 12:39.880
So that's why I mean people don't have to help anyone

12:39.880 --> 12:46.600
But you should really ask yourself if you choose not to help well ask yourself why why did you make that choice

12:47.640 --> 12:53.400
Why was it rooted? Was it really carelessness laziness hatred whatever just put find it up

12:55.160 --> 13:00.200
So is there any other way that you could help animals if you wanted to other than

13:00.920 --> 13:05.400
I mean you might want to do that as well. Right. Well, I think obviously just

13:05.400 --> 13:11.720
Uh providing like feeding them for example means there'll be less on on on that verge of hunger

13:11.720 --> 13:13.720
They will they will make them edgy

13:13.800 --> 13:18.440
And uh and then in a fighting mode and and and greedy and stealing and so on

13:19.000 --> 13:24.200
Some things sure vaccinations so you'll help them obviously like if you can but shelter

13:24.600 --> 13:29.880
Providing shelter providing medicine providing food then if you have the ability train them a bit

13:30.680 --> 13:32.680
Just make them wait for the food

13:32.680 --> 13:35.400
Literally, that's something that people could benefit from

13:36.280 --> 13:40.600
I eat whenever I feel an urge to put something my mouth basically not when I'm hungry

13:41.480 --> 13:45.240
And actually the Buddha did say that in one of the suitors that in some regard

13:45.880 --> 13:47.880
animals are actually

13:47.880 --> 13:51.240
More virtues than most of the like the contemporary people at the time

13:52.040 --> 13:56.520
Said they would mate only when there was basically a season when a female would be in the season

13:56.520 --> 14:03.000
But at the time when we were saying that you would have these these rich people would have like many for many wives and just

14:03.320 --> 14:06.120
constantly having sexual intercourse left and right

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Without a purpose just

14:10.120 --> 14:12.120
So

14:13.800 --> 14:15.800
So purpose was sent

14:15.800 --> 14:17.800
The

14:24.840 --> 14:29.560
The other thing that the Buddha did say was in regards to the same sort of uh, sutra was the um

14:31.720 --> 14:34.680
Yeah, like the animals would eat when they're hungry the dogs

14:35.480 --> 14:37.480
But then you had people like like a

14:37.560 --> 14:41.880
Growing wealth and just not sharing and just eating whenever they wanted just holding it

14:41.880 --> 14:45.640
It's being greedy basically so in that regard animals are more restrained

14:46.280 --> 14:51.080
But obviously, you know sexuality is a big part in every being sort of life

14:52.600 --> 14:58.440
And certainly can be a great motivator which always results in unwholesome proliferation of desire

14:59.480 --> 15:02.920
Which is then responsible for your rebirth and actions you committed an account of it

15:03.640 --> 15:06.600
So so do just just helping animals in that sense

15:06.600 --> 15:12.360
You would basically prevent the whole the whole domain of attachment for them

15:13.320 --> 15:16.440
On account of which you'll be doing lots of lots of unwholesome actions

15:17.880 --> 15:19.880
Like even for a female dog as well

15:21.240 --> 15:23.960
I mean first of all you help in not going through that whole

15:24.600 --> 15:29.160
Process of being basically gangraved by the bunch of by a pack of dogs

15:29.160 --> 15:33.000
Which is how you might not happen when people are kind of carefully breeding dogs

15:33.000 --> 15:37.720
But when you look out on the road, it's like 10 males and it's just battlefield

15:38.120 --> 15:43.400
Two weeks for two weeks are just crying and abuse horrible and then on top of it

15:44.040 --> 15:48.200
Puppies children are the greatest attachment and it's no different for animals

15:48.360 --> 15:53.800
So people think oh you're depriving these animals of happiness. Yeah, well that happiness is just like 1%

15:55.080 --> 15:58.600
On top of the 99% of pain and exposure to pain

15:58.600 --> 16:05.160
But not just that she can barely fend for herself and provide for herself like a stray dog

16:05.160 --> 16:09.720
For example, I say six puppies to feed and you see that when you see the stray dog with puppies

16:10.680 --> 16:12.520
When she starts breastfeeding, it just

16:13.160 --> 16:17.320
turns into this completely emensiated sort of skeleton but within a week

16:18.280 --> 16:20.600
Because they don't get enough and then you think that's pleasant

16:22.520 --> 16:26.360
That's pleasant for the dog and for the puppies it is and it's just completely the opposite just torture

16:26.360 --> 16:29.240
And most of the puppies will end up dying

16:29.240 --> 16:33.720
And and probably the mother as well if not if she doesn't die clearly it's gonna take her like half a year

16:34.120 --> 16:38.440
To recover to the fur back and health back by which time she's gonna get pregnant again

16:39.480 --> 16:41.960
And then again and it's just a constant sort of

16:42.920 --> 16:44.920
being subjected to just a constant

16:45.480 --> 16:49.480
Pressure and and striving and greed and fear and fighting

16:49.480 --> 16:53.960
Yeah, and you remove that and it's just a happy dog

16:56.920 --> 16:58.600
And what if what if your dogs get

17:00.120 --> 17:02.120
Get very sick

17:04.040 --> 17:06.360
And one of them I in a lot of pain

17:08.360 --> 17:10.360
There's no cure

17:11.880 --> 17:13.880
Would you consider euthanate

17:13.880 --> 17:17.080
No, of course not

17:17.080 --> 17:19.080
They'll die anyway, we're all gonna die anyway

17:20.040 --> 17:21.080
Um

17:21.080 --> 17:24.600
To think if if a dog were to have a choice to do it itself

17:25.240 --> 17:27.240
Yeah, I wouldn't feel really either

17:27.240 --> 17:28.600
But they don't

17:28.600 --> 17:30.600
Which means you'll be killing it

17:31.080 --> 17:33.560
Even if it was a lot of pain doesn't matter

17:34.760 --> 17:36.760
because

17:36.760 --> 17:38.760
The pains that you can perceive

17:38.760 --> 17:45.000
And someone else dying might not be anything in comparison to the pains of a being actually dying

17:47.720 --> 17:51.160
In other words, like it might look painful, but it's still alive

17:51.240 --> 17:55.400
But when it actually starts dying, that's the worst type of pain and that is according to the Buddha

17:55.880 --> 18:01.160
But usually people judge this situation based on how they feel or I can't bear to watch this so I'll kill it

18:02.280 --> 18:07.000
Compassionately, I'll put it out of my misery pretty much. Yeah, I'll put it out of my misery

18:07.000 --> 18:08.600
Yeah, that's that's how it should read

18:11.480 --> 18:15.720
I mean again, you can do whatever you want, but don't deceive yourself. You are killing it

18:18.200 --> 18:24.040
But what about like dog shelters like they get always stray dogs. Yeah, I give it 20,000 dogs

18:25.240 --> 18:27.240
They're killing it

18:27.240 --> 18:28.360
But

18:28.360 --> 18:31.160
I mean obviously they're responsible for the act of guessing them

18:31.160 --> 18:38.680
And whatever means they use but whoever gives their dog to a shelter is also responsible for killing them

18:40.120 --> 18:44.920
If they end up being killed because they wouldn't have ended being killed if you didn't put them in a shelter, they'd kill dogs

18:47.480 --> 18:53.080
So that's why I mean think twice before you actually choose to act and commit and do things

18:55.320 --> 18:57.320
In any area of life

18:57.320 --> 19:03.720
But people's judgment basically it's usually emotional which is not really a judgment

19:04.280 --> 19:12.040
It's more a reaction. I want this habit and then I'm only going to look at the reasons for having it

19:13.080 --> 19:19.320
I'm not going to stop and think about and maybe be patient and see if I change my mind or if I really throw this through

19:20.680 --> 19:23.160
And not just for the pets in general, in general

19:23.160 --> 19:27.160
So that's get you really

19:54.040 --> 19:58.200
So another question that usually comes up for a lot of people

20:00.200 --> 20:07.560
How can monastics be withdrawn from central pleasures if they are using the internet

20:10.360 --> 20:14.200
The internet for it's a very sensual thing

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
Right so

20:16.920 --> 20:22.920
How do you have to use the internet for some reason? Yeah, you use it for that particular reason

20:23.640 --> 20:25.640
Basically internet is a tool

20:26.440 --> 20:34.440
So if you use tool to gain sensuality, yeah, but you don't blame the tool you blame your own central intentions and your own central actions

20:35.960 --> 20:39.320
You cannot engage in sensuality without having sort of

20:40.280 --> 20:43.320
Without perceived it as a sensual as a sensual

20:43.320 --> 20:46.920
A desire as a central outcome that you want to pursue

20:47.400 --> 20:53.480
Which means sensuality is always intentional you can't accidentally stumble like engage in sensuality

20:55.480 --> 21:01.080
So the question here, it's not like whether you should use internet or not the question is are you restrained or not?

21:03.960 --> 21:07.160
If you're not restrained, then yeah, you should foresee these circumstances

21:07.160 --> 21:09.640
They might tempt you further and then you avoid it

21:09.640 --> 21:13.080
But even then you don't place responsibility on avoidance of these things

21:13.800 --> 21:17.320
Because the real problem is you not having a food sensuality

21:17.800 --> 21:22.680
So you might avoid internet all you want, but you can still spend your time with sensual thoughts, sensual cravings

21:23.160 --> 21:25.080
living on top of a mountain

21:25.080 --> 21:26.920
And be equally bound by it

21:26.920 --> 21:32.280
Even one day you have to use the internet well sooner or later something will happen where you're going to be exposed to things

21:32.280 --> 21:33.800
They used to cause you

21:33.800 --> 21:40.120
Basically sensual desire and you're going to have it again because you haven't done anything about it

21:40.120 --> 21:42.120
You can't spend your whole life in hiding

21:42.120 --> 21:48.520
And there was that very nice suit, the similarly of the bait, the deer herd that we talked about

21:48.520 --> 21:49.720
Well, like most people would

21:50.440 --> 21:54.600
The hunter places the food that has a bait in it

21:55.560 --> 21:59.000
And that's basically like a description of, similarly for sensuality

21:59.000 --> 22:04.200
It baits you to become sort of engaged with it and attached just because of that promised pleasure

22:05.400 --> 22:10.360
So the most people would be sort of careless and they'll just be eating it together with a bait

22:10.360 --> 22:12.760
They wouldn't even see it as a problem, they wouldn't even see the bait

22:13.800 --> 22:18.520
Then there's a group of people who recognize that and then say, okay, we need to restrain ourselves

22:18.520 --> 22:22.760
Because that's basically, but they can't draw a line between a food and a bait

22:22.760 --> 22:25.480
So then they dismiss the entire domain of food

22:25.480 --> 22:30.360
And they would have said, they're like a deer herd that runs on top of a mountain and then they live there

22:31.320 --> 22:35.800
But sooner or later the food will, whatever they've been living on in the mountain will dry out

22:35.800 --> 22:38.520
And then they will come back to the same environment that they despised

22:39.080 --> 22:43.000
And they would eat carelessly, they wouldn't see the bait and they would remain the same as the first herd

22:44.280 --> 22:48.600
And then the third one would be basically the one who's seen the first, seen the second

22:48.600 --> 22:51.480
And then they realize actually we must not shun the food

22:51.480 --> 22:56.920
We just have to learn how to eat it carefully without engaging with the bait, without being hooked

22:57.640 --> 22:59.000
And that's the whole point

22:59.000 --> 23:01.880
But that refers to basically avoiding sensuality

23:01.880 --> 23:05.480
Not like flirting with sensuality and carefully so you don't get no

23:05.480 --> 23:08.040
Flirting with sensuality means you're basically already hooked

23:09.160 --> 23:15.720
But learning how to eat carefully or in other words learning how to be restrained and seeing where your responsibility is

23:15.720 --> 23:21.560
Because that's what I mean, like people would blame the food, blame the internet, blame this

23:22.040 --> 23:25.400
Blame the city, blame the environment, but that's not a problem

23:25.400 --> 23:28.760
The problem is your attitude of sensuality in regard to it

23:32.360 --> 23:36.520
So if you recognize that that's on you, your exercise is restrained to the right degree

23:38.040 --> 23:42.680
And then you could see genuinely, oh this is a tool, this can be used wholesomely

23:42.680 --> 23:46.200
Obviously this cannot be used wholesomely

23:46.200 --> 23:49.720
Things like sexual intercourse, they're fully already perverted by the desire

23:49.720 --> 23:52.840
Which means you can't do it rightly, you have to abandon it altogether

24:05.000 --> 24:07.400
So if a person does have problem with a restraint, sure

24:07.400 --> 24:15.800
So minimize your exposure to things, they're the challenging you, but don't project your responsibility on to those things

24:15.800 --> 24:16.440
It's a new

24:18.120 --> 24:19.800
You have to see it, your weakness

24:19.800 --> 24:23.240
Well exactly, you have to see it and then you have to see what the problem is

24:23.240 --> 24:26.840
The problem is not the internet, the problem is not the central objects

24:26.840 --> 24:29.160
The problem is your sensuality in regard to it

24:30.920 --> 24:34.120
And you're not going to approve that just by dismissing the central objects

24:34.120 --> 24:39.080
Or the objects that could potentially result in central outcome

24:40.920 --> 24:46.840
And if you start clarifying that, then yeah, then you are developing enough space basically to see

24:46.840 --> 24:50.360
And to move about without taking things up in central manner

24:50.360 --> 25:05.720
And you become quite strong because you can withstand the possibilities

25:06.600 --> 25:09.240
Well, not just withstand, you actually are uprooted

25:10.440 --> 25:14.520
The possibility of you centrally engaging in central possibilities

25:15.560 --> 25:17.400
And that's when you know you're beyond sensuality

25:17.400 --> 25:24.120
That's like no amount of central objects will become a temptation anymore

25:24.120 --> 25:28.520
Because the mind has fully seen and discerned the danger of sensuality

25:28.520 --> 25:31.640
And the inherent basically repulsiveness of it

25:32.600 --> 25:35.640
Being a victim to your own desire, you fully understood that

25:36.280 --> 25:38.920
And that's, and by doing so you have abandoned it

25:40.440 --> 25:44.120
So then you can't actually engage with it, like it's inconceivable

25:44.120 --> 25:48.920
The Buddha would say it's like as if a man would sort of eat some delicious food

25:48.920 --> 25:50.200
And then he would vomit it out

25:51.160 --> 25:54.280
And that would he have a desire to eat that vomit again

25:54.280 --> 26:14.440
He just wouldn't think inconceivable, would be repelled by the thought of it

26:14.440 --> 26:20.360
So you said earlier about how to overcome attachments like to your dogs or to a pet

26:20.360 --> 26:28.680
I mean, to contemplate the possibility inevitable possibility of their death

26:28.680 --> 26:29.960
And to free from attachment

26:29.960 --> 26:36.440
When I say contemplate, I mean allow yourself to emotionally feel the significance of those things

26:36.440 --> 26:42.280
Not like explain to yourself just basically to appease your own emotional disturbance

26:42.280 --> 26:45.160
At the thought of your favorite pet dying or something

26:45.160 --> 26:49.000
No, don't go out of the old diet and then you start explaining

26:49.000 --> 26:51.400
You actually want to take it on that emotional level

26:52.680 --> 26:56.520
Basically to not be afraid to feel the death of the loved ones

26:59.240 --> 27:01.720
And there will basically pressure your mind into growth

27:02.360 --> 27:03.720
Your mind will have to grow out of it

27:04.520 --> 27:06.040
Or it will have to succumb to it

27:06.040 --> 27:13.000
It reminds me of what you're saying this morning about

27:14.760 --> 27:19.080
being intoxicated with youth and intoxicated with health and talking to the judge

27:22.280 --> 27:25.720
It's it's well, thank you for granted your own life

27:26.520 --> 27:31.080
You start taking for granted lives of other things, beings, or animals or humans

27:31.080 --> 27:36.280
Which means death even a notion of it is going to be frightening

27:37.640 --> 27:40.920
To you, to your emotional equilibrium is going to be a challenge

27:42.040 --> 27:46.280
So unless you recognize that as a problem, you can't sort of grow out

27:46.280 --> 27:49.000
You can't develop yourself out of it, you just can't

27:49.880 --> 27:52.600
Because you've gone all of your efforts will be about covering it up

27:52.600 --> 28:00.600
Well, we all died and none of that, all of that is done just to prevent you from taking it on personally

28:01.560 --> 28:03.960
But if you if you start questioning basically just

28:04.840 --> 28:08.680
Well, the validity of that assumption, like why do I mean, yeah, we will all die

28:08.680 --> 28:12.920
So why don't I imagine that I might be dead by this afternoon or maybe even tomorrow?

28:13.320 --> 28:18.200
Like why would I why would I just assume that my life is ahead of me

28:18.200 --> 28:21.560
Or my health or my youth

28:23.560 --> 28:26.840
And if you start questioning these things on the level of of yourself

28:27.880 --> 28:34.680
Means you are automatically affecting any attachment that you had depending upon those things in regard to others

28:36.280 --> 28:41.800
In other words, if you become fully aware of your own mortality, you cannot be attached to other person's life

28:41.800 --> 28:47.400
Doesn't mean you become like a blind oblivious robotic creature

28:47.960 --> 28:50.280
No, you're still full aware of the significance of life

28:50.920 --> 28:54.760
Of helping animals or caring after people or whatever

28:55.160 --> 29:01.960
But none of that causes that emotional intoxication of of of assumption that this will last forever

29:04.040 --> 29:09.160
Which means when it changes when it goes away different to the way you expected it and hopeful

29:09.160 --> 29:11.160
So you won't be affected by it

29:12.200 --> 29:14.920
Your perspective will remain basically

29:16.360 --> 29:18.360
Undiminished it just would not change

29:19.720 --> 29:21.880
Because it wasn't dependent upon that anymore

29:23.320 --> 29:25.960
And that's the true meaning of being free from attachment and freedom

29:26.680 --> 29:32.360
Not like not recognizing the significance of, you know, dying loved ones or something like that

29:32.440 --> 29:36.440
No, on the contrary being fully able to let it arise to the extent

29:36.440 --> 29:39.640
It wants to arise and you won't have to do anything about it

29:40.040 --> 29:42.680
You don't have to jump into grief, break down into tears

29:43.480 --> 29:46.360
You're able to hold it and keep perspective in regard to it

29:48.680 --> 29:50.920
As those enlightened people in the sutras would say like

29:51.880 --> 29:57.960
How could it be otherwise when they were facing somebody dying the good friend or mother, father, whatever

29:58.680 --> 30:00.680
It would be just like

30:00.680 --> 30:05.320
How could it be otherwise? How could a thing that has a reason or dying?

30:06.840 --> 30:12.600
It's no surprise. It wasn't surprise. No, it's well. It's surprising to think that it can be otherwise

30:12.600 --> 30:29.160
That's a surprise for those who cannot think that anyway

30:29.160 --> 30:39.400
That's very much

30:40.840 --> 30:43.560
Those are very much in this

30:44.280 --> 30:45.960
Think about

30:45.960 --> 30:47.080
Premeditate

30:47.080 --> 30:50.760
Yeah, think about death think about loss of health

30:51.640 --> 30:53.080
Agee

30:53.080 --> 30:55.080
Yeah, the right thing you basically

30:55.080 --> 31:01.640
The right thought people people think right thought will come out for tennis the other some sort of magical experience

31:02.040 --> 31:05.800
No, right thought will come up if you stop engaging

31:06.600 --> 31:08.600
nurturing and maintaining the wrong thought

31:09.480 --> 31:12.920
And the wrong thought is any thought of greed aversion delusion any thought that

31:13.640 --> 31:18.280
It's based upon assumption that perpetuates these gratuitous assumptions and intoxications

31:18.280 --> 31:24.520
Meet your life with your health. I mean people think just like when they're healthy, you think you're never going to get sick

31:25.400 --> 31:28.440
And then just the thought that you might get sick freaks you out all the way

31:29.160 --> 31:32.760
It's like nothing. There's no no no safe zone in between

31:33.720 --> 31:35.960
It's like when people get a flu. They just full-on

31:36.680 --> 31:38.840
Panic they want every medicine from the shelf

31:39.640 --> 31:45.320
Doctor to give them just just to get rid of this discomfort because it's threatening to my existential assumption of

31:45.320 --> 31:49.080
Of an indefinite health. All right, whatever

31:49.480 --> 31:54.520
Purple on the face. Oh, yeah, sure sure a pimple on the face. Oh, it's like what a

31:55.240 --> 32:00.040
Or a hair going the other way you don't want it to go something just interfering with your perception of yourself

32:01.560 --> 32:05.560
And it's like bothering you on that existential level. No, it's not like it's not optional

32:06.760 --> 32:10.520
You can't remain indifferent towards you are being emotionally oppressed

32:10.520 --> 32:13.960
And you're doing it yourself basically

32:15.640 --> 32:23.000
By maintaining those assumptions that when then they when they're challenged by the circumstances of the world they go against

32:24.040 --> 32:28.840
Your your your desires basically. Yeah, you cannot remain in depth. You are affected

32:29.800 --> 32:37.480
So suffering is as the bullet described in the most general term basically not getting what what what what one wants

32:37.480 --> 32:40.040
And being paired with things that one doesn't want

32:41.400 --> 32:47.640
In brief basically you there's five ugly ties in your experiences a whole attachment to it in any shape or form

32:48.040 --> 32:50.040
That's why suffering is there

32:58.120 --> 33:00.120
Actually, I was going to ask

33:00.120 --> 33:07.400
This question you touched and touched in a bit is how to improve your thinking how to make your thinking clearer

33:08.600 --> 33:10.600
and right

33:11.160 --> 33:16.120
Think about the right things right deeply. Well, that's that's the thing the first step is to

33:17.160 --> 33:23.000
To get a hint at least that actually this might be a valuable thing to do learn how to think properly

33:25.080 --> 33:28.120
Then if you do then you can start looking closer and then basically see

33:28.120 --> 33:34.280
What is what are the things that are sort of against right mindful thinking?

33:35.560 --> 33:42.760
Essential desire is by giving into central desire to the emotional needs you are compromising your own reason

33:43.400 --> 33:45.640
not some people do more some people do less but

33:46.680 --> 33:53.080
Nevertheless, that's in common to every time you give into desire or or need for emotional satisfaction

33:53.080 --> 33:58.760
Or central satisfaction to that degree you compromise your reason you compromise your mindfulness

33:59.640 --> 34:03.480
Even if you're actually contemplating in pre meditating heart engaging centrality

34:03.880 --> 34:08.280
That's not done in that rifle manner because it's not founded upon mindfulness and self-awareness

34:09.480 --> 34:12.760
You are projected towards a project of sensuality or whatever else

34:14.600 --> 34:17.080
So so recognizing what what goes against

34:17.080 --> 34:23.880
You can't compose mindful thinking clear clear clarity exactly foggy

34:24.920 --> 34:26.680
foggy obtuse

34:26.680 --> 34:31.960
Of fake whatever it's all against it. So ill will anger. It's it's against it

34:32.680 --> 34:34.680
engaging in angry behavior

34:35.080 --> 34:40.360
Cultivating ill will and hatred you are basically obscuring your own perspective on yourself

34:41.640 --> 34:43.240
Same with centrality

34:43.240 --> 34:47.640
Same with distraction in general. You just want to do something because you're bored

34:48.520 --> 34:51.960
Boredom is actually clarity and that's why people fear it

34:52.920 --> 34:57.480
Because it reveals things that you don't want to admit to yourself yet. They're always there

34:58.520 --> 35:02.680
That's why people always need things to do. It's essentially they depend upon constant

35:03.480 --> 35:08.280
Performing of action and finding meaning in random things just to make them do stuff because

35:08.680 --> 35:11.640
It basically keeps you keeps you floating or so it seems

35:11.640 --> 35:15.320
If you run out of things to do if you run out of even the most

35:15.880 --> 35:17.880
frivolous prep frivolous purpose

35:18.920 --> 35:21.480
You basically feel like you begin to sink

35:23.880 --> 35:25.880
But the problem with that whole

35:27.640 --> 35:31.960
Set the whole view is the sooner or later you won't be able to do things

35:33.560 --> 35:36.680
And what you're going to have left is that which will be running away from your whole life

35:37.320 --> 35:39.320
That's why old age is very unpleasant

35:39.320 --> 35:43.880
Because the body stops listening. You lost your health. You lost your strength. You lost your youth

35:45.800 --> 35:50.920
The senses are failing. You can't get distracted now through beautiful sides. You can't even appreciate it anymore

35:50.920 --> 35:55.240
It just hurts to look hurts to hear it. It's not present eating

35:55.880 --> 35:57.880
And what's your left is yourself

35:58.120 --> 36:01.240
That's what you're left with and that's something you didn't want to be with your whole life

36:01.720 --> 36:05.480
And that's why you've been using the intoxication with intoxication with health

36:05.480 --> 36:11.160
Youth and life and sensuality in general just to keep sort of surfing

36:11.720 --> 36:14.440
On top of it without having to face what's underneath

36:17.320 --> 36:20.120
There's a lot of clarity

36:21.000 --> 36:22.440
Awareness

36:22.440 --> 36:24.440
Constantable awareness

36:24.840 --> 36:26.840
Can be very painful. Is that boredom?

36:27.320 --> 36:31.560
It's very painful because clarity. Well clarity is not painful, but it reveals

36:31.560 --> 36:36.120
The painful background and that background is painful only because you're resisting it

36:37.000 --> 36:39.480
Only because your habits of your life

36:40.120 --> 36:43.160
The ones you've been engaging with are the ones that are taking you away from it

36:43.800 --> 36:45.800
namely sensuality

36:46.440 --> 36:48.440
Just following your desires for granted

36:49.160 --> 36:50.520
wanting

36:50.520 --> 36:55.400
To have whatever your desire basically directs you directs you at and because of that

36:56.280 --> 36:59.000
Not engaging that behavior is being painful

36:59.000 --> 37:01.320
So you created a pain

37:02.680 --> 37:04.360
Of boredom

37:04.360 --> 37:07.160
As in boredom you create a boredom because you don't want it

37:08.200 --> 37:09.640
Boredom in itself

37:09.640 --> 37:11.400
It's not neutral

37:11.400 --> 37:14.920
Sorry, it's neutral. It's not unpleasant. It's not the present or unpleasant

37:15.640 --> 37:18.360
That's what would I say if you understand neutral feeling

37:19.000 --> 37:21.160
It is felt as pleasant

37:21.160 --> 37:23.160
If you don't understand it as in if you're still

37:23.160 --> 37:28.680
Basically affecting it with assumptions and and and frequency notions and habits of sensuality

37:29.080 --> 37:31.080
Then it's going to feel unpleasant

37:32.040 --> 37:36.040
Feeling nothing is going to feel unpleasant. It's going to feel threatening basically

37:42.040 --> 37:44.040
So do if you have any

37:44.440 --> 37:45.880
practices

37:45.880 --> 37:47.480
to clear ones

37:47.480 --> 37:49.480
Well physically restraint

37:49.480 --> 37:53.320
Not not engaging in distracted behavior sensory strain

37:54.040 --> 37:56.520
Not not engaging in in basically like

37:57.160 --> 38:01.480
Yeah, you have to stop for example drinking being careless taking drugs

38:01.880 --> 38:06.520
Because that certainly it's it's directly opposed to any clarity that you can maintain in your mind

38:08.040 --> 38:09.880
Then at the same time

38:09.880 --> 38:14.680
You also have to understand that the real clarity comes from understanding what clarity is

38:16.200 --> 38:18.200
Not from what feels clear

38:18.200 --> 38:21.400
That's inevitable beginning. We all start based on how we feel

38:21.800 --> 38:26.840
But you want to transcend it. You don't want to just be bound by how you feel and what you deem pleasant or unpleasant

38:28.200 --> 38:34.120
Because what people don't understand the clarity then they're just going to be pursuing that which they think clarity is

38:34.200 --> 38:36.200
Which is that which they deem agreeable

38:37.160 --> 38:39.160
not necessarily understood

38:39.320 --> 38:42.200
And that's when you have people overdoing the practice of clarity

38:42.360 --> 38:46.840
Trying to catch every single moment and things like that, but that's a contradiction in terms

38:46.840 --> 38:50.440
You have to catch a moment you have to be outside of the moment

38:50.440 --> 38:52.920
But if you're outside of the moment the moment is not in your experience

38:53.720 --> 38:58.520
So you're just chasing these hollow contradictory ideas on account to develop clarity

39:01.400 --> 39:05.160
So clarity is basically absence of greed aversion delusion

39:06.600 --> 39:12.680
If those things are not present in your experience, you don't have to then get rid of whatever else it's present

39:12.680 --> 39:16.360
Because all you care about is the unwholesome aspect

39:17.560 --> 39:19.560
But people usually can't

39:19.800 --> 39:24.520
Can't see where the line is so then they try to dismiss it all in the same sense when I we spoke just earlier

39:25.800 --> 39:27.960
Attachment is a problem. So I'll throw away everything

39:28.680 --> 39:33.400
Baby and the boss work the whole thing. Oh, I'm attached to this. I'm as destroyed. I must get rid of it

39:33.400 --> 39:36.760
I must give it up. That's how I free myself from my attachment where you want

39:36.760 --> 39:42.600
And the Buddha realized that when he came to the point of even trying to give up his own life because thinking that's the way out

39:42.600 --> 39:46.440
But then he realized it wasn't only gonna result in the dying unenlightened

39:47.480 --> 39:53.240
When he tried to stop his own breathing basic because of what I'm reading. I'm helping this life. That's a base of attachment

39:55.640 --> 40:01.880
Unfortunately, he didn't he saw through it and then he realized that actually no this only resulted in me being dead nothing lies in

40:01.880 --> 40:03.880
so

40:05.560 --> 40:07.560
Abandoned things that are unnecessary

40:09.320 --> 40:14.760
With a basically a full proliferation of and carelessness in regard to centrality ill will

40:16.760 --> 40:18.760
Restraint and moderation

40:19.960 --> 40:24.600
And then tried to understand that clarity don't ever do it either

40:26.920 --> 40:28.920
And or mystified

40:28.920 --> 40:30.920
What about

40:32.280 --> 40:35.240
Concentrating on a neutral object

40:36.280 --> 40:40.040
Would that take away all the unhulsing objects?

40:40.840 --> 40:47.400
Well, no because concentration for people today means absorption and if you're absorbing to something means you're not aware of yourself

40:47.880 --> 40:50.280
So how can develop self-reflection and self-clarity?

40:51.000 --> 40:56.600
If the basic premise of yourself being present and seeing that in the situation is not there

40:56.600 --> 41:01.480
That's why most of the contemporary meditation meditation techniques are completely misleading

41:02.680 --> 41:06.200
No doubt that a novelty experiences in peace come out of it

41:06.760 --> 41:10.440
But that peace is also peace at the cost of self-reflection

41:10.920 --> 41:14.040
Which means it's a it's a piece that's peaceful only because it's agreeable

41:14.600 --> 41:17.320
Not because it's a genuine clarity or contains wisdom

41:17.960 --> 41:19.960
It's only because it's a I find it agreeable

41:21.800 --> 41:23.320
And that's why often

41:23.320 --> 41:27.880
It ceases to be enough as well so that people need to do it harder for me harder

41:29.080 --> 41:32.040
To get more of that novelty back that's going to be a peaceful feeling

41:33.800 --> 41:39.960
But that's not the piece you want it's basically peace within the central domain and that's not peaceful

41:43.320 --> 41:45.320
But the power of concentration

41:47.160 --> 41:48.600
Yeah

41:48.600 --> 41:51.400
You don't want power to concentration you want power of reflection

41:51.400 --> 41:54.920
And then come the right concentration will come out of that

41:58.680 --> 42:00.680
Because you you don't again

42:01.400 --> 42:07.560
When a person is committing to some practice of concentration or account of the model and foggy and obtuse thinking

42:09.560 --> 42:11.560
No clarity of their thinking can arise

42:12.520 --> 42:14.520
Why because that that's basically

42:15.800 --> 42:19.800
The tools they're using to develop their concentration are the ones affected by ignorance

42:19.800 --> 42:25.080
And if you're not seeing that whatever you gain through them, it's just going to share the same nature

42:29.480 --> 42:33.160
Because people who think that what as long as I practice concentration of any kind

42:34.520 --> 42:40.760
That will transfer itself and I'll benefit from it in in other like spiritual development

42:42.040 --> 42:47.240
You want that development that you think it's spiritual. It's really the central which is why yeah

42:47.240 --> 42:50.600
Most people's practice of spirituality is very much central

42:51.640 --> 42:53.640
It's a practice of sensuality

42:57.320 --> 42:59.320
Attaining physical experiences

43:00.840 --> 43:06.280
Yeah, yeah, exactly physical basically obtaining agreeable experiences without trying to see

43:08.680 --> 43:13.240
Your motivation behind it or like fully understanding the nature that those experiences

43:13.240 --> 43:19.320
And you could say that any spiritual practice today, it's basically just spiritualizing sensuality

43:21.080 --> 43:24.680
It's true spiritual practice comes in you undoing the sensuality

43:25.320 --> 43:27.320
And then seeing what's there already

43:27.960 --> 43:32.760
Without you needing to have a desire for it or inspiration or whatever some sort of

43:34.680 --> 43:36.680
Spiritual uplifting

43:37.720 --> 43:41.480
That's why that's why if the dhamma is done rightly the Buddhist teachings are rightly

43:41.480 --> 43:46.920
Like nobody can stumble upon it by accident. Don't do some miraculous experience

43:47.800 --> 43:51.720
It's done through development. It's achieved through development and basically hard work

43:51.720 --> 43:54.840
That's why they would just praise the diligence self-reflection

43:54.840 --> 43:57.880
Not tolerating on wholesome states that you know are present in you

43:58.600 --> 44:03.560
And you're tolerating them by tolerating them you give rise to motivation that's rooted in them

44:05.560 --> 44:07.800
By giving rise to that sooner or later you're gonna act out of it

44:07.800 --> 44:12.920
So you end up being fully responsible for for the perpetuation of your own ignorance and lack of freedom

44:37.800 --> 44:39.800
Oh

44:43.080 --> 44:45.080
It's not enough room

44:45.480 --> 44:47.480
He's job visible. Yeah

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I only have one lap

44:55.480 --> 44:57.480
Come on get him get him

44:57.480 --> 45:07.480
Get him. She's coming
