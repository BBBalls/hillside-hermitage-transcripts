00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
It's about dealing with tinsets for annoying people, for just in general how to not be offended

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
about what others are doing or what they are saying to you, no matter what, it's kind of

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
something insulting you, how do you become bullied?

00:32.000 --> 00:44.000
Well that is, there is another thing that there has to be rooted in the strength before

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
basically because you get offended by people by insults because your mind has no control

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
over itself, so then immediately it jumps at the worst scenario, jumps at the insult and starts

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
not wanting it, resisting it, refusing it, wanting to retaliate because of it

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
but if you were able to keep your mind in check then the insult would just come and go

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
and you wouldn't be affected by it, but you can't expect to be able to keep your mind

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
in check if your body hasn't been kept in check and your speech hasn't been kept in check

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
so that's why, that's why it's a hard thing to do in a way because people are generally impatient

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
so they have a problem, they want to fix, but if they don't, but in order to fix it

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
you need to start building these bases for the fix, for the solution

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
because if you were a well-restraint person in regard to your own desires

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
they usually move people left and right, if you have confidence, if you have confidence

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
come from the restraint, from being able to say no to yourself, then you wouldn't lose perspective

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
even when others are basically abused you verbally or even physically

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
like you wouldn't, the mind would not feel beaten because of it

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
because it's basically the mind gives in, the mind makes itself insulted and affected by it

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
because those, the words, I mean the physical actions can stop at your body

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
the words, they stop at a level of speech, but then it's the mind picks it up,

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
persists, it doesn't want it, hates it, gives into your will on account of it or similar

02:30.000 --> 02:57.000
so if someone calls you an idiot, your views are ridiculous

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
if you were, you're going to get offended

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
you get offended if you were not clear about your own views beforehand

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
if you were holding on to them for various unwholesome reasons such as

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
a sense of identity or because you fancy yourself as an intelligent person, smart person, intellectual person

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
or just generally insecure and then you kind of find solace in conviction, faith

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
and then you solve the challenges that you did struck right in your call

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
but if your views have used the product of restraint and wisdom, nobody can tell it

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
I mean the whole world can disagree with it, like you wouldn't be able to be affected by it

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
because it's nothing wrong with it, it's not based on unwholesome, it doesn't harm anyone

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
and it frees you from suffering right there right now, sorry right here and now

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
in a sense of that you have a direct verification that you're not proved and controlled by your own desires

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
and as much as you used to be, which means there's already that sense of confidence

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
oh yeah, no this works, people can come and tell them no, that doesn't work

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
that's ridiculous, that's just nonsense

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
it won't make a difference to you because actually you've seen it work

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
so you would only, the only conclusion would be ah, they don't know what to talk about

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
because if they were to know, they would agree with this

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
which is universally right, freedom from desire in that sense, it means freedom

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
so if you have that kind of clarity internally, then insults will won't be able to insult you

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
like if somebody says something in your will, his or her or her or your wouldn't necessarily cause your or your will

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
and then you wouldn't because you're not full of your will, you wouldn't lose your own perspective

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
which means you would be able actually to hear what they're saying

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
even if it's a completely ridiculous nonsense insult

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
you would still be able to hear it because you're not immediately automatically or in a defensive

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
and then sometimes you would hear, actually he has a point there

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
I mean he's completely wrong because his full will will and coming from a wrong place

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
but that's not my problem

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
but the content of what he was saying, yeah, I should have known better, I made a mistake

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
and that's it, you wouldn't be able to take it personally

05:20.000 --> 05:28.000
you wouldn't be able to juggle, come in, you wouldn't be able to take it personally

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
and that's the problem, people cannot help but take this, well people's mind cannot help

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
but take whatever comes their way personally and then immediately end up either rejoicing in praise

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
or defending against the blame and attacking and fearing blame as well

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
even if it's completely grounded and ridiculous

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
they'll still fear just the phenomenon of blame and then then

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
it doesn't matter by whom or for if it's completely like if it's just after fabrication

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
it's not very true, it doesn't matter they'll still try to avoid blame for the sacred because they fear it

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
because they don't have that clarity and transparency and control over their own mind

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
you wouldn't be able to jump in it in that irrational manner

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
what about things like that?

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
no, no, like, it's like the weather

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
well again it's the same, similar attitude, just slightly more, slightly more subtle

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
can you pull the curtain please?

06:35.000 --> 06:44.000
I know again it is a form of you resisting things that are not really your goal

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
to get the example of the weather, to acquire your noise

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
because you have desires that require a good weather

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
and while those desires are present, the bad weather is causing that discrepancy

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
that's making you know you want to get rid of it

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
but can you get rid of the bad weather?

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
can't, so that's why it's important to recognize that that discrepancy is causing you to suffer

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
if it is then you will recognize that the way that you can remove that suffering is remove the discrepancy

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
so if you can't change the weather, you can't change external circumstances in the nature

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
which means what you can change is change what you want at the time, change your desire

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
if you remove the desires requiring a nice sunny day

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
you will be affected by it by no amount of rain or any other weather

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
if you had the desire to just stay in and not going anywhere

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
it doesn't matter if you are a knowledge, it's got to be a reason

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
and that reason is that basically what makes that discrepancy

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
so you can either continue blaming the circumstances, blame the weather, blame the world, blame the other people

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
or recognize that that is inevitable and that's not where that suffering is rooted, nor that discrepancy

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
it's rooted in things that you can say no to which is your own desire

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
but people take that for granted so they never want to say no to their own desire

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
which is why it's always someone else's fault whenever suffering arises

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
it's because of this or because of that, it's never because, oh, I crave and I cause discrepancy with my desires

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
and as a result of that discrepancy I suffer

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
there is no other cause of suffering like that as if craving is sometimes suffering or something

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
whenever there is suffering it's because discrepancy caused by craving, nothing else

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
and not like more or less or a bit later

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
to the extent that there is discrepancy to that extent there is suffering

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
and that discrepancy with craving is either trying to prolong that which doesn't last as long

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
trying to get rid of that which lasts too long

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
because there is certain techniques that some people might do

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
if someone's, you know, someone who's very an insultive person

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
who's got a lot of your wealth in you

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
right?

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
then you see them, you sort of think that they're only human

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
they make mistakes

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
no, all of those things are management of the problem

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
none of them, management cannot approve the problem

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
it can only manage it which means it requires it

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
so yes, in the beginning when there is absolutely, you don't believe that confusion

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
you don't know what to do so then your management can offer some sort of help

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
but it's a mistake to regard management as a way of practicing towards

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
abooting the problem altogether she won't arise ever again

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
because management just covers up, just builds the door

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
which means when the next one comes you have to manage

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
which means that's not freedom

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
when you need to do something whenever this occurs

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I need to go through these motions, I need to do it

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
sooner or later it's going to get too much

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
that's a definition of a burden, do you teach?

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
so you want to aim at the development of mind or meditation

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
or practice whereby you don't have to do anything on a kind of suffering

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
except see it

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
and you cannot not see it if you're just mindful

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
you'll always see it because you're mindful

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
and suffering is something that universally you cannot be oblivious to

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
which means all you have to do is remain mindful

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
and see the suffering and then the suffering which is

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
I mean if you're doing things rightly

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
then seeing suffering means uprooting the suffering

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
because you understood it

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
but management of suffering does not mean uprooting of suffering

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
so management of annoyance does not make you

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
impenetrable to future annoyance and you know that

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
you might become very skilled manager

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
and be able to deal with these things very quickly

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
but still you need to deal with this

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
which means you're affected in the first place

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
and freedom of it, freedom from it is when you're not affected

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
even in the first place

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
so that's the difference when it comes to freeing yourself from suffering

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
don't confuse management of it as the way out of it ultimately

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
it's not

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
the way out of it is understanding the nature of it

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
whereby having suffering or isn't means you're free from it

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
or simply put having suffering or isn't means it can't touch you anymore

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
a rising of suffering just reminds you that you're free of suffering

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
which means it's not your problem

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
which means it's not your suffering

11:45.000 --> 12:10.000
there is no suffering at all
