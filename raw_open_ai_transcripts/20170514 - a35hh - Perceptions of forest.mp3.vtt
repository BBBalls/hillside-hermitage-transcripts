WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.200
I was listening briefly this morning, the talk, learning how to feel, that one that you

00:09.200 --> 00:13.600
did some time ago, I don't know, kind of more recent.

00:13.600 --> 00:19.440
Anyway, in the beginning of it, you were talking about these ideas as like, for example,

00:19.440 --> 00:24.520
you go into the village and you establish your mind, perceptions of the forest, you know,

00:24.520 --> 00:29.760
affected by anything in the village, but I found it difficult to understand that when

00:29.760 --> 00:34.360
I tried to think of what does that mean, or it did this time as well, imagining myself

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
in a forest.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.800
Yeah, because you were not actually in the forest, that's, you couldn't have established

00:39.800 --> 00:43.840
your, well, if you were in the forest and you might go to establish your own perception

00:43.840 --> 00:49.080
of the forests, then you could quite likely be able to establish yourself still upon those

00:49.080 --> 00:53.120
perceptions, even when you cease to be in the forest, but if you haven't been in the forest

00:53.120 --> 00:58.560
and if you haven't established your mind upon the perceptions of the forest, then obviously

00:58.560 --> 00:59.560
can't do that.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.920
It would remain on the level of abstraction.

01:02.920 --> 01:09.000
And the reason why perceptions of the forest, well, in that subter, it's because what

01:09.000 --> 01:13.240
is the main difference between a remote wilderness forest and village?

01:13.240 --> 01:16.400
What would be the main difference?

01:16.400 --> 01:26.320
No, people, absence of people, absence of others, just like the main characteristic of

01:26.320 --> 01:32.800
the, if you establish your mind upon the perceptions of the forest, means no others.

01:32.800 --> 01:38.000
And then you stay established upon that perception when you go among others.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.280
And if you remain established, obviously, then nothing that comes from others can invade

01:42.280 --> 01:43.800
you.

01:43.800 --> 01:51.360
I suppose I'm not understanding how one can remain established on the perception of

01:51.360 --> 01:54.440
no people when there are people.

01:54.440 --> 02:03.640
Yeah, well, the mind can, because people already implies absence of them as a possibility.

02:03.640 --> 02:08.840
When you actually went into the actual experience of that possibility of absence of people, you

02:08.840 --> 02:14.280
kind of had it validated, you've been dwelling in, you've been living in, you go used to it,

02:14.280 --> 02:18.360
you started discerning signs and tokens of such perceptions.

02:18.360 --> 02:27.200
Then you go among people, and you remain established upon the complete counterfeit absence

02:27.200 --> 02:29.200
of people.

02:29.200 --> 02:35.800
So you don't have to go to the forest to become another one, but it is certainly quite

02:35.800 --> 02:41.080
a suitable way to develop a mind, which is why the Buddha was so encouraging about it.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.280
And there was the purpose as well, forest means no others.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.680
You don't run away from them because they bother you, you feed them or ever know.

02:49.680 --> 02:54.080
You go there to develop such perceptions, so that then when you surround them by people,

02:54.080 --> 03:00.080
you want to make a difference.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.560
Some of the people use this for the forest because they don't want to deal with anything,

03:03.560 --> 03:09.520
so they feel like only I run away, but it is nothing to deal with, with others, more

03:09.520 --> 03:13.680
than others, although it would be great, but that's probably the wrong basis for doing

03:13.680 --> 03:14.680
such thing.

03:14.680 --> 03:22.600
So the perceptions we're referring to is like how it is that I know that I am in a forest,

03:22.600 --> 03:28.360
as opposed to how I know I am in a city, which is namely the absence of various things

03:28.360 --> 03:31.120
in the forest.

03:31.120 --> 03:36.160
But then, so maybe the confused and I was like, what does it mean to establish the mind

03:36.160 --> 03:38.160
on that reception?

03:38.160 --> 03:42.360
I think that I was talking that in a talk where the mind is not established, then it's

03:42.360 --> 03:43.360
an abstraction.

03:43.360 --> 03:48.760
If the mind actually matches the level of that phenomenon, then it's easy to be abstraction,

03:48.760 --> 03:54.200
and that's where the mind is established upon it, upon such notions.

03:54.200 --> 03:58.200
So I'll have to definitely revisit that talk.

03:58.200 --> 04:04.280
It's just not really clicking through how you're going to have establishments of perceptions

04:04.280 --> 04:10.240
of something that is not directly present, being perceived, but that's the thing, as

04:10.240 --> 04:16.280
I said, perceptions that tend to the senses, but also to the mind, thoughts of being perceived,

04:16.280 --> 04:21.440
the sixth sense, mono, and it's counterpart, thumb, images.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.680
So that's the main point.

04:23.680 --> 04:29.800
So some perceptions that you have, like your eyes, ears, nose, you start discerning more

04:29.800 --> 04:34.320
general perceptions, possibilities of such perceptions, and so on, which are all obviously

04:34.320 --> 04:35.960
on the level of the mind.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.680
That's why it's the establishment of the mind, not the establishment of the eye or

04:38.680 --> 04:40.680
the ear.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.280
And that's the main thing.

04:42.280 --> 04:48.640
So absence of people, it's almost present on the level of mind when you're looking at

04:48.640 --> 04:54.960
people, when you're surrounded by people, when you're eyes see people, as a remote possibility

04:54.960 --> 05:00.720
to that which is on the mental level, it's the absence of these very people.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.840
And that's where the mind gets established.

05:02.840 --> 05:06.560
So that's how you can look at people while the mind is established on the counterpart

05:06.560 --> 05:07.960
of the absence of people.

05:07.960 --> 05:13.880
You're not denying that they're not real, they're very real, but the mind does not descend

05:13.880 --> 05:15.920
on the level of the eye.

05:15.920 --> 05:21.360
It stays established upon the images, perceptions, then it has developed while in the forest.

05:21.360 --> 05:26.040
And then it recognizes as in that sutra, now while I'm established, while upon these

05:26.040 --> 05:28.880
perceptions of the forest, I can't be bothered by anything in the village.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.520
But I can be bothered by changes in the forest.

05:32.520 --> 05:37.760
So then he expands that, and then he establishes his mind upon the phenomenon of earth, an

05:37.760 --> 05:41.480
element of earth.

05:41.480 --> 05:49.040
Because again, element of earth as a remote descend, possibility is present in everything.

05:49.040 --> 05:54.960
And the mind stays on that while the experience kind of descends down on the more particular

05:54.960 --> 05:55.960
eye levels.

05:55.960 --> 06:07.400
So it's been quite a little more there, perhaps the separation that I think is important

06:07.400 --> 06:10.200
to clarify is what is the difference.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.520
Let's stay with the forest in versus the town for sure being.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.760
So I'm in town trying to add on perceptions of the forest.

06:18.760 --> 06:23.040
What's the separation between that and just kind of like not paying attention to daydream

06:23.040 --> 06:24.760
in that I'm in the woods?

06:24.760 --> 06:30.000
Well, that's when the mind ceases to be established, and then it becomes just daydream of being

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
in the woods.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.520
So it's in a matter of, at that moment, time might be attending to the woods in a particular

06:35.520 --> 06:37.520
kind of way instead of attending.

06:37.520 --> 06:42.000
If the mind is established, then you're properly attending to the perceptions of the absence

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
of people in the woods.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
If the mind is not then, yeah, then it's just fantasy.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.800
And then you won't be establishment and then you will not be impenetrable by the things,

06:52.800 --> 06:57.280
perceptions that occur in the city of the village.

06:57.280 --> 07:01.840
So that's when the mind, like you can still be kind of revolving on the same mental images,

07:01.840 --> 07:04.080
but the mind is not developed in regard to them.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.480
It's not established in regard to them.

07:06.480 --> 07:14.880
The mind has descended down where the eye is, where the ear is, nose and so on.

07:14.880 --> 07:23.440
The idea of having the mind on a quote unquote higher level made a little bit more sense

07:23.440 --> 07:30.480
to me, the idea that you can be, you know, talking to people while at the same time the

07:30.480 --> 07:35.760
mind doesn't necessarily have to get disturbed, yeah, disturbed by that.

07:35.760 --> 07:40.720
It's not an easy thing, but it's never going to stay for him, not at all.

07:40.720 --> 07:46.760
And that's what my development is in the sutras, samadhi, and all the other level here,

07:46.760 --> 07:50.240
establishes my perception of light, infinite space.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.240
It's exactly that.

07:51.240 --> 07:57.040
You can just take it to various degrees, all the way up to the cessation of perception

07:57.040 --> 08:01.040
and feelings.

08:01.040 --> 08:07.000
So, the same kind of establishment goes into play with, like, you know, you just mentioned

08:07.000 --> 08:13.720
perception of light, which is typically, you know, the end to the third end doing soft

08:13.720 --> 08:14.720
torpor.

08:14.720 --> 08:15.720
Yeah.

08:15.720 --> 08:16.720
Yeah.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.880
So, it's kind of the same idea you're saying of establishing the mind on a perception of

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
light.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.520
We're talking about light in terms of light, light, bold light.

08:26.520 --> 08:27.520
Light.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.520
A phenomenon of light.

08:28.520 --> 08:35.520
It's in day, which is in the dark, as the absence, which is in the light bulb, where I can't

08:35.520 --> 08:36.520
light.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.520
That's the thing.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.520
It's not a particular object that emits light.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.520
It's not staring into a light bulb.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
No.

08:43.520 --> 08:48.280
No, is it staring at the play disks to establish the mind upon the element of a light, which

08:48.280 --> 08:52.720
is what people do, to consider the pucks.

08:52.720 --> 08:59.720
I understand that there is a phenomenon of light that emits light, absence of light, but

08:59.720 --> 09:01.720
it's still a one-round light.

09:01.720 --> 09:02.720
Yeah.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.720
It's establishing the mind on that the same way that overcome sleepiness, somehow.

09:06.720 --> 09:07.720
Sure.

09:07.720 --> 09:14.920
Or to not own sleepiness, not without sleepiness, because sometimes the body might be genuinely

09:14.920 --> 09:15.920
sleeping.

09:15.920 --> 09:22.400
But obviously, if you take it up, then it becomes your sloth and torpor, but if it's not

09:22.400 --> 09:23.400
then it's just the body start.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.560
And then you might actually stay awake, because you realize what it is, or you might sleep

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
a very little.

09:28.560 --> 09:34.240
Or you might sleep a lot if the body was really tired, but you won't be sleeping out of indulgence

09:34.240 --> 09:50.240
in that sleep, and indulges in that ignorance, because the mind remains established.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.240
Right.

09:52.240 --> 10:01.720
We're about unattractiveness, perception, interaction, looking at the practice of 32 parts

10:01.720 --> 10:08.240
of the body, and the perspective of the body.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.240
Which takes away lust.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
Yeah.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.240
So you're not running on the aspect of beauty?

10:14.240 --> 10:15.240
You think so?

10:15.240 --> 10:18.240
So it's the same thing.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.320
It's the same body, same thing.

10:21.320 --> 10:27.640
That can be regarded in a manner of infatuation, with lust, or can be seen as actually quite

10:27.640 --> 10:28.640
impulsive.

10:28.640 --> 10:35.560
But because people have an inherent assumption of the value of pleasure, you just always

10:35.560 --> 10:42.000
automatically give your attention to the beautiful aspect of it, and you don't want to think

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
about what it being caused.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Gross.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.600
It's not, it's not nice.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.000
And that's what the last develops, right?

10:52.000 --> 11:01.720
So over the point, it's not just the stare at corpses or bodily organs for themselves.

11:01.720 --> 11:06.560
The point is to see those very things as things that you do regard as beautiful.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.960
So simultaneously, to see them as beautiful, these other things, and that will undermine

11:10.960 --> 11:17.960
the notion of beautiful, that usually grips the people's mind.

11:17.960 --> 11:23.480
To remind, we have always said that the dimension of the other mind is quite, I think, called

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
the master perceptions.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.480
Like you can see that beautiful in the mirror.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.480
Not really.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.480
Not really in beautiful sense.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.480
Yeah.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.680
It realizes that the potential for the perception is all in the zombies, which is a matter

11:32.680 --> 11:36.080
of which one is intended to.

11:36.080 --> 11:42.400
Because that's exactly the point, like in beautiful, there is the underlying ugly, because

11:42.400 --> 11:46.440
you can be regarded as a possibility of an ocean of ugly.

11:46.440 --> 11:50.800
And same, ugly can be regarded as beautiful in reference to something else.

11:50.800 --> 11:56.560
It's just that people's mind get gripped by the notion of beauty and loves to immediately

11:56.560 --> 11:58.880
invade it and spread it further.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.720
For an hour on, it's free from lust, heal him up.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.560
This is a beautiful object that he can see through as ugly.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.640
This is an ugly object that he can see through as beautiful.

12:09.640 --> 12:15.440
Either way, there won't be only lust in between the two of them in regard to it, but it's

12:15.440 --> 12:17.640
on a different level, I think.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.640
Yes, yes, yes, me if I'm wrong.

12:19.640 --> 12:20.640
Yeah, absolutely.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.640
It's not.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.640
Like, when there is beautiful, ugly is on the level of a possibility on it, which means

12:25.640 --> 12:26.640
it's more general.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.640
When it's ugly, its beauty is on the level of possibility.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.360
There is a single tenuous present.

12:32.360 --> 12:38.920
That's why the mind can be developed in regard to both, making the peripheral more present.

12:38.920 --> 12:45.240
Discerning the peripheral, while discerning the peripheral of the general ugliness, repulsiveness

12:45.240 --> 12:49.360
in regard to this particular beautiful thing that has a reason.

12:49.360 --> 13:03.720
I think there is another source, which is more ugly for beautiful world, doesn't it?

13:03.720 --> 13:12.120
Well anyway, I think you can infer that by yourself, if you just, as a whole, the world

13:12.120 --> 13:15.160
as a whole, you experience as a whole, if you look at it, you'll see, well, there are

13:15.160 --> 13:19.120
more ugly things, the more things that you don't want to look at.

13:19.120 --> 13:24.200
And then you know that we've always been selectively picking these particular things that we

13:24.200 --> 13:26.600
found beautiful.

13:26.600 --> 13:31.200
So ugly, but being more general, we'll always remain like a foundation for the beautiful.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.800
You know, you have to do is remove the last thing in regard to beautiful, and then that

13:35.800 --> 13:37.280
relationship becomes apparent.

13:37.280 --> 13:42.080
And then you, you know, you won't have to be staring at ugly things to remove your

13:42.080 --> 13:45.440
last thing, because you never removed it, you removed it in regard to beautiful things.

13:45.440 --> 13:49.120
So then it's just, if it's ugly, you know, it's ugly, it's beautiful, you know, it's

13:49.120 --> 13:50.120
beautiful.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.120
But again, there is no last thing in regard to it, because you know, within that, it's

13:53.120 --> 13:54.720
actually quite repulsive.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.960
Nothing is worth being lasted after.

13:57.960 --> 14:03.120
Do you have to intention to find the subtracted aspect?

14:03.120 --> 14:08.880
Well, the tetralation, yeah, yeah, because by giving in to the last thought, it's beautiful,

14:08.880 --> 14:15.120
you automatically maintain ignorance, ignoring of the other.

14:15.120 --> 14:19.240
Because if, if ugly in the beautiful are given at the same time, yeah, you will be repelled

14:19.240 --> 14:20.240
by both.

14:20.240 --> 14:26.920
So in terms of 30 points, he reviews his body from the totally negative souls of his people.

14:26.920 --> 14:33.160
Each, each part he reviews, he reviews it in relationship to the general notion of body.

14:33.160 --> 14:37.480
There is regard of his mind, there is regard of his beautiful, his strong, his healthy,

14:37.480 --> 14:40.160
his everlasting, and whatever else.

14:40.160 --> 14:44.600
He doesn't go through like systematically just listing organs for the sacred, listing

14:44.600 --> 14:45.600
organs.

14:45.600 --> 14:50.240
So when he's thinking about the organ of the eye, ear, nose, skin, nails, each of them individually,

14:50.240 --> 14:54.640
he thinks in relationship to the body as a whole.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.640
Why is it ugly?

14:56.640 --> 14:57.640
Which, what do you mean?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.640
Well, it's ugly because it's intolerant.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
Yeah.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
That's why it's ugly.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.640
That's why it's ugly.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
That's why it's ugly.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.640
Yeah.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.640
It's ugly.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.640
This is.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.640
Insult of it.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.640
No, no, no.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.640
Lost it after.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.640
It's not mine.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.640
It's.

15:11.640 --> 15:12.640
It's not mine, yeah.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.640
It's ugly.

15:13.640 --> 15:22.720
So you think it's not much, so much amount of liver is nasty looking, but it's just not

15:22.720 --> 15:23.720
accessible.

15:23.720 --> 15:24.720
Exactly.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.720
Exactly.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.720
Exactly.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.720
Exactly.

15:27.720 --> 15:33.520
And that's usually what a person would get when he encounters something ugly, something

15:33.520 --> 15:34.520
repulsive.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.520
Oh, I don't want this.

15:36.520 --> 15:42.760
So you start looking at the liver, at the brain, as I don't want this in relation to

15:42.760 --> 15:49.760
that notion of the body as a general thing.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.760
Oh, there.

15:53.760 --> 16:08.760
And that's often the problem that people would get with a super practice in meditation.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.760
It would be in the beginning.

16:11.760 --> 16:16.840
They might see the relationship between every individual part or a dead body or anything

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
that they're practicing.

16:17.840 --> 16:18.840
There's a contemplation.

16:18.840 --> 16:23.760
They might maintain the mindful relationship between the sense of their body, but that tends

16:23.760 --> 16:31.120
to kind of fall out, fall away, and then it's a sense of like trying to revoke disgust

16:31.120 --> 16:33.120
for the sake of disgust.

16:33.120 --> 16:37.800
But that's equally, can be equally misleading.

16:37.800 --> 16:42.400
I'm trying to think about a pretty girl and they're like, oh, she's made of organs.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.400
Yeah.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.400
Yeah.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.120
She is, but that's the thing.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.640
But you want to see actually that even you seeing the pretty girl, that which kind

16:49.640 --> 16:55.440
of precedes the sight of the pretty girl, is made of those unwanted and accessible,

16:55.440 --> 16:57.720
disgusting organs.

16:57.720 --> 17:02.800
And then there won't be any ground left for lust to kind of linger on.

17:02.800 --> 17:07.720
Neither in regard to the scene, nor in regard to that because of which there is scene.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.320
Which is a presence of this conscious body here.

17:10.320 --> 17:15.800
It comes back to preceding existence, structurally preceding it.

17:15.800 --> 17:20.160
And it's helped by understanding that lust becomes impossible.

17:20.160 --> 17:24.200
Not knowing that, that's the best for lust.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.520
That's when you refer to parasite.

17:26.520 --> 17:32.120
It's not supposed to be there, but it's there.

17:32.120 --> 17:38.200
It's been a few minutes because when I first started reading the bosom, you know, there's

17:38.200 --> 17:44.000
that one sutra, I think, Munchen and the Kaya, 119, if you're into the mindless of body

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
sutra.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Uh-huh.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
Talks about how you could use mindless body to even attain the bondage.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.400
I'm like, how could you do that one about the mind when you think about the body in this

17:55.400 --> 17:56.640
kind of way that we're speaking?

17:56.640 --> 17:57.640
Yeah.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.640
It makes perfect sense.

17:58.640 --> 17:59.640
Absolutely.

17:59.640 --> 18:00.640
Yeah.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.640
And that's why we were meant.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.640
It's called universe.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.760
It's contained in this body.

18:04.760 --> 18:09.800
Not in the scientific body, main of organ, but in this notion of body, this experience

18:09.800 --> 18:16.120
of body, which does precede things that I kind of infer from it, the world and the

18:16.120 --> 18:18.120
end of the world.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.120
Yeah.

18:19.120 --> 18:31.240
Is it you guys after the thirty-five somebody to expect the cork sensation in that same

18:31.240 --> 18:34.720
sutra by telling my time in the area?

18:34.720 --> 18:44.240
And, you know, you look at a body wrunching in various stages and then one says, you think

18:44.240 --> 18:51.000
yourself just that body is the same, this body will be the same, this body, just my

18:51.000 --> 18:53.760
body, this body will be the same.

18:53.760 --> 18:59.960
And there's a bridge that can seem to be as opposed to looking at the body parts.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.960
So what does that come down to?

19:01.960 --> 19:08.120
While you're looking at a decomposing body, you simultaneously regard this body as that.

19:08.120 --> 19:14.680
What is the level of a mental exercise in parents or so on, but basically by seeing, while

19:14.680 --> 19:17.640
I'm seeing this, this is that nature.

19:17.640 --> 19:23.760
This body shares that very nature and then the last is removed.

19:23.760 --> 19:31.280
But if it's not seen at the simultaneous level, so to speak, then it's not done properly.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.280
That contemplation.

19:32.280 --> 19:45.760
So the external body that's decomposing, it's basically the nature that is the nature

19:45.760 --> 19:48.880
of this which I regard as my internal body.

19:48.880 --> 19:52.240
That's the internal body, basically like that external body.

19:52.240 --> 19:56.320
That's where it's internal external, both internal and external.

19:56.320 --> 20:02.120
The body is there of such nature and you remove any, well, ignorance in regard to it

20:02.120 --> 20:08.280
and consequently, obviously, these are in the last, they would be lingering around the

20:08.280 --> 20:12.720
notion of pleasant and the beauty.

20:12.720 --> 20:17.120
And you're saying these are in the last, you mean that, like in the most broad sense?

20:17.120 --> 20:18.120
In the most natural sense.

20:18.120 --> 20:22.720
Not exactly in the last, yeah, just like people have these are in the last in regard to

20:22.720 --> 20:26.800
their own body because they pursue side sounds, melt their touches, which means you maintain

20:26.800 --> 20:30.560
the basis of those things, which is your very body, your senses.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.280
Because those things are on fire as well.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.880
Everything is caught up by the fire on lust.

20:36.880 --> 20:41.320
And that's why because you depend on the beautiful sights, your life revolves around it,

20:41.320 --> 20:47.160
you'll be terrified of the notion of losing your eyes, you'll figure out if I go blind.

20:47.160 --> 21:02.560
And it equals death, you think about the diseases, you can have, yeah, different things that

21:02.560 --> 21:04.840
could come into your way at any point.

21:04.840 --> 21:09.760
Just the fact that those things are possible means the body is liable at any time.

21:09.760 --> 21:15.240
The fact that the body is liable at any time means you're not in control because if you're

21:15.240 --> 21:20.320
in charge, you would remove death liable.

21:20.320 --> 21:25.760
Only something that you cannot control, you cannot own is liable to things you don't want.

21:25.760 --> 21:29.080
That's it's not yours for that very reason.

21:29.080 --> 21:38.560
But people don't dwell long enough on what body is liable to, to age, get sick and die

21:38.560 --> 21:43.360
because if they were, they would experience the special regard here and then the special.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.000
Oh, it's dangerous for me to remain regarded, this is mine.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.200
And like kind of establishing my entire life around it can be swept away with a simple illness

21:53.200 --> 21:54.200
next day.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
And that's it.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
Falling bolted.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.200
Falling bolted?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.200
Okay.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.200
Trip over a rock.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.200
Beating by a snake.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.200
Everything.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.200
Everything.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.200
Every heart stop.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.200
For no particular reason.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.200
And that's how it looked like.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
There you go.

22:07.200 --> 22:12.880
Many people start experiencing anxiety, attacks, whatever they become aware of that, beating

22:12.880 --> 22:13.880
up.

22:13.880 --> 22:14.880
And the chest.

22:14.880 --> 22:23.200
Because you realize your entire life, everything, dear to you, all your hopes, plans, experiences,

22:23.200 --> 22:30.280
whatever, depends on this completely independent, simple muscle pump inside your chest.

22:30.280 --> 22:38.520
You have absolutely no way of even controlling, contributing and just going to get involved.

22:38.520 --> 22:45.000
And if that stops pumping, that's it, everything is done, it's kind of swept away with it.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.240
So your whole life depends on something utterly, like a ticking organ, and you can't even

22:51.240 --> 22:52.240
conceive controlling.

22:52.240 --> 22:59.240
You have these videos of mine sometimes where a person's like an event or talking, something

22:59.240 --> 23:00.240
to kill over.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.240
It's brain enders.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.240
No.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.240
Same thing.

23:03.240 --> 23:14.440
Yeah, it's like the brain basically explodes, it's just done, it's blood, it's something

23:14.440 --> 23:15.440
to blood.

23:15.440 --> 23:20.920
And that's the nature of the body in general.

23:20.920 --> 23:26.520
I mean, we know because of the medical science that, you know, the heart is the kind of dominant

23:26.520 --> 23:32.520
pump that maintains it and so on, but overall, it's the nature of any aspect of the body.

23:32.520 --> 23:33.520
It's hard to control.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.520
It's on the same foot.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.520
So what do you regard the heart?

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
That's the unattractiveness.

23:37.520 --> 23:41.360
You know, what do you regard the heart, contemplate the heart, the brain, or the body as a whole

23:41.360 --> 23:46.360
in general, or just the notion of health and life as a phenomenon?

23:46.360 --> 23:47.360
It's all the same thing.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.360
It's the same contemplation.

23:48.360 --> 23:54.560
It's you're even moving by simply dwelling in the fact that you cannot be in control even

23:54.560 --> 24:01.280
if you want, which means it's not even possible to be in control of this, left alone after

24:01.280 --> 24:02.280
you're in control of it.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.280
So there's just some practices.

24:05.280 --> 24:15.280
I think we'll have a chance to say to one more, keep these pieces in a jar when you're

24:15.280 --> 24:17.280
thinking about it's broken, that hurt.

24:17.280 --> 24:22.280
You want to just worry about the child, but it's not this, which, you know, can be helpful

24:22.280 --> 24:28.520
with that person at the time, but that can seem to be practice, where you think about

24:28.520 --> 24:34.440
the stink, where there's an experiment, and really, those things which genuinely most

24:34.440 --> 24:45.520
you'll find, you've probably seen it, that's another level of the fact of non-control,

24:45.520 --> 24:46.520
rather than...

24:46.520 --> 24:53.120
Well, if a super is done rightly, it could lead to the dispassion which will become, and

24:53.120 --> 24:58.040
then they will reveal the novel, because it's really not in my control.

24:58.040 --> 25:02.680
So a super done rightly brings the clarity, and clarity of understanding, which is understanding

25:02.680 --> 25:04.680
that you're not in control.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.680
Not the discussed.

25:06.680 --> 25:10.840
Not discussed, and not like, oh, you do a super when you need to cancel the last, but

25:10.840 --> 25:13.840
you need to cancel the last, because you haven't included the last.

25:13.840 --> 25:17.920
So you don't want to revolve around just constantly managing the last, when the last arises.

25:17.920 --> 25:22.720
Sure, when the last arises, you manage it, only so that you can then carry on further

25:22.720 --> 25:27.040
and uproot it, so it doesn't arise.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.920
And if a super is done rightly, it will really lead to accruting it, but most people use

25:31.920 --> 25:37.040
it just as a management, and which means they're not using it right here.

25:37.040 --> 25:46.040
It's just like, yeah, they are there, we saw the bones, the meat, the meaty bones, the

25:46.040 --> 25:53.280
carnage, and then you get a sign of that meaty carnage, yes, the meaty bones, yeah, carnage.

25:53.280 --> 25:59.280
And I'm saying, it looks like just put you by a road accident, which is destroyed, shattering,

25:59.280 --> 26:03.280
and that's what this body is, that's what dog body is, that's what I was worried about,

26:03.280 --> 26:04.280
yeah.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.280
This joint is flesh.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.280
Yeah, that's it.

26:06.280 --> 26:12.480
So because of that, there is, as a sort of say, the conceiver and the perceiver, there

26:12.480 --> 26:19.640
is the mistake, because these things are reason, the senses, the sense organs, are the material

26:19.640 --> 26:25.400
things in the world, because of which one perceives and conceives the world, because obviously

26:25.400 --> 26:34.840
one perceives and thus conceives the demons, with non-desermot, with appropriation.

26:34.840 --> 26:42.720
So you can never, that perceiver and conceiver, can never access, well, anything but them,

26:42.720 --> 26:47.800
but most obviously cannot access any of the sense bases, because the sense bases are

26:47.800 --> 26:51.600
that, because of which there are side sounds from out there's touches, and then thoughts

26:51.600 --> 26:54.120
in regard to that.

26:54.120 --> 27:01.720
So you can't see, your eye can't see itself as that meaty, fleshy, oily, slimy, order,

27:01.720 --> 27:02.720
become.

27:02.720 --> 27:09.400
That's why by seeing other eyes, or other organs, or other material things on the same domain

27:09.400 --> 27:14.640
as not yours, you can then discern that this, which is similar to Mr. President, cannot

27:14.640 --> 27:19.360
be seen in the same manner, because it's always, in that sense it's always internal, or

27:19.360 --> 27:23.840
rather in that sense it's always this conscious body, where you can fully discern that it

27:23.840 --> 27:28.560
shares the same nature, and thus remove any lust and desire and appropriation in regard

27:28.560 --> 27:31.960
to it.

27:31.960 --> 27:37.200
But if you expect to see it as side sounds from out there starting, you want it, as if

27:37.200 --> 27:46.760
people get confused, with kind of salient in general, because they're always, in a way,

27:46.760 --> 27:52.760
they're negative, they can only be discerned in regard to the things that are positively

27:52.760 --> 27:53.760
arisen.

27:53.760 --> 28:01.360
Like you can see something and know the eye must be there, exactly, simultaneous with the

28:01.360 --> 28:05.120
sight.

28:05.120 --> 28:09.480
And even the knowledge of the eye is simultaneous with the domain, the knowledge of the domain

28:09.480 --> 28:11.480
of the sight.

28:11.480 --> 28:18.960
There's no time discrepancy, as if sense bases are there, and then things fall onto

28:18.960 --> 28:36.280
them and you'll perceive it, no.

28:36.280 --> 28:41.000
You mean perception of forest, as well, if you haven't, you would have to be in a forest

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
as well.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.240
Because if you haven't, then you stay in a forest, and develop perceptions over forest.

28:48.240 --> 28:53.640
And you don't actually do that up more often, those perceptions become clear.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.640
That's why I put it here.

28:54.640 --> 29:01.080
Go to the remote land, go to the forest, go to the woods, the trees, and so on.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.080
No others.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.080
Yeah.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.080
Because we're actually physically making that effort.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.920
You're putting yourself in such environment, a circumstance that with these perceptions,

29:06.920 --> 29:11.000
the mind will, well, adhere to them, eventually.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.120
Maybe not the first time, but if you know what you're supposed to look, what do, what signs,

29:17.120 --> 29:23.280
natural dispassion, inception around it, then the mind starts discerning, the perceptions

29:23.280 --> 29:32.520
of the forest, the perceptions of absence of people, absence of the common bases of

29:32.520 --> 29:39.040
lust, absence of the sense of abundance, sense of objective abundance, that they lie for,

29:39.040 --> 29:44.240
pleasing food, face, mouth, the absence of all of them, things that people usually lust

29:44.240 --> 29:47.640
after, absence of that, you won't find that in abundance.

29:47.640 --> 29:53.240
It was somebody who could go into wilderness, and the mind stayed in the city.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.240
Yeah.

29:54.240 --> 30:07.800
Well, that's the carefulness, the carefulness that comes from living in the forest, the attitude

30:07.800 --> 30:11.960
of being really careful about what you know, what you're just becoming natural.

30:11.960 --> 30:16.840
Because you're real, like, if you make a wrong step, you'd have to fly down the cliff,

30:16.840 --> 30:21.880
like when we were coming down the cliff, you didn't have to make the effort, like this

30:21.880 --> 30:22.880
mindfulness.

30:22.880 --> 30:28.240
You were just mindful, you just, every move, everything you leaned on, everything you

30:28.240 --> 30:35.720
grabbed, everything you put a foot on, you were just mindful, because you had to be.

30:35.720 --> 30:42.200
You are aware of your body, and the, the afflictions of your body, the basic, you have to

30:42.200 --> 30:47.040
grab food, shelter, certain warmth, health, nothing.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.040
Exactly.

30:48.040 --> 30:51.640
And see, there are those things that most often people take for granted.

30:51.640 --> 30:56.640
If we weren't taking for granted, you don't want to have to go to the remote forest and

30:56.640 --> 30:58.440
climb the mountains and so on.

30:58.440 --> 31:02.640
But it's so deeply rooted, it's so natural to take these things for granted once you

31:02.640 --> 31:03.640
have them.

31:03.640 --> 31:09.920
Then, yeah, you need these reminders to realize that actually, body, even a healthy, normal

31:09.920 --> 31:17.080
body requires a great deal of maintenance and protection and sheltering, which is actually

31:17.080 --> 31:18.080
a hard work.

31:18.080 --> 31:22.000
But obviously, living inside the city, the cities where these things are provided, you

31:22.000 --> 31:24.200
just take for granted because you don't think about it.

31:24.200 --> 31:28.080
All you have to do is just remove yourself and that's it, and then you realize what kind

31:28.080 --> 31:30.360
of maintenance it is.

31:30.360 --> 31:36.160
How exposed the body is, even it's, you know, even when it's at its peak, it's better

31:36.160 --> 31:39.800
still exposed, exposed to elements, exposed to energy.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.840
And you can't say, you can't shelter them, you can't build a house around it, because

31:43.840 --> 31:45.920
the house too is out on their level.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.160
What other the body is out with their dead houses as well.

31:49.160 --> 31:54.760
So it's just remains external, remains liable to all sorts of things.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.960
And you can't change that.

31:56.960 --> 32:01.460
You're right looking, you're speaking, but living in the house and sticking with your

32:01.460 --> 32:03.960
father and so on.

32:03.960 --> 32:14.560
There is a suitor, so I don't know, that's about this morning, about the forest.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.560
Uh-huh.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.560
Uh-huh.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.560
Venable Nagita.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.560
Welcome, crossing.

32:21.560 --> 32:31.480
It's, there's two suitors about Venable Nagita, and he's, in the ungood to me today.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.480
This is the one from the Sixers.

32:33.480 --> 32:39.840
They're both summoning in the beginning, but different teachings, and there's slightly

32:39.840 --> 32:40.840
different teachings.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.040
This is the one in terms of the forest.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.040
Yeah, that's, yeah.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.040
I was reading.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.040
Yeah.

32:46.040 --> 32:53.040
So, uh, one occasion of last month was one doing one tour around the coast and together

32:53.040 --> 33:00.640
with a large Sunday, and then you reach the coast and ramen village, uh, named Ichon

33:00.640 --> 33:01.640
Nangala.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.640
How does it call it?

33:03.640 --> 33:04.640
Gala.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.640
Ichon Nangala.

33:05.640 --> 33:06.640
J.

33:06.640 --> 33:14.680
The message went well in Ichon Nangala, uh, wooden thicket in the forest there.

33:14.680 --> 33:17.240
The brown householders there heard it.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.760
He said that they set a goat's mind, the son of the succulents who went forth from the

33:20.760 --> 33:23.520
second family has arrived at this town.

33:23.520 --> 33:26.920
There's not running in there, and the forest in the vine.

33:26.920 --> 33:32.640
Now, a good report about the most, uh, master goat's mind has circulated thus.

33:32.640 --> 33:39.640
That best one is at our end, perfectly enlightened.

33:39.640 --> 33:45.040
These teachings, the Dhamma, the teachers of Dhamma is going to be getting good in the

33:45.040 --> 33:46.040
middle and good in the end.

33:46.040 --> 33:49.040
The right meaning and phrase of the reveals is spiritual life that is perfectly complete

33:49.040 --> 33:50.040
and pure.

33:50.040 --> 33:53.240
Now, it's good to see such a round.

33:53.240 --> 33:58.440
Then with the mighty pass, the brown householders of their town took abundant food of various

33:58.440 --> 34:01.840
kinds and went to the forest.

34:01.840 --> 34:07.560
They stood outside the entrance, making an uproar and a racket.

34:07.560 --> 34:11.880
Now, on that occasion, the Renable Marbita was the best one's attended.

34:11.880 --> 34:16.880
The best one then addressed the Renable Marbita, who is making such an uproar and a racket

34:16.880 --> 34:17.880
Marbita.

34:17.880 --> 34:21.680
One would think it was a fishman at a whole with fish.

34:21.680 --> 34:28.280
There's a bunch of these are the brown householders of Ichananagaya, who have brought abundant

34:28.280 --> 34:30.120
food of various kinds.

34:30.120 --> 34:34.120
They are standing outside the entrance, wishing to offer it to the best one and the

34:34.120 --> 34:38.120
Sangha of Bikres.

34:38.120 --> 34:43.360
Let me never come upon Fain Marbita and may Fain never catch up with me.

34:43.360 --> 34:49.280
One who does not gain any will without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation,

34:49.280 --> 34:54.360
bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain in will without

34:54.360 --> 35:00.000
trouble or difficulty, might accept that mild pleasure, that slothful pleasure, that pleasure

35:00.000 --> 35:04.320
of gain, upon it, in praise.

35:04.320 --> 35:09.580
And may he do it lies, let the best one now consent about it, let the fortune of one

35:09.580 --> 35:10.580
consent.

35:10.580 --> 35:13.680
This is the time for the best one to consent.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.540
Wherever the best one will go now, the brown householders of town and countryside will

35:17.540 --> 35:23.120
decline in the same direction, just as when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the water

35:23.120 --> 35:25.160
flows down a lot of the slope.

35:25.160 --> 35:29.980
So too, wherever the best one will go now, the brown householders of town and country

35:29.980 --> 35:35.160
will be fine in the same direction for what reason, because of the best one's virtuous

35:35.160 --> 35:41.200
behaviour in the wisdom and the will and the keep repeats.

35:41.200 --> 35:47.120
Let me never come upon Fain Marbita, he's not consenting, may he never catch up with

35:47.120 --> 35:48.120
me.

35:48.120 --> 35:54.760
And he goes on to say, here in my Gita, I see a Bikres, dwelling on the outskirts of

35:54.760 --> 35:58.080
a village, sitting in a state of compulsion.

35:58.080 --> 36:05.080
And then it goes to me, now the monastery attendant, who are novice, who are co-religious

36:05.080 --> 36:12.160
in this co-religious, will cause that vulnerable one to fall away from that compulsion.

36:12.160 --> 36:18.640
For this reason, I'm not pleased with this Bikres dwelling on the outskirts of a village.

36:18.640 --> 36:27.080
I see Navita, a forest dwelling Bikres, sitting in dozing in the forest, and then it goes

36:27.080 --> 36:28.080
to me.

36:28.080 --> 36:34.080
Now this venable one will dispel the sleepiness of the tea and attend only to the perception

36:34.080 --> 36:37.400
of the forest, the state of the wonders.

36:37.400 --> 36:42.400
For this reason, I'm pleased with this Bikres dwelling on the outskirts of a village.

36:42.400 --> 36:48.800
Compose near the village with a client, because he's near the environment that is basically

36:48.800 --> 36:50.880
prudent.

36:50.880 --> 36:55.680
Non-compose sleep, he draws a lazy, but in the forest, well, eventually come out of

36:55.680 --> 36:59.880
that sleep, he draws a lazyness, and then develop a proper perception of the forest, because

36:59.880 --> 37:05.680
he still remains physically in the better environment.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.680
The state of wonders.

37:07.680 --> 37:13.000
Well, the state of wonders, basically, when the mind is established upon a more general

37:13.000 --> 37:18.240
thing, it's not diversified among more particular things that you get in the village.

37:18.240 --> 37:23.680
So it's a state of wonders in relation to that, and not the state of wonders that a tree

37:23.680 --> 37:26.680
hugging does and might consider uniformity.

37:26.680 --> 37:27.680
Yeah.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.680
Yes, actually.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.680
Yeah, exactly.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.680
It's not diversified.

37:30.680 --> 37:38.680
I see my Gita, a forest dwell in Bikres, sitting in the forest in that uncomposed state, and

37:38.680 --> 37:39.680
then it goes to me.

37:39.680 --> 37:44.680
Now this venable one will compose his uncomposed mind or guide his composed mind.

37:44.680 --> 37:49.680
For this reason, I'm pleased with this Bikres dwelling in the forest.

37:49.680 --> 37:56.680
I see my Gita a forest dwell in Bikres, sitting in the forest in a state of composure, and then

37:56.680 --> 37:57.680
it goes to me.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.680
Now this venable one will liberate his un liberated mind or guide his liberated mind.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.680
For this reason, I'm pleased with this Bikres dwelling in the forest.

38:05.680 --> 38:10.680
I see my Gita a Bikres dwelling on the outskirts of the village, who gained ropes, arms with

38:10.680 --> 38:15.680
lodgings, medicines, provisions for the sick, desiring gain, honour and fame.

38:15.680 --> 38:21.680
He neglects seclusion, he neglects remote lodgings in the forest and general pros, having entered

38:21.680 --> 38:24.680
the village's towns and capital cities he takes up his residence.

38:24.680 --> 38:29.680
For this reason, I'm not pleased with the Bikres dwelling in the outskirts of the village.

38:29.680 --> 38:34.680
I see my Gita a forest dwell in Bikres, who gained ropes, arms with lodgings, medicines and

38:34.680 --> 38:39.680
provisions for the sick, having dispelled that gain, honour and praise.

38:39.680 --> 38:45.680
There's not neglect seclusion, there's not neglects remote lodgings in the forest and general

38:45.680 --> 38:46.680
pros.

38:46.680 --> 38:50.680
For this reason, I'm pleased with this Bikres dwelling in the forest.

38:50.680 --> 38:56.680
When my Gita, I'm travelling on a highway and do not see anyone ahead of me or behind

38:56.680 --> 39:05.680
me, even if it is for the purpose of defecating and urinating, on that occasion, I am at ease.

39:05.680 --> 39:12.680
It's a praising forest.

39:12.680 --> 39:21.680
You're making the effort, there's not neglecting it, and then even if it's not perfect,

39:21.680 --> 39:29.680
even if a person is sleepy and lazy and tired or afraid, still, you still don't neglect it.

39:29.680 --> 39:36.680
Sooner or later, you come out there, and the environment is suitable as it is spoken

39:36.680 --> 39:37.680
in the previous.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.680
It's a great template.

39:40.680 --> 39:47.680
Yeah, it's basically, let's say, he goes into an empty heart, empty dwellings as this place

39:47.680 --> 39:55.680
is empty of others, and then he accepts the same phenomena than he applies to himself.

39:55.680 --> 40:02.680
This is empty of any self, so it's there as such, but it's empty of the owner.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.680
But you do need that physical incentive, so to speak.

40:06.680 --> 40:13.680
Your body needs to be such an environment, so you can have the right inference, not just

40:13.680 --> 40:19.680
like to think about it, but never abandon a crowd, or never abandon the proximity of the

40:19.680 --> 40:20.680
crowd.

40:20.680 --> 40:26.680
The engagement, the dependence, the relationship.

40:26.680 --> 40:32.680
Obviously, you know, you're not supposed to, and you don't have to, like, run away

40:32.680 --> 40:36.680
and hide from people and never see them again, because if they were the case, well,

40:36.680 --> 40:39.680
we would be allowed to stay around full-crow, around full, a little bit of a mountain,

40:39.680 --> 40:42.680
and never engage because they did that.

40:42.680 --> 40:47.680
But it was clear that no, living on the fringe and the outskirts, and then inspiring them,

40:47.680 --> 40:52.680
either with your lifestyle, or with the teachings, if they want to hear them, and so on,

40:52.680 --> 40:53.680
it's fine.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.680
But don't neglect the seclusion.

40:55.680 --> 41:06.680
Don't now, like, forget the remote forest of boats, and just 24-7 stay around late people.

41:06.680 --> 41:12.680
That's what means village, laylife, city, today, whatever.

41:12.680 --> 41:19.680
So, when it's there, if it occurs, it's fine, but you don't neglect the campfire.

41:34.680 --> 41:36.680
And you can see that for yourself.

41:36.680 --> 41:40.680
The more you go to the forest properly, the more you want to go.

41:40.680 --> 41:47.680
The longer you want to stay, because of that, that the template.

41:55.680 --> 41:59.680
Which is, yeah, as you say, dangerous, as well.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.680
Sure?

42:00.680 --> 42:01.680
Yeah?

42:01.680 --> 42:03.680
There is a real danger there.

42:03.680 --> 42:10.680
But I think the body is what's dangerous, not being in the forest.

42:10.680 --> 42:15.680
The only reason things in the forest might be dangerous, like the elephant, or a leopard,

42:15.680 --> 42:17.680
is because you have a body.

42:17.680 --> 42:23.680
And the danger will only pertain to you, as long as you're taking the body to be yours.

42:23.680 --> 42:32.680
So, experiencing the elements, heat, cold, wind, hardship, endurance, walking up the mountain,

42:32.680 --> 42:37.680
climbing up the rocks, and running away from an elephant.

42:37.680 --> 42:38.680
But not having.

42:38.680 --> 42:44.680
Experiencing those things, basically, with the right mind from this, just keeps hammering in,

42:44.680 --> 42:50.680
that the nature, the main characteristic of having this body, exposure,

42:50.680 --> 42:54.680
not yours, not in your control, it's out there.

42:54.680 --> 43:00.680
So, by going through with it, with the right mind from this, with the right view,

43:00.680 --> 43:05.680
you're removing any lingering lust, and the emotions of conceit,

43:05.680 --> 43:09.680
or bend it in regard to the body.

43:09.680 --> 43:19.680
Even, you know, even if you're not an old crooked man, something like that, you don't have to be.

43:19.680 --> 43:25.680
And actually, yeah, if you wait until you're old and crooked, you go back and you want it.

43:25.680 --> 43:30.680
You go while you can, so that afterwards, you can.

43:30.680 --> 43:35.680
Don't delay.

43:50.680 --> 43:55.680
Yeah, it's set up, the forest, you might be set up in my distraction.

43:55.680 --> 44:00.680
But it's not set up, yeah.

44:00.680 --> 44:05.680
That's the ultimate sort of difference.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.680
If you were to boil it down, there would be a difference, yeah.

44:08.680 --> 44:28.680
Distraction, non-distraction, diversify, unify.

44:28.680 --> 44:35.680
Again, that mosquito is a treat for it, there's no personal thing against you.

44:35.680 --> 44:40.680
Yeah, there's no personality, no interaction.

44:40.680 --> 44:45.680
You can put it on the mosquito, it's out to get you, but you know.

44:45.680 --> 44:50.680
It's not, it's not.

44:50.680 --> 44:53.680
Completely up and down.

44:53.680 --> 44:55.680
Impersonal.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.680
Impersonal.

44:57.680 --> 45:01.680
Indifferent.

45:01.680 --> 45:04.680
Leaches.

45:04.680 --> 45:09.680
Yeah.

45:09.680 --> 45:15.680
It comes back also, that idea that people's mind is going to fatalism with karma.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.680
Again, anything happens because of karma.

45:18.680 --> 45:20.680
Yeah, every single body.

45:20.680 --> 45:23.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.680
Having a human body happens because of karma.

45:26.680 --> 45:27.680
Yeah.

45:27.680 --> 45:31.680
But what happens is that a human body, well, is a nature of a human body.

45:31.680 --> 45:36.680
So indirectly, you're responsible to what happens to a human body because you were reborn.

45:36.680 --> 45:39.680
That's your responsibility.

45:39.680 --> 45:46.680
But accident is a valid reason for things to occur, circumstance.

45:46.680 --> 45:49.680
You're again, indirectly responsible, why?

45:49.680 --> 45:53.680
Because you remain in the possession of that human body.

45:53.680 --> 45:59.680
That is liable to accidents, reliable to absolutely random things happening to it.

45:59.680 --> 46:02.680
So you'll be affected by that for as long as you stay there.

46:02.680 --> 46:30.680
You reign it, it doesn't affect you, you're a problem.
