00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
How can I satisfy all my desires?

00:19.000 --> 00:25.760
By overcoming the nature of desire.

00:25.760 --> 00:33.760
It's very much related to the previous question that you had about suffering.

00:33.760 --> 00:41.760
Basically, what people deem to be satisfaction of their desire is the result of the desire.

00:41.760 --> 00:49.760
So by pursuing what you think satisfaction is, you cannot possibly satisfy the desire in the sense of making it go away.

00:49.760 --> 01:03.760
It only covers it up and feeds it more, because the desire is rooted in your mental attitude.

01:03.760 --> 01:09.760
Which means if you were to remove the desire from its roots, there won't be anything there to satisfy.

01:09.760 --> 01:19.760
There will be no pressure for you, no burden for you to have to chase and reach this goal and satisfy this displeasing feeling of an unsatisfied desire.

01:19.760 --> 01:26.760
But you can't, that's what people don't realize, you can't satisfy the displeasing feeling of a non-satisfied desire.

01:26.760 --> 01:32.760
You can only cover it up with a pleasing feeling of a non-satisfied desire.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.760
Desire remains unsatisfied.

01:35.760 --> 01:41.760
The goal of desire is not to be satisfied, the goal of desire is to perpetuate its own nature of being a desire.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.760
That's why whether you're resisting pain or giving in to pleasure, you're maintaining the nature of your desires.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.760
So you remain bummed by it.

01:51.760 --> 01:56.760
So if I want to go on holiday today, I can't, I want to go on holiday to the Caribbean or something.

01:56.760 --> 02:01.760
Yes, you can either suffer because the circumstances are displeasing and you're trying to change them,

02:01.760 --> 02:06.760
or you can remove your desire to go to the Caribbean and then you're at peace.

02:06.760 --> 02:35.760
Because you don't want to go into first place.
