1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So it's about the ownership of a sense of self, that's your mistake, not the existence of your sense of self.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But usually people who jump into conclusion, ah, no self means there is no self.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, who is then talking and deciding and making all these choices?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And then if actually said I read in the suitors carefully, the Buddha never said there is no self.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But actually people ask him, so his master got them as saying there is self, and he'll be quiet.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ah, so master got them as saying there is no self, and he'll be quiet.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because either way, for this person self is already there, ownership is already there, and he can't see the ownership.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And that's where the problem is.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, do you feel like you're your own?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How come?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Because I cannot control my...

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, in hindsight when you think about it, sure.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But say something that you wish for comes your way.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you happy and elated and accountable?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Something that you don't wish for comes your way.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Are you said about it?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Means there is ownership in regard to the senses that can experience these things.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So then you can't say, oh, I don't regard myself as my own.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You might wish to not regard yourself as your own, but practically facts are showing you that you do,

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
because you still are liable to suffer and feel on account of changing things.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And that's really the problem.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's all about denying things, denying yourself.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's just gratuitous ownership that we exercise over our own senses.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And if you want the weather, you're exercising ownership, and I'm just asking yourself,

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
would I suffer if something changes that I don't like?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If you wouldn't suffer, means, okay, I'm along the right path.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's why that self-honestly needs to become first.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
When the weather said person needs to understand, there is good action, there is bad action,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
there is a good result, bad result, there is the given, there is this, there is the practice.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Because if a person is denying all of that, then exactly, they wouldn't necessarily see where the problem is

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and where to apply their effort.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then it would be like, oh, there is no self, so what is there for me to do anyway?

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, there is no self, you can say that, but there is suffering.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're still liable to suffering, and that's what you need to do.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And once you start doing that right, you get to understand, that's what it would have meant by not self.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's what the suffering is, not any kind of random theoretical scientific sense of experiment that proves that nothing's real and but not.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Because when he approached the first disciples after his enlightenment, they asked him, oh, what teaching?

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And he didn't say, oh, I'm telling you, there is no self.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He just said, there is suffering, and I'm teaching freedom from it.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Because that's something that everybody can universally relate to.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
When he met the man before that, in the same suit, when he was going down the road, and this man sees me,

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
oh, you look very bright, very composed, who's teaching did you follow to develop those faculties?

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And he said, I follow no one's teaching.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm my only leader.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm the supreme ruler of humans and gods.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm the best, which is pure fact.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Nothing conceded about it.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But in this man's eyes, through his own conceit, all he could see is like, I am the best.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I was so beat and left.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I didn't want to hear the rest, what I'm going to have to say.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So clearly, by the time the Buddha reached these other disciples, he realized if he approaches them with a sense of,

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know what the truth is, they're going to be undefensive.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But he does know what the truth is, but people won't hear it.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So then he related that which they can relate to internally, which is, you're liable to suffering.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Even if you don't necessarily suffer, you are liable.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And eventually you will have to, old age, sickness, death, inevitable.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I'm teaching freedom from it.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I was like, oh, okay.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Like, oh, yeah, I want that.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And that's how they start to listen to him.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Although they tried to dismiss him first, because he wasn't part of the group anymore.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Anyway, that's it.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So that's, in answer to the question, there is no self, there is self.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But you should try not to own it.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because you can just say, oh, there is no self, there is both, there is neither.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Factually, you remain liable to suffering and you don't know the way out.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And that's the core of the teaching, suffering and freedom from it.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And that brings me to practice of matter.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, you want to ask yourself, why do you want to do it?

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why are you doing it?

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's the purpose of imitations?

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Personally, I want to focus myself.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That is my main thing.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And what would be the purpose of that?

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
To calm my mind.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And what would be the purpose of that?

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why do you prefer a calm mind?

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Again, yes, free of suffering.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Because a non-calm mind bothers you.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So why go a round way about it when you can start thinking about what makes calm mind calm?

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Or what disrupt the mind?

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Does sense desire disrupt the mind if you want something that you don't have?

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Does somebody say something upsetting and you refuse to let go of it?

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Does that disrupt the mind?

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So you realize you don't need to do meditation to calm your mind.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You need to stop disrupting it yourself with your own choices and actions.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then meditation comes out of that.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Usually people hear about meditation and they use it wrongly in a sense of,

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you try to replace issues with matter.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like, oh, if I do matter, it will come in place of this.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But the place of your problem is not in things.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The place of your disturbed mind is not in because somebody said something upsetting to you.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's because your mind got upset when I count something that's being said to it.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And you can't replace that.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can only train it to not do that anymore.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And then you realize, I don't need to suffer, I made suffering.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's what Buddha said if the mind is developed.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You would endure the unpleasant harsh insults, words, attacks,

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
in the same sense you endure wind, cold, sun, like elements.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Completely nothing personal about it.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But you take the ownership of it and it's automatically personal.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And then you don't have to deal with it.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And then you hear about matter and not use specifically.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Everybody does by that.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And then you hope, if I develop this meditation, someone's meditation will push this whole thing out

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and I will never be able to get angry or something like that.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You get angry by giving into anger.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You get lustful by giving into lust, by making choices based upon it,

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
by having non-restraint.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because that's what's in common, by the way, to pursuing sensual desire,

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
acting out anger, acting out of carelessness is lack of restraint,

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
lack of self-control.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So then you could draw a line and say that, oh, so your mind gets disturbed

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
when you don't have enough control over yourself.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And that's entirely up to you.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Nobody can control you for you.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And people don't have enough control over themselves

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
because they don't think enough about it.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They expect circumstances to control them,

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
whatever tradition, duty, values.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And they do to some extent, but you want to take it on a new level

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
whereby you take control of your sensory strength,

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
of your verbal actions, of your physical actions.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's already the beginning of wisdom.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Five precepts will then take it for a rate, precepts and so on.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So we have to always start with the five precepts.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Not just you have to start.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You always stay within them, by the way.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Like, even when you start practicing meditation,

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
then you don't do it, it's within the five precepts,

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
so you just continuation of the same principle.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Of that sense of non-disturb mind that comes from controlling your actions.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's why literally, in its core, the Buddha said,

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
he teaches action and freedom from action.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And action is already a choice.

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's already on a level of an action.

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hey boy, it's okay.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's okay, man.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you think he wants to go out?

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, I think he's just strangers in his space.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He wants to let you know the boss is.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, yes, he is.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, he's not used to it.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, I mean, like, you have to be very disciplined

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and following precepts and all that

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
before we can actually develop wisdom.

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, that's already the beginning of wisdom.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a mistake to separate it.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a mistake to think our wisdom will then come after it.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Doing that is already the beginning of wisdom.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Because you're already becoming transparent in regard to your own motives.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Where your intentions and choices are rooted.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And then you would know, little, this isn't wholesome.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Like, this is rooted in completely unskillful desires in me.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The world can praise it.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They can say, this is a great thing to do.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You have so much passion.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But from the standpoint of wanting to have a mind that is calm,

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
you realize, no, this is incompatible.

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can't have that.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And the reason why people have entertained these things is because they don't.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They don't accept.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They don't look at it.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They're not transparent.

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They don't know it.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Because everybody wants to have their mind calm.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Even people say they don't.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They do.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's why you always pursue pleasure and stuff.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because it's satisfaction.

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's already a form of calmness.

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And that's what people have dependent on it.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because they don't know any other type of satisfaction.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Except, like, central satisfaction or satisfaction.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Real will and retaliation and so on.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So, my question is, if the Buddha intended to not be worshipped as a god

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
or any part of his musical self idolized as a Buddhist,

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
is it acceptable to visit places like the lot of Maligawa

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
to worship his sacred tooth or Adam's tooth to worship his footprint?

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The thing is, not all people do their...

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And neither Buddha is going to do their practice for the same reason.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So, if you visit Maligawa because it will just remind you of the Buddha

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and the possibility of enlightenment, that's fine.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And the Buddha did say, yeah, when they're asking, what should we worship when you die?

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There were no statues.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And he said, make no statues of me.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He was only came later with the Greeks when they came to India.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But he got quickly established because it's easier for people to worship

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
something that resembles a person or rather than these symbols

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
that already require a degree of wisdom and recognition.

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
However, the Buddha did say you can worship the symbol.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Like, by the body tree, they will remind you of enlightenment.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You might think about enlightenment.

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You might spell something in you that you maybe want to do it.

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You should worship the sign of an arms ball, which means there's a possibility

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to give up the world and be renounced.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then to see the reminds you of the teaching and so on.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So, it's all these symbolic things.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Just they might make somebody think about a dharma.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And that's it. That was the sole purpose of worship.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But nowadays, most people worship out of superstition.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And there is absolutely nothing to do with Buddhist teaching or Buddhism.

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But that is what Buddhism is today.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Whatever the other religion is today.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's firstly superstition.

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And then within that, those who are interested in modern superstition

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
get to find out the teaching.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So, if you visit Maligava so you can pass your test exams,

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
it has absolutely nothing to do with anything that Buddha taught.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you visit Maligava because you want your wishes to come true,

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
again, it's completely misplaced.

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you visit, because another way of misplacing it, if you think you can visit shrines

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and somehow get closer to enlightenment simply by physically visiting, you know,

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
stupas and whatnot, there's absolutely nothing to do with it.

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The enlightenment can only come with the self-restraint, understanding and wisdom.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And so, in that sense, this can be helpful.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You get inspired maybe and then you want to read the Buddhist teaching.

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Once you visited some statue or something.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But it's a very remote sense.

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I often come to people who think, as long as you worship,

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you're somehow getting closer to nibana.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And that's just wishful thinking.

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That is how it is presented.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, of course, because it's much easier than if I tell you,

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
no, you need to be perfectly restrained.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You need to give up things you like.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And sometimes in you, the things you don't like.

231
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You don't want to hear that.

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Only few people can hear that and accept it.

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So, it's easier for me as well to just hear.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's just very respect and challenge this.

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You'll be fine.

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You'll be able to do nibanas and all that.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I wonder what they say about Amisupu Jain,

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
what they thought they were in those days.

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
In his teachings.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Nothing.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Nothing.

242
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He said about alms and being generous.

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Not just amongst, but in general.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's like making money.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But that's not bringing you closer to enlightenment.

246
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They're just bringing you closer to a more wholesome mind,

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
better rebirths and so on.

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But in enlightenment, you need to abandon it all.

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You can't like give your way in terms of gifts to enlightenment.

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It doesn't work like that.

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And that's the problem.

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's not a problem that you don't necessarily pursue enlightenment.

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But the problem is when people then intentionally develop a view

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that, oh, I don't need to pursue it.

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And I can do this.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And by doing these random things, I'm somehow also getting closer to it.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And because of that, you never really admit to yourself

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
that you're not getting closer to enlightenment

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
just by random acts of generosity.

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And even good karma when you accumulate so many.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's still karma.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It is still karma.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's the whole point.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's what I mean.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He teaches action and freedom from action.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And action is good action and bad action.

267
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So, yes, you need to replace bad action with good action.

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But now you need to abandon that as well.

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you really want enlightenment.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And for that, you can't have like good action

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
somehow resulting self-cancelling action

272
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and you become fully enlightened on a hunt.

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Because, literally, we will just prescribe.

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Give this, give this, give this, and you'll be enlightened.

275
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But it didn't.

276
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Never.

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It has to come within anyways, right?

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Somebody cannot.

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Like somebody can write you.

280
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's why he himself says whatever is to obtain,

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to be obtained by the manly effort.

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I've done it.

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And that's why it cannot be taken away.

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because you do it for yourself.

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It doesn't depend on the external factors.

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's not given to you like, you know,

287
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
sudden divine providence.

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's just no.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It doesn't come that way.

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So, in that sense, that's what I mean.

291
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If you're clear as to why and what for,

292
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and keep clarifying if you're not clear,

293
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
then you get to realize what you really want.

294
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And then you get to do it properly as well

295
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
without misconceiving it.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And you might be fine.

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Like, god, man, look, enlightenment seems too far out of my reach.

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But let me then focus on things that are not without my reach.

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That the Buddha himself, who might respect enough to follow the teaching,

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
said, a layman should do.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But it's where layman, like, especially in the West,

302
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
or who it is for 20 years practicing,

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and they don't even keep the presets.

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Doing meditation retreats and stuff,

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
still drink alcohol and it's like, no restraint.

306
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And as I could see, the contradiction you're living

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
is because of your own ignorance.

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No one else's fault.

309
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But if you were to make the effort,

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
instead of having a wishful thinking of your genres and whatnot,

311
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
focus on what you are first and perfect that.

312
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then you see whether you're happy with it,

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
or whether you will come among,

314
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
or commit your restaurant to retreat.

315
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But they want to have it all at the same time.

316
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, I can also practice for enlightenment.

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I can also, you know,

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
have my desires as a layperson and so on.

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So you have to pick one.

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You have to recognize what your situation is

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and take responsibility for it.

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

324
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Because that's what I mean.

325
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If you renounce the world,

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
it's because you chose to do so.

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If you don't renounce the world,

328
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
it's because you chose to do so.

329
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There's no external authority or criteria

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
that demands from you to stay layperson or not.

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's purely my choice.

332
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah.

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But every choice means you're responsible for it.

334
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And that's the bit that people try to avoid because it's unpleasant.

335
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
See, if I accept responsibility

336
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
that I'm not renouncing the world,

337
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
means I have to accept responsibility for anything

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
that comes at me from that world that I haven't renounced.

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I have to accept responsibility for anything that results

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
out of my unenlightened mind.

341
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I can't complain about it.

342
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Because I choose to remain in the environment

343
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
where these things can happen.

344
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And that's not easy to bear necessarily for everyone.

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So people would then try to kind of mask that.

346
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And then at the same time,

347
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
develop a sense that,

348
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
but no, I am still practicing renunciation

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and everything while I'm not really.

350
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So you just need to learn how to be really, really,

351
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
even brutally honest with yourself.

352
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Nobody else.

353
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What are you doing and why are you doing it?

354
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Same.

355
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I want to meditate.

356
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Why?

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why?

358
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Why?

359
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Why?

360
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Because I don't want to suffer.

361
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So how do I suffer when I don't meditate?

362
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Not necessarily.

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Do I suffer when I act out unwholesomely?

364
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh, that's the root of my suffering.

365
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So let me deal with that,

366
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and then maybe meditation will become more obvious later.

367
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But for people,

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
as I said,

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
meditation becomes extension of what I want fulfilled for me.

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And that's why I want work.

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Not in the manner released.

372
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Okay.

373
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So I have a question that I was thinking about.

374
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So I was wondering,

375
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
how do you decide what is a comfort or something

376
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that you need to give up?

377
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Because I have some of my questions,

378
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
so also another part I was thinking about

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
was the use of technology inputs

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
like phones, for example.

381
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Is that allowed?

382
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is that not if you were pursuing the path of enlightenment?

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Those are tools.

384
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay.

385
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's not tools are not necessarily wrong.

386
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's the purpose of the use.

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So if you use your phone to cheat,

388
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
steal, engage in sensuality,

389
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
spread hate, it's wrong.

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But it's not the usage of the phone that's wrong.

391
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's your intention and your action

392
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
that's being acted out by the phone.

393
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If you use the phone to Google the suitors

394
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and read the translations online,

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
it's of course not wrong.

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If you use the phone to communicate when communication is needed,

397
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it's not wrong.

398
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If you use the phone to just chit chat random gossip,

399
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
it's wrong, but again, not because of the phone,

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
but because of the intention behind your action

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and what you're doing.

402
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So that's why it's not like,

403
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it's not prescribed.

404
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Like, you know, you have those Christian orders where you shun

405
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
or you must shun anything new and stuff.

406
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Not at all.

407
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's the tool.

408
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You mustn't shun your responsibility for your actions.

409
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But people try to like throw away the tools

410
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
because then they will blame the responsibility

411
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and the tools.

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
See, it's the phone's fault.

413
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's the internet's fault that I can't be restrained.

414
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No, it's your own fault that you're not restrained.

415
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay, so technology is okay in the lab.

416
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Exactly.

417
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's why you're using your fault.

418
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It always defines whether it's right or wrong.

419
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah.

420
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So that's why it can't be a blanked one.

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No, technology is absolutely fine or it's absolutely wrong

422
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
because people will use it for different purposes.

423
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Same, like knives, folks.

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You can use the harm somebody with it.

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Right.

426
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Or you keep very practical.

427
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can't survive in the wilderness without it.

428
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So.

429
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay.

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So another question I had was,

431
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
okay, so the concept of, you know,

432
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
reincarnation and good karma and bad karma.

433
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So, you know, I guess, like,

434
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
if my understanding is correct,

435
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
when you accumulate good karma and bad karma,

436
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
it goes, I guess, in terms of when you're being reborn,

437
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
in terms of, you know,

438
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
how you'd be reborn into your next life, essentially.

439
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How do you, like, so my question is, I guess, essentially, like,

440
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
how about this current life?

441
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Like, how do you end suffering when you're in the present?

442
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Right.

443
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, yeah, that's the point.

444
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you were to approve the desire from your mind

445
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and concede, you would be approving any basis for suffering.

446
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay.

447
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So.

448
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's how you do it.

449
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay.

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But that's something you can't do in a sense of just perform.

451
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's something that you can't just be generous,

452
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
pay your way to your life when you're just generous,

453
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
or something, because that's just another level of doing.

454
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So that's what I would say.

455
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
First, you need to be very sensory-strained.

456
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You need to keep the presets and restrain your desires

457
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and only recognize things that, okay, I, you know,

458
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I need to give into this or something like that.

459
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But not like, as a blanket mode of being,

460
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
whereby you always say yes,

461
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and then only sometimes say no when you can't get what you want.

462
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's out of the way around.

463
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's more like, no, I'll keep myself in check only when I can't,

464
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but even then means I'm responsible for it.

465
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's the first step.

466
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There has to be, to fully accept that you are responsible.

467
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
See, people think they suffer because things are unpleasant,

468
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
but you don't.

469
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You suffer because you resist the displeasure that you feel.

470
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So suffering itself is a concept.

471
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Pain is not suffering.

472
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Right.

473
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Resisting pain by default is suffering.

474
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's, that's why the craving is the root of suffering,

475
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
not feeling is the root of suffering.

476
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay.

477
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So if you want to be free from suffering this life,

478
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you have to stop craving, stop resisting, stop indulging.

479
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Right.

480
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What you feel right here right now.

481
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay.

482
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And the first step is to stop acting blindly

483
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
on account of what you feel right here right now.

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Right.

485
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Then you get to round up and see, okay.

486
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So you're not acting by the body, you're not acting by the speech,

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and then you get to see how your mind is affected by what you feel right now.

488
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And that's where the craving is, in your mind.

489
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But you cannot prove the craving in your mind

490
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
while your physical actions are still very much engaging.

491
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Okay.

492
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And rooted in that same craving.

493
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay.

494
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So suffering itself is like how you, how you perceive something

495
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
or how you, how you conceive and how you conceive something

496
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and that is what causes, brings you that stuff later, right?

497
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes.

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's slightly more immediate than that though.

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay.

500
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's literally when you are touched by disagreeable,

501
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
your mind automatically leans away from it.

502
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Right.

503
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's the default.

504
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay.

505
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
When you're touched by agreeable, your mind automatically leans towards it.

506
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Right.

507
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And is that leaning is the root of suffering.

508
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh.

509
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Not being touched in the first place.

510
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay.

511
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's why in the cases of fully enlightened monks,

512
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
you know, something they got attacked under the road and stabbed and stuff,

513
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and they didn't suffer on account of it.

514
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It doesn't mean they didn't feel the physical discomfort on account of it.

515
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
They did.

516
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
They did, right.

517
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But you realize that was never really the problem.

518
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The problem was you're not being able to not lean towards or against

519
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
when you're touched by a feeling.

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay.

521
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And you couldn't do it because you haven't understood it.

522
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And that's why the sensory strain needs to come first because by default,

523
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
people would first and foremost blame the external world for whatever they felt.

524
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
See, I feel the suffering because such and such person upset me.

525
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
No, such and such person had something to say disagreeable to you,

526
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
but you leaning away, trying to get the radio, trying to override the

527
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
disagreeability in you, that's your suffering.

528
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Not what they said.

529
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But if you never look in that direction, you'll remain blaming them

530
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and then feeling justified in hating them and so on.

531
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So first that needs to be restrained and then you get to understand what the problem really is.

532
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah.

533
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I think I have one more.

534
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So do you love any one of these thinking?

535
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't know.

536
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I was just wondering, so I was just thinking,

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,000
how can I make sure to use the full path and I'm such in my daily life?

538
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Like making sure the five precepts also make sure that I follow the right action and the right speed.

539
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Well, within the five precepts, that's only the type of right action.

540
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So you can follow five precepts by the body and follow them by the speech

541
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and then you can extend the same practice on the mind.

542
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And that's exactly, that's kind of the order you can develop as well.

543
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You can't extend them on the mind while your body is not restrained.

544
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But usually people associate a precept or just a bodily commandment or something like that.

545
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
They're principles that you need to start applying first onto the body.

546
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But then yes, so you're not obviously killing anybody physically,

547
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
but you might have harmful thoughts that you're harboring and detaining, thinking intentionally.

548
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You will not act, you will not harm physically anybody,

549
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but you might be gossiping or slandering somebody out of the same ill will.

550
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It would result in someone else's committing killing.

551
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So then you realize, so yeah, I'm obviously keeping the five precepts on the level of the body,

552
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
but why don't I restrain my mind from thinking bad and harmful thoughts towards others?

553
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So you use the same principle of five precepts and restraint

554
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
by applying it now on an even more accurate level, which is the level of your mind.

555
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So even if you're not drinking, stealing, cheating, lying and so on,

556
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
but am I thinking about these things?

557
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Am I thinking thoughts that are rooted in the same basis

558
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
that result sometimes in cheating or stealing, getting what I want on account of, you know,

559
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
sort of screwing up others and so on?

560
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Am I thinking thoughts that are just unrestrained, sensual?

561
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Am I thinking thoughts that are maybe not sensual but careless, harmful to me, to others,

562
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and they're not doing on that mental level either?

563
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Because it is a choice as well, it's just most people are not aware of that choice

564
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
because they're not even aware of the bodily choices they make.

565
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But once you start restraining that, these will become more obvious.

566
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Okay.

567
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So the key essentially is to start by controlling those atmospherically

568
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and then moving on to the mind.

569
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah, and then the mind will become apparent within those physical restraint that you just created.

570
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I got it.

571
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So it's like trying to tame wild dogs while they're still wild.

572
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You know, if you keep trying to chase them or something, good luck.

573
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You never know it.

574
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So you first put up a fence.

575
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You round up a perimeter and then within that you get to see, you get to learn about it

576
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and then become more familiar with it and then they start to listen to you.

577
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But most people won't arrive at that stage of like full control,

578
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
commanding the senses in the mind without even having set up the basic fence around the behavior.

579
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And then they hope like somehow meditation will magically bridge their gap.

580
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Right.

581
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh, I don't want this religious sign of restraint and whatever.

582
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Just teach me meditation and enlightenment.

583
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Right.

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I mean, even when the Buddha died, there's all these other hands,

585
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
like 500 fully enlightened monks came together.

586
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And so let's re-decide the teaching so that it gets remembered.

587
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And then they said, well, what do we recite first?

588
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
We recite our rules, patimaka, sensory strain, presets or do we recite dharma first?

589
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And you would think, of course, you recite dharma says no.

590
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
There is no dharma without the basis of rules.

591
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So we must recite the rules first.

592
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So they called one who knew all the rules and he recited all the rules and how they came to be.

593
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And only when there was completely exhausted.

594
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay.

595
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Now let us recite the words of the Buddha himself, not before the rules have been recited.

596
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So if the other hands needed to follow that order,

597
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
if the fully enlightened people needed to follow that order,

598
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
what is to say for somebody who's just starting their practice?

599
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's not optional.

600
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah.

601
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Most of the time it is the other way around.

602
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Are you completely?

603
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yes.

604
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I know the West especially.

605
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because in the West people don't even have the traditional kind of imposed values

606
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and anything vaguely religious, it's dismissed as a religious oppression.

607
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Right.

608
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So you can't even talk about restraint without them associating that with like, you know,

609
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
crazy Christian times, you know, 17th and 18th century in Europe,

610
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
but it's just like you kill people who don't keep commandments,

611
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
which is against the commandment, but the irony was lost in them, I guess.

612
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So, and then they hear like, you know, the esoteric Buddhism, whatever else,

613
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and then they hear meditation and they think, oh, if I just get the right meditation,

614
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that's it.

615
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't need to deal with anything else.

616
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And, you know, sometimes you have all these other schools of Buddhism like later on that came.

617
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
They're very much cater to that.

618
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, you don't need this.

619
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
No, no, no.

620
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You can be married and be a monk.

621
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You can do this and be a monk.

622
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You can do the ambient light.

623
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And it sounds like one of those fake adults that you can have it all for 199, you know.

624
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And it's just, but people believe in it because they want to believe in it.

625
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Because it's easier.

626
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And they are comfortable.

627
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Of course.

628
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, exactly.

629
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And they're like, oh, I need to give anything else.

630
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's so difficult to achieve.

631
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah.

632
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah.

633
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
But that's what I mean.

634
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You might realize that it's not that difficult if you actually start accepting responsibility

635
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
for what you already are doing.

636
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's nothing out of the audience.

637
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's just because you ignore it.

638
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You keep it in this project and now I can't pass on.

639
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No, wait.

640
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Wait, wait.

641
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Let me accept this first and then I'll see.

642
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Maybe I can get more.

643
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Maybe I want more.

644
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So you get to learn as a result of it.

645
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Okay.

646
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Can I ask a question?

647
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
How long have you been in your life?

648
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
15 years.

649
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
15 years?

650
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
2005.

651
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I started as a layman but a couple of years before that, like reading the sutas and keeping

652
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
the presets.

653
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And you were always interested in that?

654
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No, no, no.

655
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
One of us was 22.

656
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Okay.

657
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Before that I was very much not interested in any of that.

658
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Any of that.

659
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah.

660
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But at the same time I was becoming dissatisfied with just a genetic, you know, sensual lifestyle.

661
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And I got interested in meditation as every westerner does without religion.

662
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Right.

663
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But I had like nobody really like to ask for Buddhist groups.

664
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Nothing.

665
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And not really other religious groups at the time.

666
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Certainly not in my city.

667
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So I was just going to go to a library and read the books.

668
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Religion and philosophy.

669
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So I was reading everything.

670
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Hinduism and yoga, all sorts of things.

671
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Christianistics, everything, everything.

672
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And nothing was...

673
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

674
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And then I came and exited across the book of Yugoslavia monk in Sri Lanka in the 60s.

675
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And then he translated the actual sutas.

676
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And yeah, I read the first sutas of suffering, freedom, liability.

677
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And I had that recognition that, yeah, my life is really good.

678
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I was actually working for an American company more money than I can spend.

679
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Absolutely no problem with that.

680
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But at the same time you recognize you are liable to things changing.

681
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I could not ignore that.

682
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, I could all work out for the best.

683
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Okay, well if it doesn't.

684
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You see people around you, it doesn't always work out for the best.

685
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But you just pretend that your life will always be the best manner you want yet.

686
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So I was just becoming aware of the fact that there was nothing particular bothering me,

687
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
but I was becoming aware of the fact that some things could bother you.

688
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And you won't have a control over it.

689
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And there was beginning to bother me.

690
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That recognition.

691
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So then I sort of wind down my lifestyle.

692
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Big by bit.

693
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I saved up some money and went to become one.

694
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And because that's the thing I felt responsible.

695
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh, I don't have to become one.

696
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's not an imperative.

697
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But if I choose to stay in this life, whatever, in 30 years time,

698
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
if things that I don't like happen to me, it's on me.

699
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Because I chose to stay.

700
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Because now I know there is a way out, in terms of what is teaching,

701
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
but I chose to not follow it.

702
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because I'm now responsible for whatever stages are the result of not following the way out.

703
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Some people decide to stay, but to me, there was not a right choice.

704
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Doesn't mean it was easy to leave.

705
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But it was, yeah, it felt like a duty.

706
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Something we're doing.

707
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I understand impermanence in like a logical way.

708
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Exactly.

709
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But my parents are older, and I don't think they are going to be around too long.

710
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
How do I prepare myself to, I mean, I know, like, I know, like...

711
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Well, no, that's not a knowledge.

712
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Like, that's information.

713
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You have information about impermanence, but you have no understanding of it.

714
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Because if you truly understand impermanence, it results in the removal of any ownership you might have

715
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
over your parents and your own life.

716
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But you still have the ownership because you still feel that you're liable to suffer, exactly.

717
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Which means you haven't understood impermanence then.

718
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So you need to understand impermanence by starting, like, not in that logical manner,

719
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
but realize that, like, what you're currently feeling now, right here, right now,

720
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
whatever, good or bad or neutral, doesn't matter what it is.

721
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's already something that's not in your control.

722
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And you don't need to go into, like, psychological and scientific explanation

723
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
as to why it's not in your control.

724
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It doesn't matter why.

725
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The fact is that it's not in your control, yet you are acting as if it is in your control.

726
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I mean, did you have any say in your parents getting old?

727
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It's even inconceivable as an abstract thought to have a say in it.

728
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yet here we are acting as if it shouldn't happen.

729
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So, again, you can continue acting like that, and that's where you remain liable

730
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
to when those things happen, remain liable to being affected by them.

731
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Or you can start uprooting those gratuators' wrong views.

732
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah, but that's what we're going to say.

733
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You just watch your nostrils and you become an iron.

734
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And here you reflect on the nature of things, the nature of your actions, the nature of your choices.

735
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Think about it.

736
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because by thinking about it, you stop ignoring the obvious that you're not in control.

737
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And people ignore the obvious because lack of control from the point of view of control is very unpleasant.

738
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's anxiety and fear and all of it.

739
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But it's only so because you completely ignore it and then only sometimes it's thrown on you.

740
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But if you actually start thinking about it in a measured manner and stop ignoring it,

741
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
it will cease to scare you.

742
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Because you realize, well, when I'm afraid not, this is the factual state of affairs.

743
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's when I was saying that this morning to one of the monks, that's when the Buddha died,

744
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
some monks were not fully enlightened.

745
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
They were like, now what will happen now?

746
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But the monks, they were enlightened.

747
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
They were saying, of course, how can that which was born not die?

748
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I mean, for them, it became inconceivable to grieve over it.

749
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's madness, in a way.

750
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
How can you, like, they couldn't fathom it.

751
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
How can you grieve over it?

752
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Over something that's obviously have to go.

753
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yet people grieve over things that have to go.

754
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And they know they have to go, but they still grieve over things.

755
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Why?

756
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Because you ignore the fact that we will go and only address it when you have no choice about it.

757
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Same, like contemplation of, you know, I'll get old, I'll get sick.

758
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And that's why I'm going to say that you are responsible for that, because you keep yourself

759
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
pretty much intoxicated, like a drunk man, with life, with health, and with youth.

760
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You know it will go away, but you don't think about it.

761
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And by not thinking about it, you intoxicate yourself with it while it's present.

762
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's why a healthy man always thinks he'll be healthy.

763
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And even when you think about non-healthy, you think like in a second person manner,

764
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
not like something that directly applies to me.

765
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Because if I start thinking, no, no, no, it's this health, it's this youth, you're going to feel that.

766
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And, you know, you're so used to avoiding what you feel, or only chasing what you want to feel,

767
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
that by default you will be turning away from it.

768
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So that's why we'll compare the practice of dummies going against the grain.

769
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Now, against the string.

770
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Not like denying everything, but basically seeing the things are rooted and then stop ignoring it.

771
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
By not ignoring it, you see the origin of this.

772
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, I'm intoxicating because now I'm healthy, but do I have even say in this health?

773
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Who knows, I might be having cancer growing in me or something like that.

774
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You get scared.

775
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Well, the only reason you got scared is because you refuse to think about it.

776
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's like the most certain thing, by the way, when you think about it.

777
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Death.

778
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
As soon as you're born, it's absolutely a must.

779
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Everything else is optional.

780
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yet the most certain thing is like the last thing a people's mind.

781
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Because they choose to put it last and keep it last and press it there to be last,

782
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because it's too unpleasant to admit it.

783
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But if you train yourself towards that unpleasantness, it won't be unpleasant anymore.

784
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's only unpleasant because the dog chases you only because you start running away from it.

785
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
If you stand your ground, it won't chase you.

786
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It won't even attack you.

787
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But if you give in to the run, it will go after you.

788
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And that's exactly.

789
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You start giving in to avoiding this, and that's how it goes after you.

790
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's okay.

791
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's okay.

792
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's okay.

793
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's okay.

794
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's okay.

795
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's okay.

796
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's okay.

797
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's okay.

798
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah, we're all good questions.

799
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Mm-hmm.

800
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Mm-hmm.
