00:00.000 --> 00:29.800
So, these are a few questions, and I've got this one, and I've got this one, and I've

00:29.800 --> 00:45.400
got it up. I have been celibate for some time, and now have the fear that I will lose it.

00:45.400 --> 00:52.920
My mind is full of fear and has no peace. Yet peace is what I expected to get from celibacy.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.920
What am I doing wrong?

00:55.920 --> 01:06.920
Well, you get peace from losing desire towards sensuality. You don't get peace for celibacy

01:06.920 --> 01:14.000
if you still value sensuality. So, celibacy is a necessary prerequisite to lose the desire

01:14.000 --> 01:20.920
towards sensuality. But if you don't work on that part, mental part of your attraction

01:20.920 --> 01:26.840
to sensual objects, celibacy will free you and give you. Well, it will give you certainly

01:26.840 --> 01:33.400
a less disturbing life, a less engaging life, less entanglement in life, not engaging physically

01:33.400 --> 01:40.480
with sensuality. It's factually less entangling. But yes, if you still value sensuality, value

01:40.480 --> 01:50.120
sensual objects, saying no to them will hurt. So, did that person expect celibacy to do

01:50.120 --> 01:56.920
the work for him? So, if I'm celibate, if I just abstain from this, sensuality will

01:56.920 --> 02:04.040
magically evaporate from my mind. Or did they also on top of that sensory strength, virtue,

02:04.040 --> 02:09.280
celibacy, then make the effort to see the peril in sens objects, to see the peril in

02:09.280 --> 02:17.800
desire. If not, then the peace they were hoping to get on account of celibacy alone, it's

02:17.800 --> 02:22.240
kind of on the level of sensual satisfaction again. They were hoping that they will have

02:22.240 --> 02:29.080
this pleasure of a peaceful experience because they're not engaging sexually anymore. But

02:29.080 --> 02:32.960
that's not how it works. That would be too easy. That would be too easy. Just be celibate

02:32.960 --> 02:37.200
with that said, you're an out of hand. But no, you have to be, you want to be an out

02:37.200 --> 02:43.920
of hand. But in and of itself, it will not result in the unshakable peace. But factually,

02:43.920 --> 02:50.520
as I said, it will still result in less entanglement. So, focusing that on the benefits

02:50.520 --> 02:57.040
of doing it, don't just hope that it will do the work for you while you mentally still

02:57.040 --> 03:04.960
value the sensual objects. So, once you're celibate, are you now spending your time contemplating

03:04.960 --> 03:13.160
the danger of sens desire, the lack of satisfaction, the context of entanglement and disentanglement,

03:13.160 --> 03:18.480
the value of this entanglement? Are you making the effort on that mental level now that you

03:18.480 --> 03:23.480
created the basis through celibacy and virtue? Or are you just celibate and then just sort

03:23.480 --> 03:33.520
of threading water, just waiting for the work to magically be presented as completed?

03:33.520 --> 03:39.440
It's similar to someone who is like just doing, taking on the rules, taking on certain

03:39.440 --> 03:44.960
reasons and then hoping that. Yeah, okay. So, I understand now my duties to be celibate,

03:44.960 --> 03:52.200
okay, I'm celibate, okay. So, where's the peace? It won't come as a result of it because

03:52.200 --> 03:56.920
you haven't taken it rightly. You take celibacy so that you can tame your mind. You don't take

03:56.920 --> 04:01.720
celibacy because that will do the work for you. So, remind yourself for the reasons

04:01.720 --> 04:07.120
you're wanting to practice, keep that context, work on it. It's again, it's the similar

04:07.120 --> 04:12.040
of light in the sticks, you have fire sticks, light in the fire with the sticks while you're

04:12.040 --> 04:19.800
in the water. So, you can then, you realize, I have to come out of this river in order

04:19.800 --> 04:25.240
to sort of rub the sticks to get the fire. But if you just come out of the river and

04:25.240 --> 04:30.440
you make no effort to rub the sticks to light the fire, well, you won't get the fire. You

04:30.440 --> 04:33.880
still won't get the original result that made you come out of the water. But you have.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.720
But you have to come out of the water. So, that's a celibacy. It's not optional for

04:37.720 --> 04:42.280
somebody who wants to practice really for the results. But then, once you celebrate,

04:42.280 --> 04:49.160
that's not the end of the practice. Coming out of the water, yeah. Now, learning to

04:49.160 --> 04:53.840
light the fire and making the effort to dry the sticks, not soak them, not keep them in

04:53.840 --> 04:58.720
touch with water, even if you're out. In other words, stop valuing sensuality, stop hoping

04:58.720 --> 05:05.920
for some degree of central pleasures after I become peaceful and so on, you have to say

05:05.920 --> 05:11.080
no to that entire domain. And you would say no, not by kind of all just decide to say

05:11.080 --> 05:15.760
no, but by contemplating the factual danger of it, the factual lack of satisfaction,

05:15.760 --> 05:21.840
the factual perpetuation of the problem and on peace. And that in and of itself would

05:21.840 --> 05:27.960
be enough, actually, to already start seeing the benefits of being celibate, for example.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.600
And the dangers of not. And the dangers of not. Even if you don't get some higher results,

05:32.600 --> 05:41.280
you still recognize, well, yeah, it's still factually. And more freedom comes that way.

05:41.280 --> 05:52.680
So a question that's related to this. Now that I'm old, celibacy is quite easy. All

05:52.680 --> 05:59.520
of my previous passions have faded and now I dwell equanimous to most things. Most, but

05:59.520 --> 06:06.040
I fear that sickness and death will still be suffering for me. What should I do next?

06:06.040 --> 06:12.160
I think what should I do first is more likely, or you should ask, because celibacy and freedom

06:12.160 --> 06:18.440
from sensuality does not come with old age by default. As I said before, it goes underground

06:18.440 --> 06:23.480
with old age by default means you think now it's not there, because it's too far gone

06:23.480 --> 06:31.320
to see it. And the reminders of it still being there are like hard to spot because,

06:31.320 --> 06:36.480
you know, the vitality, the strength of the senses, the zeal, it's gone. It's just tired

06:36.480 --> 06:44.280
to trade it. But the attitude, the assumption of what where the last is, where the attraction

06:44.280 --> 06:48.840
is, where the desires are being satisfied, that's still there. And that's now much harder

06:48.840 --> 06:56.280
to see and uproot. Because if the person then gets sick, if the person is truly economist,

06:56.280 --> 06:59.760
then losing the prospect of losing the body even more.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.480
Exactly. If you truly practice celibacy to its fulfillment, i.e. abandoning of central

07:04.480 --> 07:11.200
desires, a prospect of sickness and death would not be frightening at all. And you would

07:11.200 --> 07:17.040
not even be doubtful about it. Because that, which is going to be wiped away with sickness

07:17.040 --> 07:23.520
and death, is that which you seemingly have no desire towards anymore.

07:23.520 --> 07:28.200
So now your senses that you're still very much bound with are even more invisible. Remember

07:28.200 --> 07:31.960
we spoke in previous talks, senses, sense organs that are always like negative, that

07:31.960 --> 07:37.560
a negative space in regard to what you look, see, smell, taste, touch. So it is defined

07:37.560 --> 07:44.200
in return by sight, sound, smell, taste touches. That is how you can infer and discern that

07:44.200 --> 07:52.760
organs are there. Now, since sight, sight, smell, taste touches have been bombarding

07:52.760 --> 07:58.360
you for decades and decades and decades and fatigue and you have no more inspirational

07:58.360 --> 08:05.520
strength and like joy towards the pleasures, you just tie it. You just rather not be bothered

08:05.520 --> 08:13.240
means your negative spaces of your senses will be even more invisible now. Because they're

08:13.240 --> 08:18.160
factually not being as defined as before, which is what people confuse as peace. Oh,

08:18.160 --> 08:25.040
look, I'm not disturbed as much as I was before. Yeah, because you can't know it. But if you

08:25.040 --> 08:28.520
truly want to see if you're peaceful or not, well, contemplating losing the dear ones,

08:28.520 --> 08:34.040
the loved ones, experiencing misfortune, can you still experience things on account of

08:34.040 --> 08:40.160
or of any kind of anything that could happen to this body, sickness, aging, paddles of

08:40.160 --> 08:46.640
that kind, would you equally remain unperturbed if you live a dying next moment? If not, means

08:46.640 --> 08:53.280
Oh, okay. So you missed the opportunity to approve the dependence on the negative sense

08:53.280 --> 09:00.560
organs, negative spaces of the sense organs. So now it's going to be even harder. So I

09:00.560 --> 09:06.680
guess what you could do is again, spend every minute of your life contemplating the value

09:06.680 --> 09:13.840
of virtue, sensory strain, practice generosity. Don't give rise to thoughts of ill will,

09:13.840 --> 09:22.880
thoughts of harm. Don't give rise to the sense of false complacency and safety. One account

09:22.880 --> 09:28.240
of things not disturbing you much. And then if you were truly free, you have nothing to

09:28.240 --> 09:33.440
lose with all these practices. If you were not truly free, well, you were really soon

09:33.440 --> 09:39.680
enough with all these practices. Because also eating, a person could take on certain. Yeah,

09:39.680 --> 09:47.040
yeah, the reasons for the eating practice increased moderation in eating to put it that way. Because

09:47.040 --> 09:52.240
that's still something that people really get into pleasure from. Yeah. I can't have this

09:52.240 --> 10:02.120
sexual part anymore. Sure. But sounds, food, food, comfort, physical comfort, being sheltered

10:02.120 --> 10:07.400
from the elements. And I don't mean like, you know, go and live outside blizzard or something,

10:07.400 --> 10:15.080
but how soft is your bed? How soft are pillows? How warm are your blankets? All of that,

10:15.080 --> 10:20.520
the purpose is one and only is to bright comfort for the body, for the sense organs that you

10:20.520 --> 10:25.320
still are. So would you be disturbed on account of losing those things? An account of maybe

10:25.320 --> 10:32.760
saying no to a degree and sleep on a harder bed, without a pillow. How miserable you'll

10:32.760 --> 10:39.600
be next day if you didn't have proper night of comfortable sleep. So you can still practice

10:39.600 --> 10:44.160
within that, even if you waited, because you know, there was that old lady, a whole past

10:44.160 --> 10:53.840
80 or whatever in the suitors that was had what I think two sons, husband, lots of wealth,

10:53.840 --> 10:59.920
husband passed away. She thought, Hey, why don't I give my wealth to my two sons and

10:59.920 --> 11:04.240
their families? And they look after me. So she gave all of her wealth, house everything

11:04.240 --> 11:09.160
to the two sons. And then from, you know, she was spent time with one, then going to spend

11:09.160 --> 11:14.560
time with the other. And on one occasion, when she was like that, arriving at a one sons

11:14.560 --> 11:18.560
house, before she could she overheard him saying, Oh, there she is coming again. Like,

11:18.560 --> 11:22.480
well, she has the other son, doesn't she, you know, the wife complaining or something.

11:22.480 --> 11:28.120
So she was heartbroken. The fact that they actually started despising her when she factually

11:28.120 --> 11:33.040
gave it all away. So he left, she left, saw the nuns getting sheltered in the food. I

11:33.040 --> 11:35.840
thought, Well, how might this will become an answer? I can at least have someone to sleep

11:35.840 --> 11:41.280
and eat. So she didn't even want to practice. She was old. She couldn't go pin the butt

11:41.280 --> 11:47.920
because she was old. She was just would clean up the place when the younger nuns go pin

11:47.920 --> 11:52.760
the part prepared everything when they bring the food. She was just like a servant there.

11:52.760 --> 11:58.520
And once she overheard one nun talk to the other about the some aspect of the dama that

11:58.520 --> 12:02.960
they heard from the Buddha. And then at night when she finished all of her chores, she couldn't

12:02.960 --> 12:07.240
even do the walking meditation straight, because she was old. She was walking up and

12:07.240 --> 12:13.360
down the corridor, propped with against the wall and contemplating what she heard. And

12:13.360 --> 12:21.240
she became out of hand. So it is still possible. But you do really have to commit to it like

12:21.240 --> 12:33.800
it is your last chance because it might well be for a long, long time.
