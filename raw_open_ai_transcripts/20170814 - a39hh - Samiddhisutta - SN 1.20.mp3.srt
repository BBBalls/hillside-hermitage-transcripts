1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,700
Let's call it the samadhi suddha, the first book of the samyut and the kaya, David the samy

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,700
faya.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,700
Let's see.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,540
So I had one question, particularly on one passage, but I think I'm just going to see the

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,540
whole thing.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,940
Some good things might come up as that's okay, so that's what I heard.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,940
So when I came in, a blessed woman was doing a raja in the hot spring park in the

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,060
venerable samidhi, having risen to the first flesh of dawn, went to the hot springs of

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,060
the day, having bathed.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:50,100
Then, when the night advanced, certain dayvata approached him, having approached, she stood

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,780
in the air, and dressed the venerable samidhi in verse, without having enjoyed, you seek

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,980
alms, be cool, you don't seek alms, after you've enjoyed, first enjoy be cool, then you seek

13
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:12,020
alms, don't let the time pass you by, he responds, I do not know what the time might be, the

14
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,860
time is hidden and cannot be seen, hence without enjoying, I seek alms, do not let the time

15
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,860
pass me by.

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,860
So it's kind of like a twospeck, I guess it means like the day is just telling me, enjoy

17
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,860
what you can.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,780
Yeah, it was a common belief as well, you enjoy sensuality and to get old, then when you

19
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,420
can't get much from it, then you go for even today, you see that.

20
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,180
Oh yeah, but that's all in the assumption that you may not live forever, or you're going

21
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,620
to live at least reach an old age, but even that's not a guarantee, so that's what

22
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,180
man said, well I don't know the time, I might die tomorrow basically, don't have the time

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,180
exactly.

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Exactly.

25
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:10,180
So after that exchange, the David that goes on, you have gone forth for a young, a light of

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,940
black hair, and that was blessing of youth in the kind of life without having doubted

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,620
those sensual pleasures, enjoy human sensual pleasures, cook, do not abandon what is directly

28
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,380
visible in order to pursue a takes time, he responds, I have not abandoned what is directly

29
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,220
visible in order to pursue a takes time, I have abandoned what takes time in order to pursue

30
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,940
what is directly visible, but the blessed one's friend has stated that sensual pleasures

31
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,340
are time consuming, full of suffering, full of despair, and the danger in them is still

32
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,940
greater, while the Dhamma is directly visible immediately, inviting one to come and see

33
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:57,220
applicable to me personally experienced by the wise, so it's kind of like saying that

34
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:05,100
even like, you know, seeing the Dhamma, practicing renunciation even, it just happens there

35
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,100
right now instead of going out and finding it through all the work.

36
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Well, in the first business, the Dhamma has been timeless, but it literally is visible directly,

37
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:27,100
not involving time, obviously going forward into the ordaining and in the part of the

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,380
Armstrong, whatever he is doing, that takes time, but that's not the Dhamma, the actual

39
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,980
thing of the Dhamma is the most direct visible thing, one can develop, which is why it

40
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,980
can abroot everything else, it does involve time, such as sensuality, but it still takes

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:51,220
in a sense, practice of Dhamma takes time, but Dhamma doesn't, because it's all there.

42
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,660
Well, exactly, it's simultaneously present basically, for as long as your aggregate's

43
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,660
present, so it doesn't pertain, it abroots the aggregates, it doesn't depend on them,

44
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:08,660
like everything else, which you do, there would be all time.

45
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,660
So then the day it says confused, how is it that the blessed one in the state, it's sensual

46
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,660
pleasure like that, how is the Dhamma like that?

47
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,940
So many says, I knew your Dhamma not long gone forth, you cannot explain in detail, but

48
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:30,260
the blessed one going here, you can ask me about this matter, David's elements, it isn't

49
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,340
easy for us to approach the blessed one, as he is surrounded by other than, David says

50
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:43,620
it's a great influence, so somebody says, okay, I'll go ask and you come along with me,

51
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,700
so he goes to the blessed one and reports the entire discussion, and says that this is

52
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,700
where it gets kind of interesting, but more interesting, not the last part was interesting.

53
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:05,940
Let's see, the David doesn't ask, somebody to ask the blessed one, I was writing that

54
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:13,460
conversation, and the blessed one says these two verses, beings who perceive what can be

55
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,380
expressed, become established and what can be expressed, not fully understanding what

56
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,660
can be expressed, they come under the depth, but having fully understood what can be

57
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,900
expressed, one does not conceive one who expresses, for that does not exist for him by which

58
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:39,820
one could describe him, so this even a long time ago struck me as a two verses very kind

59
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:47,900
of full of meaning, and it was only recently, only got into discussing things like, you

60
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,860
know, designations and stuff, it's kind of like, oh, it's kind of clicking, isn't it?

61
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,900
Yes, it seems like to be the first, that which is expressed, that which can be designated,

62
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,660
you can just hope that it says the same, to basically the extent of the name in regard

63
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,260
to the matter, which is the extent of the all.

64
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,580
So the issue is not perceiving what can be expressed, it's going to be everyone, but it's

65
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,900
becoming established.

66
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:21,340
Yeah, assuming, developing assumptions of POMDAT, which is expressed, whether it's like

67
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,540
the different types of conceivings in and out, apart from a different and the same, doesn't

68
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,460
matter, it's in regard to it.

69
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,020
So that's the problem there, but the name is never a problem, there never was, never

70
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,380
matters, not that the issue is not in there, so for example, sometimes people try to deny

71
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,820
the designation, try to deny the name, and then you may be, well, I'm sure you heard

72
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,620
that in America, I heard a lot of it in England, from people among saying, oh, it's just a

73
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,420
conventional reality, conventional truth and all of that.

74
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,380
Yeah, yeah, it's like, well, you can designate whichever you want it, it's a present experience

75
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,620
and it's really such.

76
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,900
So a conventional reality, and again, there is also a quite a serious contradiction

77
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,140
containing that, but they're not worried, when you say, there's just conventional reality,

78
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,940
as opposed to the ultimate reality, well, you just designated the ultimate reality in the

79
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,380
same manner you designated the conventional reality, which means ultimate reality is also

80
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
conventional reality.

81
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
Well, do you mean by the same way?

82
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,740
Well, do you name it, how are you calling it, oh, it's inexpressible, are you just

83
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,780
expressive, by calling it inexpressible?

84
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,860
So the any way of relation will be relation through name and matter, that it can't be

85
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,100
the other way, but people then want to replace name with something greater than the name

86
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,860
and the day used to it, but it's greater only in relation to what they're used to.

87
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,100
After a while, that would be the conventional norm.

88
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,500
Yeah, the context I usually heard the most regarding self, like, you know, they'd say, oh,

89
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,820
you know, we'd talk about myself, they're just convention, the other reality is there

90
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,820
is no self.

91
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.

92
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,820
And that's what your self is at the time, so it's all the denial of self.

93
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:13,420
It's a very cruel angle, yeah, but it's, yeah, very, very cruel.

94
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,860
Becoming established in what can be expressed, basically means assuming it for a stop, making

95
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
assumptions.

96
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,380
Yeah, yeah, bottom line, that can result in that.

97
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,220
Well, in this use, which is a cost, you can deny, you can say that second, you can say

98
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,820
that's, primary, you can say that's not real, you can say that's real.

99
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,700
All of those things are, when you refer to that name, to that which can be expressed apart

100
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,940
from yourself, basically, you leave yourself, you become the center of the expression.

101
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,500
You become defined by it, by sort of placing the attitude of assumption upon it, whether

102
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,300
like this or like that, both denied it doesn't matter.

103
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,580
One matter is yourself is assumed, separate from it, independent of it.

104
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:04,540
So that's fundamentally what assumption means, and why it's a problem and b, why it allows

105
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:15,460
for self-view to be fielded, because an assumption like that is such that ignores one's self,

106
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
so to say.

107
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Yeah.

108
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,620
So like, for example, the one I thought about a lot is guarding, you know, matter, I would

109
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,620
think of all, you know, right?

110
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:30,420
It ignores, it ignores, not a set of one's self, it ignores the ownership of one's self.

111
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,420
Like as you just said, people can say, there is no self, so they can really think about

112
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,540
it and not self, but they own that.

113
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
That thought.

114
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,500
Yeah, which means that's where their self is, self is where the ownership is.

115
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,100
It's like, receiving not self with self.

116
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Exactly.

117
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Yeah.

118
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,820
So like, for example, we could say the same thing with the matter, like, conceiving or assuming

119
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,420
about the matter of those two parts.

120
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,740
Well, conceiving, you can regard as subtler than assumption, but it's the same movement,

121
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
so to speak.

122
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
Right.

123
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
So conceiving is a result of assumptions.

124
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,140
When there are assumptions, means conceiving are there, then, yeah, you can be free from

125
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,980
course assumptions, is to have some conceiving of a subtle nature, but that's like, anagamiara

126
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:23,300
and sort of, yeah, we're about that later.

127
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:30,180
So like, if that matter, then, for example, we can have the assumption that, oh, the thought

128
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,540
I have of matter is that actual matter, that's an assumption.

129
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:41,260
I guess what's not very clear to me is, okay, I can make that assumption, but how is

130
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,860
that connected to my view of myself?

131
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:54,100
Well, by, see, by conceiving the matter, in such manner, by giving it a being, here we

132
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,380
can deal with, by giving it a being.

133
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,380
Yeah.

134
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,740
That's what you're responsible for, but matter is, by you thinking that thought is what

135
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,980
the matter is, means that thought that you had, that you think the matter is, is what

136
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,780
matter is, in your experience, you don't have the real, reference to real matter, or,

137
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,580
well, almost a real matter, as opposed to that standard, that's real, your assumption

138
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,420
is real, your assumption is real as such, and it's what, how matter exists at the time

139
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:34,740
for you, so you gave the being, that's what matter finds footing, so you give the being

140
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:43,420
to the matter, through the assumption, that's what, that's what the, uh, upadhanapache

141
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,260
baab, baab, direct result of your assumption is, how things exist for you.

142
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,180
And I know you wrote a whole essay on this, but this is of course different from things,

143
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:02,460
like, what's the worst, it like matter is, but that's different from saying that there

144
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:13,500
is being, from assumption of matter, baab, well no, that's what matter is, like, you, you

145
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,060
thinking now, oh, there is, there's my assumption of matter, and then there is real matter,

146
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,020
there is no real matter for you, whenever you think matter, you assume matter, the only

147
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,140
way you cannot assume matter is to stop conceiving it, and then that experience would be, the

148
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,660
experience of like, uh, the five aggregates free from upadhanapache, but now you, you still

149
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,300
think that you have a clear thought of what matter is, but you fail to see that that

150
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:45,060
thought stands for that which is the matter is, so you end up conceiving it, with a secondary

151
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:52,860
thought, not with the first one, so matter is, you can say that, means matter is assumed

152
00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:00,780
because it is, but there's not like no matter, really, no, it's here again, that's the

153
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,700
denial of the matter, so again, that's also a negative one being, there is no of this

154
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:15,220
matter, so like, for example, when we ever talk about, I feel like I'm going to say the

155
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:24,780
EI is the fleshly organ in the world by which there is vision, so when I think of that

156
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:32,780
I, it's never the I, it's always the thoughts, exactly, but now see, when you say that, now

157
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:39,180
you already imply with your peripheral thoughts that something else, another thought is that

158
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:48,420
I, so no thoughts is the I, exactly, the I is I, the thought is thought, so you can have

159
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,900
a thought of the I, you can tell it whichever you want, as long as that thought does not

160
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:01,220
imply the conceiving of the I, the I does not find a footing in that thought as it's, as

161
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:10,700
it's existing there, so that's the whole point, clearing these domains from confusion, from

162
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,980
the assumptions of overlap, the assumptions of mixing, the assumptions of finding footing

163
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,140
in it, you don't need to deny or affirm anything, you just have to think your thoughts, feel

164
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:32,380
your feelings and perceive your perceptions, and these three are separate things, simultaneously

165
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:39,900
present always, but not the same, and certainly cannot be mixed or interfere with each other,

166
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,620
so I can think about the, that's the fleshly organ in the world by which there is vision

167
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,300
you know I want, but it's never the I, exactly, but even when you make a statement that it's

168
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,860
never the I, never will be, make sure that that statement then does not imply through

169
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,740
the peripheral background, some other less defined thought that's assumed to be that

170
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:10,140
real I, and that's just a matter of, so you then know, you end up only being able to,

171
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,820
you end up being able to only know that you're only going to think your thoughts, nothing

172
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:23,300
else, but that's possible because the real matter, the matter, and itself, it's present

173
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:31,260
there, but when you have clarity of these thoughts, then the thought that matter that's present

174
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,700
there, because of which I'm able to think about matter or anything else, you won't be

175
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,300
conceiving it, because you reach the clarity, because you see that they're entirely separate

176
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,300
of the limits.

177
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,180
Yes, you will have enough of the mindfulness span, so to speak, that no peripheral background

178
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:54,740
can introduce more confusion, because the matter is clear to you, literally, pun intended

179
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,740
there, because the point is, when you, as I said, when you make a statement or you're

180
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,540
thinking, oh, well, this is not that which matter is, that's fine, but the mind hasn't

181
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:12,100
been developed to kind of not lose the span, so to speak, which means that without a sufficient

182
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,940
span, you're going to assume that some other thought is then the real matter.

183
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,540
But when you know that the matter is there, and that thought doesn't stand for that because

184
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:26,780
of which that thought that matter is there is there, then you find it, and you don't have

185
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:34,620
to go further, no, you have to stop short, and this kind of thing, that's completely unraveling

186
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,580
of your thinking in a sense of freeing it from any assumptions and conceiving.

187
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:47,580
And that's developed by the repetition, oh yeah, thinking in that way.

188
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:54,260
So it's still, I think, correct me from wrong, good direction to say, you know, my thought

189
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,820
of the eye is not the eye, but then I also have to take it as far as it needs to go as well.

190
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
Oh yeah, absolutely.

191
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,700
I'm not saying that's the wrong thing to do, I'm just saying you have to keep taking it further,

192
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,620
because often people would say that, and then, okay, that's clear, it's clear only when

193
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
it's unraveled.

194
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,140
It's going to be really infinity of that direction one, though.

195
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,140
So basically, when you make a statement, oh, this thought is not there because of which

196
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,100
the thought is there, this thought is not that matter, then just, you then even have to

197
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,620
kind of go in a fully defined thought.

198
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:33,100
You just need to remain mindful of the peripheral attitude of your mind then, to kind of fall

199
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,980
into something else, no matter how non-defined that else might be.

200
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,940
Sounds like a very subtle thing.

201
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,300
It is, it is just like a habit of mine to take this, to take that.

202
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:53,900
So when you take this, then you recognize it, that this cannot be that, what you take

203
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,020
and it to be, what you took it to be.

204
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:02,100
But then you just make sure, okay, now that's it, don't overdo it, don't like find something

205
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,660
else then to not take, let it persist for as long as one's persist as such thought, that

206
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,700
this is not that because of which matter is.

207
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,260
And then you find your mind falling into something else and then you do it, you do it.

208
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,500
The point is, you do it and then leave it while it's being present as something that's

209
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,900
done.

210
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,740
So you just basically remain mindful.

211
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,940
But not like I've just been mindful, you can be mindful, anybody can be mindful, but

212
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,220
you need to set it up properly, have a right thought, right intention and then be mindful

213
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,780
while it lasts off it.

214
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:48,020
It seems then it's almost like in a way, it could be described as being aware of multiple

215
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:55,260
things like in terms of, you know, you're on one hand aware of the need for there to

216
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:01,780
be materiality, for there to be thoughts of senses and thoughts of forms or whatever.

217
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:09,340
At the same time, recognizing that view of yours, of the eye, that, you know, flashy

218
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,180
elemental external, how do you want to call it, thing, even that's still not your eye,

219
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,820
you need to see the infinity of where that direction is going, it seems like multiple things.

220
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,900
So you can say that's still not my eye and then you will find your mind automatically

221
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,700
assuming something else is and that's what you need to discern as a that peripheral

222
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,460
assumption, not make it into another thing and say, no, that's also not my eye because

223
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,500
then your mind will peripherally assume something else is, which means when I say peripheral

224
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,220
it means it's like a negative thought, it's not, it doesn't, it doesn't become a positive

225
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,020
center of your attention and you need to see it as such as a negative thought, not to

226
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,500
make it a positive center of attention because then something else would be a negative

227
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,020
thought in regard to that.

228
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,100
So that's what I mean, like to set it up and then leave it for as long as it lasts,

229
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,980
so kind of keep bringing it and making it positive, making it positive because the

230
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,740
extra negative thought in regard to that, it's always going to remain obscure.

231
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,180
It's like like trying to, trying to set up, set up like a balance or something and then

232
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:18,820
it sort of, it falls and then oh, it stands a bit longer, it stands a bit longer, actually

233
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:26,660
this stands pretty well, I need something that won't stay, this is everything stays

234
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:33,500
there, okay this will be tricky, so say you're trying to balance and it falls, but then

235
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,740
you set it up and then oh, last it for a second, last it for, and then it stays, stays,

236
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,700
stays, stays, and then falls, but then it stays, so you don't interfere while it is staying,

237
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,580
that's the point, if you just keep making positive, like assuming that only the positive

238
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,020
thought is a thought you need to be thinking, then that's the problem, then basically you

239
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:02,740
never allow balance to set, because you would be doing this intentionally bringing that,

240
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,580
you put it back up, and then if you actually want to stay on its own, you pick it up and

241
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,380
put it again, you pick it up and put it, you pick it up, no pick it up, let it fall, then

242
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,900
put it up, let it fall and pick it up and then stays, stays a bit longer, then don't

243
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,700
pick it up, it's for the longs and stays, then when it falls, you do the same, pick it

244
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,580
up again, but not just like picking it up, picking it up, picking it up, because then

245
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,380
you wouldn't even discern what a balance is, so same principle as when you're like just

246
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:41,220
doing things, you're mindful of like let's say your body in a peripheral way, yeah, it's

247
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,660
really like an anchor basically, are you anchored in the background so that you can actually

248
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,980
keep seeing this thing, if it's in the balance, and if it's not, okay, let me set it up,

249
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,820
now it's probably, probably, probably, but it's still considered upward, and that's it,

250
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,780
you don't have to interfere with it, the same you set up the thought, this thought can

251
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,460
only be the thought, not that because of which this thought is there, and your mind

252
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,140
latched, okay, did it again, but then you won't latch so quickly every time, sometimes

253
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,460
it will still, that thought that you just thought, as a thought, not as then because of

254
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,900
which the thought is there, is still there, that's fine, just be mindful of that, that's

255
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:30,260
already practiced a proper meditation as well, wait for the background, look at it, discerning,

256
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:36,020
still there, still the same thing is there, it's fine, it's fine, you don't have to wait

257
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,220
for it to end, no it's okay, just relax now, it's still up, and then you find your mind,

258
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,140
oh, it's not up anymore, so every change that speak is abrupt, as I know you're saying,

259
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:53,140
so you won't find the moment when it's not set up anymore, you just want to find it's gone,

260
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:04,900
so that's why most people have actually no sense of a recognition of the notion of enduring

261
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:12,100
persistent or changing, and that's what the mind development is, because arising is

262
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,980
persisting while changing that is increasing, ceasing is persisting while changing that is decreasing,

263
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,220
which means all you want to have is different directions of enduring things, arising and

264
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:31,540
ceasing in regard to your thoughts and feelings and perceptions, so the point is to train your mind

265
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,820
in regard to that, because the balance is there, then you don't have to interfere, not knowing

266
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:44,420
what the balance is, you'll just keep doing everything in nothing, and you certainly wouldn't

267
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:49,460
know how to set it up, that's why, oh, he can obtain first, you know, John is at will,

268
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,020
yeah, because he fully understood it, he can just think it, and he enters it,

269
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:04,180
it's hard for me to wrap my head around the ideas, both like a positive and negative thought,

270
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:11,460
yeah, it takes training, it takes repetition, training of the mind to start discerning it,

271
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,460
you can't visualize the negative, because you're visualizing positive, which means that

272
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,820
has something else's negative in regard to it, so while you're visualizing, you start

273
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:27,620
discerning the background of that visualization, without that thought, without making it then

274
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:35,620
the central, because then something else would be the peripheral, if we use this example in terms

275
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:44,420
of consciousness, let's say, you know, okay, there are things named in the form, one can't even

276
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,340
really make consciousness positive, impossible, it's the ultimate negative, one makes consciousness

277
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:58,740
positive through basically appropriating it, that's how consciousness gets established as it says

278
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,100
in the surface, but actually in its nature, yeah, consciousness is the ultimate, that's why for an

279
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:11,300
argument, what's that translation, the non-indicative consciousness, basically means consciousness,

280
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,500
it doesn't point to anything anymore, which means that consciousness is inconceivable,

281
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,740
that's why it's, you know, the mind is liberated, it doesn't, doesn't set, doesn't get

282
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:27,860
established upon anything, that has appeared, anything on how we're bigger small is just left for what it is,

283
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:35,220
but there's still like awareness of things, well yeah, but even the awareness belongs to those

284
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,180
things, those phenomena, then there's a reason, not to your end of the stick, which there isn't

285
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:47,620
your end of the stick, there is, well, there is a sense of self, a sense of me, but when that's

286
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:54,500
abandoned, then there isn't, but in terms of like establishing mindfulness in that kind of

287
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:01,940
direction, so like, you know, things appear, I can be aware of that, that positive things

288
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:10,340
sites, whatever, but in the, I guess it's a fact of my mind, somehow not making it a positive

289
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:18,340
thought of consciousness, the mind can be trained to be aware that these things are only there,

290
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,900
because there is a, what do you mean not making it a positive thought of consciousness?

291
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,980
Like if I'm looking at things I'm saying, I make a positive thought saying, oh I can only see

292
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,180
these because there is consciousness, like making it a thought and then assuming the thought is

293
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:41,060
the consciousness. Oh right, yeah, don't do that, but you can still in the, you know, sense,

294
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:46,660
know that there can only be things because there is consciousness. Yeah, so you can discern,

295
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,860
you can know what consciousness is, but then that, that's why the suit as it says there,

296
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:59,460
consciousness is to be fully understood. So it's identifying consciousness within your

297
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:06,020
experience. Consciousness is where understanding is. The consciousness that has been liberated

298
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,100
from many assumptions and conceding in the same sense of the matter that has been liberated

299
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,100
from considering is the nature or the experience of understanding.

300
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:23,380
As in everything that appears understood. The nature of things.

301
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:31,940
Yes, understood, the fire aggregates, yeah. But you're still always trying to explain it

302
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,420
yourself, which is fine, but you make sure you don't settle on the explanation.

303
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:42,420
The point is, when I said you have to develop your mind in regard to the

304
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:52,260
phenomena of things enduring as they have risen, that means basically the center of the experience,

305
00:27:52,260 --> 00:28:00,180
of your experience is not in you or only you or with you or yours, it's basically in that which

306
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:09,620
is enduring at the time, whatever attention, whatever that thing might be, whether it's a thought,

307
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:16,740
feeling or perception, as that upon which your attention is set up and you're mindful of,

308
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:24,180
that is the center of your experience. From there you infer subtly, implicitly sense of self

309
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:29,060
and sense of ownership and everything, but only because thing has a reason first beforehand.

310
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,380
You'll find it there, that's what I mean. So the center of the experience basically

311
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,900
slowly shifts on to the actual arising and ceasing. The five aggregates, the nature is to rise,

312
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:46,100
having the reason, the nature is to cease. But both, arising is manifest, cessation is manifest.

313
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,700
Remember the center shifts to that. The center from your sense of self shifts on to the center

314
00:28:51,700 --> 00:29:02,180
of arising of things. Because now it's me and things that are around me and they're happening to me,

315
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,380
but that center me exists only because you own things that happen to you,

316
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:15,300
which means it's not a center. Because it's dependent, it's actually, it's dependent upon

317
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:22,100
ownership of things that arise on to the core. But myself is not a center. Yeah, it's just layered over things.

318
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,180
It plastered over it.

319
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,980
It's even plastered over.

320
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,180
Like for instance. Well, yourself that feels like I sent myself, my sense of self right here,

321
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:42,100
that is, it's really such. But you want to see that that's a mistake. You want to approve it by

322
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,860
seeing that this very center of self, the real center of self, depends upon ownership of these

323
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:55,220
things is not my center. That cannot be my center. Yet my center depends upon that, which means,

324
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,020
oh, well, that's no really. When I say the center, the center implies the mass,

325
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,980
the puppeteer, the string puller, the one who controls all of it.

326
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,020
When you're saying center, you're saying control.

327
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,300
Yeah, of course. That's what sense of self is. The center of the experience, the main hub.

328
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,860
I was getting confused in terms like the mind being central related to the senses,

329
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,420
but still not.

330
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,660
Oh, right, right, right, right. Well, that could correspond, which is why people assume

331
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:28,660
myself is my mind. Similar, but that's a different thing. I'm talking about the actual, just

332
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,900
sense of center, the sense of self implies right here as opposed to everywhere else.

333
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,300
But it's everywhere else. I, the experience as a whole that has to rise first and endure

334
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,980
such from like, and through like a constant ignorant habits and assumptions, you develop,

335
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,940
you assume the center here to which things happen.

336
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,260
Without understanding that the reason things are more fundamental.

337
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,540
Yes, structurally precede the center, not temporarily.

338
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,340
Yes. So it's while the center is here, president has to see it, while it's there,

339
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,300
as dependent upon that, which cannot be that center.

340
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,100
And then even that ceases to be that master center.

341
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:26,260
So then with the grounds to rising and ceasing, it's one one's seeing that in terms of like,

342
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:35,700
like, make things arise, see, you know, become more present, less present,

343
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,700
endure, I don't know where I'm going, I'm just confused.

344
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:50,020
Well, yeah, it's not, you can't, you can't, you can explain it yourself, you can get the

345
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:57,460
intellectual idea of it, but they won't make you understand it. And like, that's true for everything,

346
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,780
but with this, particularly, that's why nobody understands it. That's why people even,

347
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,500
often they don't even say, arising, ceasing, persisting while changing, they say,

348
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,020
arising, enduring, ceasing. They change your order, because the thing doesn't matter.

349
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,740
It absolutely matters. Because if you say arising, enduring, ceasing, I mean,

350
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,780
no, you're just witnessing things arising, and then persisting for a while, and then disappearing

351
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:32,500
externally, and you leave yourself entirely out. And you also fail to see that whether it's

352
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,820
arising, whether it's ceasing, that in itself is manifested, that in itself is already

353
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,180
arising, like cessation is manifested in your experience. It means it has a reason as such,

354
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:49,220
as cessation. How else are you going to know it? If you, if you actually, understanding of your

355
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,580
experience means understanding of components, which means understanding of the actual

356
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,740
cessation of things, as if in a sense, when you look at, look at the, I don't know.

357
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,020
Right, I understand that, like, you don't watch things get destroyed.

358
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,220
Exactly, because you can't, you can't do that to yourself, man. Which means eventually,

359
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:16,420
then we'll be impossible, and while you're alive. So then what you're basically?

360
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,100
So you, and you don't, you don't have to also look, well, where is the arising?

361
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:26,020
Where is the arising? There's always something there. Like, even now, you already have thoughts,

362
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:34,260
feelings, moods, perceptions, so take a big plenty of things to establish a mindfulness

363
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:40,740
upon, and to discern the their enduring. And you can say, the far aggregates are enduring.

364
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,700
Each of them, independent of each other, are simultaneous enduring. The form is enduring,

365
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,300
the feelings are enduring, the perceptions are enduring, the determination are enduring,

366
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,980
and the consciousness is enduring. Far the main, five heaps, simultaneous, the present,

367
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:05,300
act. But heaps, they don't blend it to one much, they remain independent heaps. That's why it heaps.

368
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:14,420
So then, through grants to those, you know, you can see them persisting. How, how is it that

369
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,700
one can discern them as arising? Are they increasing in their persistence or are they decreasing

370
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:29,780
in their persistence? They are arising or they are ceasing? Increasing in persistent.

371
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:37,140
Yes, the endurance is like failing in. Is it increasing in his presence? Or is decreasing

372
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:42,580
in his presence? Do you say that in a matter of attending to it or is that a different thing?

373
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:49,540
No, no, no, no. That's how you find it. Like, say you pick a feeling. Is that feeling?

374
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:54,980
Is it, okay, it's present, no doubt about it. But is it increasing? Is it going to be more of the

375
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,580
same feeling? Or is it kind of failing out? So it's still the same feeling, still like the identity

376
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:06,580
of the same feeling, but is it increasing or is it decreasing in his presence? It's a strength.

377
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:12,180
Exactly, the intensity of it. And that's where you're referring to the particular things.

378
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:19,300
Well, you don't pick particular things and do that, because I mean myself doing this

379
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,620
thing. No, you find that in your experience already, which means you always have to start

380
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:30,900
with the experience as a whole. That becomes the particular thing. Is there in all this within

381
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:39,300
that field? Yeah, I suppose. On the basis of that field. So first you have to basically learn

382
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,500
how to be mindful of the experience as a whole. Nothing specific. Just experience as a whole.

383
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:52,340
Like me sitting in the room on the chair holding a book. Well, as such, but it's not as specific

384
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,060
as if you were to just be mindful of you holding a book. I'm like intensely focusing on my

385
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:02,180
holding a book. Yeah, don't do that. Or don't like look for things out there to do the practice

386
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,740
I'm just describing. That's when you start with experience as a whole, and then within that

387
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,220
a particular thing might emerge. But even if they don't, that can then be your particular thing.

388
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,660
The non-emergence of anything. Yeah. Just in the room. And that is enduring, exactly.

389
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:25,540
And in the same level, so to speak, you will find feelings as moods, as like mind shapes,

390
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:33,060
so to speak, expanded, depressed, elated, light, heavy, time, full of energy. All of those

391
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:39,380
are basically states of your mind that you discern as such. It's a you who is depressed or you

392
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,420
who is elated. Just for mind is elated. The mind is depressed. The mind is blinded.

393
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,700
Oh, the mind is invisible. Oh, the mind is very visible.

394
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:58,340
You can desert whichever one. If you start discerning the mind like that, it will stand for that,

395
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,900
which the mind is, which you're discerning. And then it's enduring as such. So you can be going

396
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:08,900
throughout your day, but the mind is still in this depressed mood, don't matter. And then you see,

397
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:18,260
again, when you reattend the same depressed mood, then you find it, it's weakening, so to speak.

398
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,220
Okay. So you're not doing anything. It's just the mind. The mood of the mind is fading out.

399
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,580
It's ceasing. And that the current without any of anything on your part?

400
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:34,820
Absolutely. And then, oh, next thing you know, you get distracted. Then you reattend your mind

401
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:41,940
where it was. And then it's actually quite peaceful, my mind now. That has, oh, is this peace now

402
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:48,420
coming over? Oh, yeah, yeah. It's a new thing. It's increasing. You can do that with anything.

403
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,820
Absolutely. But you want to do it with mind, with feelings, because those things are the ones that

404
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:00,820
matter. And if you do it on that level means the mind is sufficiently developed. And then obviously,

405
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,940
yeah, it can do it with anything. You tend to find it at an increasingly increasing.

406
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,660
You know, I don't want to only do all this with very few.

407
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,020
Well, yeah, but in order to try to do it rightly, you can get the right view.

408
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,780
The grasping the sign of the mind is a prerequisite for the right view.

409
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,820
And that's exactly what it means. You can't see your mind in any state if you have absolutely

410
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:35,700
no sign of the phenomenon of the mind, not even a remodeling of the shape of it. But you start

411
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:42,420
discerning that. Okay, there you go. And are we, are we getting into a kind of a different

412
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,540
approach here from senses for this thing? Well, yeah, I wouldn't worry about the approach of senses

413
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,980
of, I mean, you can use anything for your practicing or your reflection. But no matter about

414
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,940
approach, you're coming to, you have, he has to start on the basis of mindfulness of the experience

415
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:06,100
as a whole. And that's the thing coming to anything. Yeah, because that is the starting point.

416
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:12,180
Like say, say things have proliferated mistakenly. So you want to bring it back to the point

417
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,260
that's kind of good enough close to the point when it doesn't matter what proliferation is.

418
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:23,620
And that point is experience as a whole. But if you start even picking right to

419
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,860
the base upon the right instruction or attend to this or attend to this, but you attend it further

420
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:33,780
down the line after things have proliferated. You won't work there. You won't take the root.

421
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,340
And when I say, like attend the means exactly what I said before, you have to start with experience

422
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,580
as a whole not just pick an object within already a non-mindful experience as a whole.

423
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,220
So you discern the object within the experience as a whole. You don't pick the object on top of

424
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:56,340
the experience as a whole. So it's a different direction. Please enter again. You discern the object

425
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:02,820
within the experience as a whole that you're mindful of. Within that, then you discern the object

426
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,420
without losing the mindfulness of the experience as a whole. So that's the opposite direction from

427
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,500
the direction of our pick and object without the basis of the experience as a whole. So you don't

428
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:23,380
pick it, you find it. You step into it, so to speak. So those two simultaneous things, a

429
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:29,860
particular general positive negative, you want to say it? Yeah, but the order does matter.

430
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:36,020
Because you know, I can have a, I can, like, there you go. I can be, I can be attending to this

431
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,260
table and the things on the table. So that's a particular thing. But then within that, I can be

432
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:45,140
attending with the cup at the top of the table. So now the cup is more particular than the other

433
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:49,700
particular thing. But really, they're all particular things because I'm forgetting about myself.

434
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,540
Yourself and your situation. Exactly. So that's why that proliferation

435
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:00,580
matters. You need to find a place, bring it back, where you include yourself, which is

436
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,340
experience as a whole. Why? Because it's the proliferation that takes that sense of self out

437
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:10,420
and then leaves it intact. No matter what reflection you do. Oh, yeah, this cup is impermanent.

438
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,340
This cup is mine. It's very dear to me. And so on and so forth. But it's impermanent. It's

439
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,380
made of this. It's made of that. You left yourself out again. But if you find yourself in

440
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,700
the experience as a whole, sitting in this room, thinking about this cup, that it's very dear

441
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,980
and precious gift that was given to me, which it isn't by the way. Just for example. Then,

442
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,980
okay, so you start with yourself as the basis. And within that, you discern the object of

443
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:42,980
their value. And in that direction, reflection can go. But not just go out. Forget it by

444
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,780
yourself. That's why experience as a whole mindfulness of it needs to come first.

445
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:57,780
So when we say it's situation, it implies you always. It should. Because you are always in

446
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:04,260
this situation. But the situation is not any particular thing. Exactly. I am sitting. Exactly.

447
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:11,780
Situation is just experience as a whole. The thing is a whole. And that can be anything else of

448
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,580
all. Yeah. Whatever you are. Whatever you do. Whatever you think. Whatever you feel.

449
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,740
That's part of the experience as a whole that's already there. The presence of the five

450
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,220
hundred years. That's the situation. And it doesn't matter. I'm saying, oh, this is the feeling

451
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:30,900
there's the perception. No, it doesn't matter. You can discern that within that situation then.

452
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,580
And then you would actually be discerning that which feeling is. As opposed to just assuming

453
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,420
and thinking, then attending upon your assumption of what you think the feeling is.

454
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,220
That's what I mean. You find those things in the experience. Once experience as a whole

455
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,820
has been brought up, brought up to light with mindfulness sufficient amount of time.

456
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:58,100
But without that as a basis, you're not actually fishing in the right pond to speak.

457
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,980
Yeah, I can think of the words experience as a whole and situation, but I've only been

458
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:12,660
maybe a few times or I was like, oh, this might actually be what that means. Otherwise,

459
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,860
it's always a kind of a vague thing what that might be. Yeah. And it is. It would be a vague

460
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:23,620
experience because it's basically like mind waking up. Mind for being constantly absorbed in things.

461
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:30,260
Just waking up. That's where some people, that's where people like, you know, they come across it.

462
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,060
Even people with a wrong view just experiences a whole mindfulness. And the minds are blown away

463
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,340
by it because they never used to it. They spiritualize it. They mystify it. And then you can see that

464
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:46,260
often here that certainly and it's kind of the pinnacle of every teaching and every religion.

465
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:52,340
You just be here now. Be mindful. The pure presence, the pristine awareness.

466
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:58,660
You just mystify mindfulness of experience as a whole. But that in itself means nothing.

467
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,660
As you can see by all the different teachers and people that talk lots of stuff,

468
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,060
that doesn't actually lead anywhere. Anybody can be mindful. That's what I say. Like,

469
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,980
you need to know what you're supposed to look for. So yes, absolutely. Mindfulness comes first.

470
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,980
You can never have too much mindfulness. But that in itself, it certainly not the end. That's just

471
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,980
the beginning. For most people, that's where the practice ends. Just spend your rest of your life

472
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:30,900
just be here now. Mind, whatever judgment-free, your mind is a present, pristine awareness,

473
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,900
all those things. Just do that. Just do that. And then what? That's it. Just do that.

474
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,980
And it'll work kind of eventually. Exactly, by itself, but it won't, of course. And it doesn't.

475
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,980
Then you just end up revolving around more sophisticated around beings, or not even so sophisticated.

476
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,580
The point is mindfulness is not the end. It's the beginning of your practice.

477
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,220
So yes, start with that pristine awareness, which is a contradiction in terms. It doesn't matter.

478
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,500
Calling whatever you want, do it. And then within that, start discerning what you're supposed to know,

479
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,220
which is what it's supposed to tell you. But don't use the subject just to come to that experience

480
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:14,100
and then mystify yourself. Because the feelings need to be understood. The thoughts need to be

481
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:19,300
understood. The perception needs to be understood. I wouldn't understand that if you just sort of

482
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,100
you don't see what's surrounding. Exactly. If you're just kind of frozen in this ecstatic,

483
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:33,300
not even ecstatic, just this neither here nor there, all around luminous presence of my pristine

484
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:42,580
awareness, and then what, great. But if you actually don't forget that you're supposed to understand

485
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,980
these things, then it becomes just up. This is just mindfulness. Mindfulness of experience is out.

486
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:53,060
Sure, feels light, feels luminous, feels whatever, in the comparison to like stage before,

487
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,300
stage of non-mindfulness. You're going to say people are not mindful of it as if you've already

488
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:04,020
lived. That's all true. But that's what mindfulness is. So you kind of wake up to do the work,

489
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,700
not wake up and celebrate the you woke up and you haven't done any work,

490
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:16,260
which is what most spiritual practice is after that. It is great for gratitude and

491
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:23,780
easing, but not, but no work done. Just we reach this song. Look, we can be mindful.

492
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:29,380
So no wonder now people try to take the mindfulness and apply it,

493
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:36,100
like speaking to the psychiatrists the other day in Kenya. And they were saying there's a whole

494
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,940
movement, and I know there was an event in England, this whole movement of applying mindfulness.

495
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:47,300
I like, not in a religious context, not in a Buddhist context, just the mindfulness for this

496
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:53,460
mindfulness. Is this? Yeah, great. They call it mindfulness based stress therapy. Oh yeah,

497
00:46:53,460 --> 00:47:01,700
yeah, even any chest in England, national health, national health system, even they started

498
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:10,020
doing courses in mindfulness therapy, place them. It's fine, I mean sure, mindfulness is always

499
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:16,340
better than non-mindfulness, but don't mistake mere mindfulness for understanding of the dhamma

500
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:23,140
and being free from suffering. That's basically my point. If someone says it's great,

501
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,380
but often it is, obviously people think it's the goal. That's it. That's the goal of the whole

502
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:33,860
practice to be here now, present. You are already now, present. Where do you want to be or not?

503
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,460
You don't have to make any effort to be present because you're not sure about it.

504
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:45,700
So you can just become aware of it, and then you can either go mystical or you can become aware of it,

505
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,180
and soon as okay, now I have to do the work. It's not on my way. And then you do the work,

506
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,820
and the work is understanding. You investigate in the meaning, not leaving anything unturned,

507
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:00,740
as many ways in the world it would put it. And when it's understood then yet, you can't help

508
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:08,980
but not be mindful of this name. I think an important criteria for myself is recognizing

509
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:18,500
if a thought I'm having is a description versus an explanation. That can also be determined

510
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,180
whether you're mindful of it or not. If you're mindful of it properly means you're not losing the

511
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,500
base of the experience as a whole, which means then it's a description. But you can have the same

512
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:35,060
thought, but it's baseless, and then it's an explanation. So when we say explanation, that basically

513
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:40,980
means almost like abstract. It becomes abstract, it becomes abstracted from the base that's

514
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:47,220
non-existent. The base in mindfulness is always exactly. That's what I was saying, I think in one

515
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:52,020
of the talks with Tanya, I was telling that abstract is basically your attitude, not necessarily the

516
00:48:52,020 --> 00:49:00,580
content. So you can think something right as an explanation, but it's not the anonymous. Exactly.

517
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:07,540
Because in you're not recognizing the situation which you're having a abstract thought.

518
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:12,260
Yeah, if you were to reestablish the mindfulness and have the same abstract thought, it will

519
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:16,260
cease to be abstract. Because now it's actually standing for that which it represents.

520
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,420
That's why I say, when Biko Bodhi, he says in his translations,

521
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:26,660
all, when this is the first line, it's just an abstract principle.

522
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:31,860
And then he goes on explaining the rest of the things about it differently. It's an abstract

523
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:39,300
principle only because you don't understand it, hence it's abstracted. So far from dismissing

524
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,300
something because it's abstract, that you just tell you that actually you don't understand it.

525
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,220
So you should understand it where it ceases to be abstract. So when you read all this,

526
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,540
when the Buddha describes the state of mind and whatever else, the people usually all

527
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,140
these are abstract or something, it's abstract because you have no clue what he's talking about.

528
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:00,260
So you have to find out and then he won't be abstract. The element of worth, the casino worth,

529
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,420
the casino based, the casino that, for most people just abstract, there's absolutely no idea

530
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:10,260
what he's referring. But that doesn't mean that the actual content is abstract. This means

531
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,900
the minds are so far abstracted from that they have no concept of it.

532
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:25,220
So when we're doing it properly, like in terms of descriptions, if the one who used that word,

533
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:34,100
that's supposed to affect the nations, it means that we have that background where we have awareness

534
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:42,420
of it and then we've been back. Exactly. And of course I can say that it's easy enough to say.

535
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:47,700
It's easy enough to say, but it's hard to repeat its efficient amount of times, but it's not

536
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:55,060
impossible. And it's not hard in terms of, oh crap, how can I be mindful of the experiences of

537
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,540
everybody, can you guys, a lot of the experiences of all, nothing specific, just on the end now,

538
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,820
you can start with that, if you want. Within that, then without losing that, you have to develop

539
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:12,900
this element. And that's just repetition. And by losing that, we get absorbed, it's

540
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:18,100
absorption, like wrongly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You lose it basically. It's easy to be the basis of your

541
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:25,140
description, of your reflection, of your investigation, of your meditation. It's easy to be that,

542
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:30,900
which means you fall in of the right base. You're not looking at the right place. You might be

543
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:36,180
all looking at the same thing, but from a completely wrong angle. And then angle is angle that's not

544
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:41,140
rooted, not established on the right base, of mindfulness of the experiences of all.

545
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,140
Because you say, I'm mindful of the experience of all, and you can know, you might not know what's

546
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,580
specifically, but you know, whatever they would have talked about in the suit, however abstract or

547
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:55,860
not, is to be found within this mindfulness of the experience as a whole, just depending how far

548
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:02,660
you take your mind within there. It's not left right up or down, internal external, it's within this.

549
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,620
This is why I recorded these things. Yeah, no, this is absolutely. I mean,

550
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:23,300
nobody could remember this. You remember it? Well, I don't remember it. I'm just speaking from

551
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,940
the same place. So we'll just come up the same way every time, but if you'd asked me to repeat

552
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:33,220
now what I said, I couldn't repeat in the same way. No possible.

553
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:56,020
It's funny that the thought said always, not always, but the rise of others, it's kind of a

554
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:02,820
surprise. That's the word he is, trepidation. Kind of like, well, I don't know if I can even do this,

555
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:08,580
it's also, don't. Yeah. But then it's kind of like, you know, it's fairly could be like, well,

556
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:17,620
okay, maybe, maybe not yet, so try. That's the most important attitude to develop

557
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:25,780
or to abandon. For Tunisists, to recognize that this is not out of my reach, because most people

558
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:33,940
would just dismiss it off. Yeah, well, even if it's too much, there doesn't mean you have to,

559
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:38,980
you should not do it. You might get closer to it, so next time won't be too much. Either way,

560
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:43,780
everyone goes to waste, but it's not too much. You were born as you were lucky enough, you had

561
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:50,740
enough good merit to be born as a human. So you've done enough good in the past to have

562
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:56,260
intact faculties. You've done a good, good in the past to have intact intellect, so that's

563
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:00,980
something that excuse them. You're a reason that we're human being with operating faculties and

564
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:08,900
operating mind. That has time, relatively speaking. Absolutely, no, no, no, no, that's a perfect

565
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,020
requirement. If you were there, you would be more unfortunate. If you're not human, you'd be

566
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:19,620
more unfortunate. If you're lower than human. So you realize actually, no. And then again,

567
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:25,220
as I said, everybody can be mindful. So you don't have to worry in Tunisists to memorize that

568
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:32,180
whole canon or understand every little end of their point, and they were talking about, no,

569
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:39,460
so just his ways, he would come out when he would be describing the same experience, experience

570
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,300
of the right view. There are other people might describe, well, they can serve it differently,

571
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:47,780
but he wouldn't mean different things. It means the same. They can just explain differently,

572
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:53,140
or not so detailed. Because many, many, even in the sutras, they would have said,

573
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:57,700
you know, they can be an ara, but he has no gift of speech, no gift of explanation. He can still

574
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:03,220
explain, but not to the vast group of people, to diversify his explanation, because he just

575
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:08,180
doesn't have those capacities. But it doesn't mean that he does not have the meaning of his explanation.

576
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:14,740
If he weren't, he wouldn't be an ara. So everybody can be mindful of the experience as a whole,

577
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,900
and you know, that's where you're supposed to look. That's where you start. And you're not actually

578
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:24,740
trying to accomplish anything in terms of understanding all of this and feeling it all out.

579
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:30,660
All you're trying to accomplish is become impermeable to suffering. And that's done on the

580
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,420
basis of the mindfulness of the experience of the whole. For overshoulders, nothing else.

581
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:39,860
You understand that? You understood all of it. Because everything is within that.

582
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:47,060
As in discerning what is suffering, origin, in? Being free from it. This story we were about

583
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:55,540
four. Just think about one. Completely free. Free, directly and free peripherally. It means

584
00:55:55,540 --> 00:56:03,380
free from possibility to suffer as well. There is even, I have some hard in. I don't know if I am

585
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:10,820
I currently like suffering. Exactly. But then you ask yourself, well, yeah, okay, maybe not now,

586
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:17,780
because maybe now a Neutrophilic is present. But it's a point. Exactly. Am I completely free from

587
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:24,420
any liability towards suffering? And you can know that for sure. And you can know that for sure.

588
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,620
No, I know we are. Exactly. So that's actually the criteria, not whether you suffer right here or

589
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:37,620
right now. But whether you can't suffer. And that's all you have to do. That's really nothing.

590
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:45,460
It's kind of interesting that it went from talking about sense footage to something. That kind of

591
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:56,420
as you would guess, the verb is like, I don't get it. And then the book that it games in another

592
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:03,940
verse. It's kind of similar. One who conceives, I am equal, I am better, I am worse. My own

593
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:10,100
countervedic gauge and disputes was not shaken in the three discriminations does not think I am

594
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:19,940
equal or better. So at that point, it's kind of like it's less, he's getting less and less subtle

595
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:26,100
with his verses. Even still, it's a pretty subtle verse in the day, but it doesn't get that one in it.

596
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:36,660
And all of you, of course, I am in the first place. I have to be if I can be better or worse than whatever.

597
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:42,820
Exactly. Doesn't matter better, I'm equal, I'm better, I'm worse. You are. Means you're taking

598
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:48,580
yourself to be, means you are centered in that center, I was talking about. And for as long as that,

599
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:57,540
that's the case, they will be disputes, they will be of sense, they will be suffering.

600
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:07,460
The first day that that does understand is the abandoning, reckoning did not assume conceit.

601
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:14,260
He cut off craving here for name and form. The day does in human search for him here and beyond

602
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:20,740
the heavens are all the bones. They do not find one who's not or cut the one untroubled free of longing.

603
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:34,100
So that not finding is because they don't even identify the center of the experience of their self

604
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:41,780
and whether it disowned that. So that kind of way, they don't exist anymore.

605
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,260
You can't, no, because they will apply to things to do this.

606
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:51,860
So it's gone beyond. It can't be consumed. It's gone beyond the duality. Sure.

607
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:58,500
But in that is a formal designation then, there can be misunderstood if one of my flow,

608
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:05,780
or he has gone beyond that self position. Exactly. Like what's Argentinian service says,

609
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:12,580
they unbind it. The flame is not extinguished, it's unbound. Like he hasn't ceased there and now

610
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,900
gone. It's kind of gone, show somewhere else basically.

611
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,060
Some undiscoverable. Exactly.

612
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,460
inexpressible state. They should just explain it.

613
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,180
The designation really is a tango, isn't it?

614
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:36,020
Well, that's all there is, Mick. That's all the tango, is there?

615
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,500
Sure, no.

616
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,540
And then the day of the

617
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,620
finalized saying, when should not do any evil in the world, not face speech mind or body,

618
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:51,140
having abandoned certain pleasures mindful, could it come branding?

619
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,780
When should not pursue? Of course, it is painful and harmful.

620
00:59:53,780 --> 01:00:00,580
Yeah, it doesn't just think how it kind of like when it's kind of many different directions from that one thing.

621
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:06,180
And even while I was a bit of like, I guess say something if he, I assume, knew the day that

622
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,020
it wouldn't get it. Well, it wouldn't get it.

623
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,020
Oh, no. I'll put it.

624
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,780
Didn't he have to have like certain people's minds?

625
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,900
Well, yeah, but it doesn't mean like you really know like every time it will take.

626
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,940
Otherwise, he wouldn't, he would teach only to people who became islands. But not everybody came

627
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,540
islands to listen to him. So it's a matter of choice for them as well.

628
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,620
So he knew that they were impossible to understand, which is why he kept trying.

629
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,100
He said, sometimes I teach some people and I give an instruction clearly and everything,

630
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,300
but they would do the opposite.

631
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,460
And like, well, I'm displeased and I can't imagine that.

632
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,300
But that feeling does not really take my mind, so I don't get upset.

633
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,020
I just don't know how I waste my time.

634
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:59,060
It has another suit, you've talked about some of them before, but I just said one particular question.

635
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:03,140
So is that suit that we're used to, but it talks about like one of your treat foods,

636
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:08,660
like they're a dear son in honor of desert and you think, but it wasn't so much the

637
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:19,140
similes so much. I don't know what it was. Yeah, it was. I mean, I'm just basic.

638
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:23,380
Like, the simile makes sense. It's fine. But just the idea of like,

639
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:31,300
neutriments. Like, okay, the food makes sense to you to nurture the body otherwise it'll

640
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:40,340
shrivel away nothing. But then the other, you know, three contacts, it depends on pollution,

641
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,940
I guess that's some car. Some car there. In consciousness.

642
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:50,900
So these are neutriments, obviously, only many units present.

643
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:57,140
You just have to say, you don't think about like when commentaries describe

644
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,460
a contact that's just coming together of three things, like you can watch it on a screen.

645
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:06,340
No, it means that the sense of self is there. So the sense of self depends upon being

646
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:12,100
contacted. If I think they're appropriated, that's why the verb is boosted. Yeah, being touched,

647
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:19,060
you know. But what is it they're nurturing? Sorry? Like, they're neutriments, but to what?

648
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:23,620
To the sense of self? To the sense of self. I am to appropriation to all it. If you not

649
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:28,580
touch is not appropriate. Yeah. So the whole thing depends on the fact that you're just being

650
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:33,300
touched constantly. And whatever results in that, like feeling,

651
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:38,260
intersections, all. Yeah. Yeah. I know that kind of thing. All nourished by that touch.

652
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,140
So it's kind of saying that in order to maintain a sense of self, there has to be

653
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:53,700
appropriated things, they nurture that sense of self. Yes. Absolutely. To put them more simply, it's

654
01:02:53,700 --> 01:03:02,100
because you take things to be mine, your sense of self is maintained. You stop taking everything.

655
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:09,140
And I say take mentally only. Like not, as I said before, not going to destroy all the possessions,

656
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:14,180
because then obviously mental ownership was still remained. As we spoke before,

657
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:18,980
you remain here about your senses. And since you haven't discern what mental ownership as a

658
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:22,580
phenomenon is, even in regard to the objects, you're not going to certainly discern it then in

659
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:26,820
your senses when you when you thought that you free yourself from ownership by destroying the things

660
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:35,780
you want. So you want to discern the mental ownership. And then your sense of self is not maintained.

661
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:43,060
So in that way, those last three are a little different than edible food. Well, there's subtler.

662
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:48,340
So basically as long as there is a determination that's rooted in ignorance, there's going to be

663
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:54,820
the whole, but it's all part of the results in suffering and so on. And ultimately, the

664
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:59,860
ultimate determination and real sense consciousness. So as long as there is presence of things,

665
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:10,500
as long as things that arise, they will be suffering. You can say that. Again, all that means

666
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:17,060
when ignorance is there. One's ignorance is dispelled in regard to nature of manifestation,

667
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:22,020
nature of presence, nature of consciousness. Then there's no problem in there.

668
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:34,900
There's some similarities you mentioned before, like walking through the desert, eating your son,

669
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:42,340
that somebody with the cow like it stands. Oh, yeah, if it leans, if it sits, yeah, you don't

670
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:51,620
know the rest of it and use that in regards to contact, like whatever your contact with has the

671
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:57,860
potential to be devouring. Yeah, no, every one is divine. Because contact, what it means,

672
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:03,300
eminence, touched. You can only be touched when you're ignorant, which means the fact that

673
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,460
contact, even as a pleasant contact, is touching you, it's already divine.

674
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:13,380
So that's why central pleasures are actually painful, actually painful.

675
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:17,860
Denonite, the most refined contact, like nature contact. Yeah, yeah.

676
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:26,100
Well, not necessarily though. No, no, no. Well, theoretically, supposedly, say,

677
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:31,380
it's only without a right view, but yeah, you want to replace joy of jhana. You want to use joy of

678
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:38,820
jhana to replace joy of centrality. That's fine. I mean, relatively speaking. Ultimately, sure,

679
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:45,140
again, if ignorance is there, which can be, even the one who has jhana, yeah, they're still going

680
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:50,900
to be contacted. So from the ultimate point of view, you don't want contact at all. However,

681
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:55,380
refining contact in regards to the wholesome states, as opposed to the regard to the wholesome states,

682
01:05:55,380 --> 01:06:00,180
can make you and certainly enable you to see contact, nature contact clearer and then feel

683
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:04,500
so from it. That's what along with jhana is, we need very little instruction. With two jhana

684
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:10,420
as jhana is, you only need 90% of the mind to get over it. So now it just needs to get together,

685
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:14,740
get a few bits, bits, bits, right, and that's it, then you'll know how to look at the whole thing

686
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:34,180
correctly. And there's two other similes for the other ones. How because should the

687
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:41,460
nature and mental evolution be seen? Suppose there's a charcoal pet deep in the man's height,

688
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:46,900
fill of going colds, man will come along wanting to live, not wanting to die, because our

689
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:52,340
captain is going to rest his suffering. Then two strong men would grab him and go far and drag him

690
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:58,980
towards the charcoal pit. A man's volition would be to get far away, his longing would be to get far

691
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:04,580
away. His wish would be to get far away from the charcoal pit, for what reason, because he knows

692
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:11,220
I will fall into this charcoal pit. I will meet with death and death and his suffering. It's in this way,

693
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:19,060
because that I say the naturement of mental evolution should be seen. I don't exactly understand the

694
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,820
connection there. Mental evolution, I think that's Chetan.

695
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:31,300
Is the naturement some car or Chetan? Well, Chetan is some car.

696
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:38,980
It's like a fundamental nature of determination, but Chetan is already the determination.

697
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:46,580
Yeah. So, yeah, basically, your intentions. Away from centrality is the same similarly,

698
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:52,420
use hunter woods and shrugs. Like putting your mind into a charcoal, like burning it,

699
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:56,740
but get the burning out, and your mind would be everywhere else except for it to be there.

700
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:06,100
Which means your mind has to stop wanting you, because simply by wanting centrality,

701
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:11,300
you are still within the mental centrality. Even if you're never engaging in it for the rest of your life,

702
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:21,540
but you're still feeding it. So one should not feed it. See, there's the most dangerous thing.

703
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:28,180
The intention to avoid it and overcome it. When it's there,

704
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:33,700
develop intention that you are not going there. Like you've been taken there,

705
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:38,180
oh, but no, you want to be everywhere else except there, and that's enough to not feed it.

706
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:43,380
Provided you stopped engaging in it by body and your senses beforehand.

707
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:47,540
Otherwise, it's just the critical. Otherwise, you won't make this happen.

708
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:56,420
That's why people can think of the dangerous centrality, but then they can't engage in it anyway.

709
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:11,300
Oh, yeah. And people, you can be like mugs of 40-50 years of practicing celibus and restrain,

710
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:18,660
and then the soul can go in and find a woman, because the mind has never left. Very scary.

711
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,980
Well, I suppose, yeah, as a possibility.

712
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:25,780
Is it the thing that one could fall into the trap?

713
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:31,780
Well, the trap is scary, sure. But the fact is that it's their own doing.

714
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,820
If you spend 50 years, not three years, they're from the world. You have nobody else to blame,

715
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:43,940
except yourself. It's not like that you were bound simply by a chance, and you had absolutely

716
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,940
nothing to do about it. You couldn't do anything about it. You just didn't know what,

717
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:49,460
because you didn't make the effort to find out.

718
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,820
I think, you know, the dastard helmets did that?

719
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:56,340
Just 10 perceptions of what I've done for it, huh?

720
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:02,900
I always thought about the last one that way, like, you know, you know, they did in my life.

721
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:07,940
Yeah, that won't be embarrassed. I just think, yeah, what if I'm like a, if I make it that far

722
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:11,220
30-year monk, and, you know, who asked, oh, what have you attained?

723
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,500
Then the last simile is a growing consciousness.

724
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,620
How would be kuzh, should the nutrition consciousness be seen?

725
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:26,820
Suppose they were to arrest bandit, criminal, and bring him before the king, saying,

726
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:32,740
sire, this man is a bandit, the criminal, can pose a name that or punishment to wish. It kings

727
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:36,980
us to them, go man in the morning, strike this man in the hundred spears, in the morning,

728
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:43,460
strike him in the hundred spears, then a new one, king asks, how's that man? Still alive,

729
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:48,020
then go, what needs to strike him in the hundred more spears, and so on and so forth.

730
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:52,820
What do you think be kuzh, would that man be struck with 300 spears,

731
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:59,060
experienced pain and displeasure on that count? And they say, even one spear would be bad,

732
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:04,500
never mind clear under the spears. In such a way, that nutrient of kuzh should be seen,

733
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,460
when that nutrient is understood, name and form is understood, when name and force will

734
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,500
be understood, there's nothing further than the most that it needs to do.

735
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:19,380
So that's going back to the idea of, so long as there is consciousness appropriated,

736
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:24,100
there's going to be the opportunity for pain and suffer.

737
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:31,300
Yeah, even the mere presence of things, presence hasn't been understood,

738
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:35,780
means things have been appropriated. And you won't start seeing that,

739
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:42,580
that very root basically of the experience, as being struck by spirit, it will develop full

740
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:47,300
dispassion towards anything else that comes down the line through that appearance of the experience

741
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:55,300
as a whole. But it also more than just simply, I think, seeing that old life is generally...

742
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,380
Oh, no, he's got a very view for any of those things.

743
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,820
Yeah, most of the sutras, oh, Bikku means all sotapanas, at least.

744
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:09,540
Bikku was only disumed, oh, he's already there sotapana. And the ones they haven't,

745
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:14,180
you hear about it in the sutras. The son of the fisherman, the other one.

746
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:18,740
Right, the one with the right view, with the wrong view. Exactly, they know that.

747
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:21,380
Yeah, so all this you need a right view for.

748
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:26,180
Otherwise, yeah, you can go and mow on your whole life and think that life is horrible,

749
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:30,820
but that's not enough for aren't you. When I drive you, and then develop dispassion.

750
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,300
What is a view?

751
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:41,060
A view, basically. Like, I get things again, I can say view, yes, I view the other view.

752
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:44,580
What do you think they've used? Ask yourself, what is a view?

753
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,980
Don't let it tell you, or just ask.

754
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:49,380
Describe it. How do you describe it yourself?

755
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,740
Just any, don't worry about any...

756
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,780
Standard definition, just describe it, whichever way.

757
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:03,060
Like, there is, however, experience might be, it may, I may understand, I may not.

758
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:10,100
Whatever my understanding of it is, whether it's wrong or right, the appeal,

759
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:14,820
but then the confusion comes up. You go beyond things at some point.

760
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,940
How could that be?

761
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,220
No, but what is a view?

762
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:20,820
The nature of a view doesn't matter good or bad, right or wrong.

763
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:26,180
View, what is, what is, what is, why would you describe a view?

764
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,220
How would I?

765
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,060
Yeah, how is it in the nature of a view?

766
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:45,380
How would you define it? Would you call it a direction?

767
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:53,540
View of something, point of view coming from something,

768
01:13:53,540 --> 01:14:00,900
centered in something, something is being viewed, how do you describe it?

769
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,260
I don't mean in terms like I'm viewing the cup.

770
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:09,780
Even that, viewing the cup, just view in general, I'm not talking about you understanding

771
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:14,900
whatever I view right here right now, just read the word view, what does it mean?

772
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:22,340
Any view, looking at your eyes, you view through the window, what does it mean?

773
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:30,020
Seeing something, seeing something, and there is already a direction implied

774
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:35,460
from here you're seeing something there, yeah, and saying goes for the mental view.

775
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:41,380
He says, the right view is the view that's not rooted in our wholesome, not rooted in assumption.

776
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:49,140
So then it's still a direction, and then the mind towards phenomena.

777
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:55,460
Exactly. Well, you can say consciousness, but obviously the consciousness would stand for something,

778
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,940
say of the mind towards a phenomenon, because consciousness is out there with phenomena more than

779
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:06,180
its with your mind. So the point is, you have the wrong view of just the view that's not even

780
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:11,540
a way of itself as a view, and then you get the right view, the view that looks at things as they are,

781
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:18,180
it still looks at them as they are, but in Ireland, done that so much, he doesn't even look at them as

782
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:24,580
they are, because that's what they are. So you could be on the view, the view is not required.

783
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:29,380
He's looking at things rightly, it's not required, because what he has is things rightly.

784
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:36,660
There's no, so that's why the view is like a tool. Yeah, so think about like when I say,

785
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:40,500
oh, you said to be mindfulness of your experience at home, and then you apply your reflection

786
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,540
correctly based on instruction. All of that implies already the direction of the view,

787
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:50,100
then you can be refining your efforts to the point where you just have the right view.

788
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:55,940
So zero effort required, looking to this look, because how you look is the right way to look,

789
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:01,700
and you don't need any work. No effort, no circular explanations, no set-up, no descriptions,

790
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:05,220
you just look at it, and you look at it rightly, because that's how you train your mind,

791
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:10,740
you get it rightly. Ireland can stop doing that as well, because he can't even conceive

792
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:16,420
from anyone, whether he looks or not, thus he is going to be on the view. Could we call it then

793
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:22,020
like more in the verb, like right viewing or wrong viewing? Sure, sure, yeah. The reason

794
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:26,740
what they call it right view, as a noun, is just because you kind of talk about the nature of

795
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:35,780
viewing, but there is actually no view without viewing. Right, yeah. So literally viewing, seeming.

796
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:42,180
And that's definitely, that's very, very like zero effort required.

797
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:48,100
So you have to have a view, may or may not be corresponding to what is.

798
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:52,100
Well, that means that you don't have view. But even the wrong view is kind of effortless.

799
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:56,340
Yeah, just, you don't have to make any further effort. Now to make loads of effort to

800
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:01,060
undo the wrong view, but when you do so, what you have is the right view, and that's what it

801
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:06,740
is, because then he doesn't have to make any further effort, except just keeping that view inside,

802
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:13,460
it's not forgetting about it. Is it possible for the two of you to recognize their wrong views?

803
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:18,420
Well, yes, when they do, they become sort of honest. So not until that point?

804
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:26,020
Well, maybe two degrees, because it's not like putujan, so the body is just like a putujan,

805
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:30,420
a sutva who is completely uninstructed, then the mind who is instructed, then already if he keeps

806
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:35,140
pursuing that instruction, he becomes like a dhamma-sari, your sardhana-sari. So it's not the

807
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:39,060
other body, but it's kind of already attained to the right view, he already developed a criteria,

808
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:45,300
and if he carries on, he will reach so it becomes so the body. So you can't even forget about

809
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,620
sort of an ascetic and whatever, those are just the milestones that they would have singled out

810
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:53,780
in response to like being constantly questioned when people are reborn after their practice,

811
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,740
and he said, well, here are the guidelines you can infer yourself, but before then, he just wasn't,

812
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,820
he just wanted to see the wrong ones, he doesn't see. And the one who sees, is he finished not

813
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,980
quite yet? Well, is he different from sexuality? No, not quite yet, but he has the right view,

814
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:12,500
he has the right view, and then he goes sort of on, and sometimes he doesn't even talk about

815
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,580
suckling on his own, there's just three milestones, depending on who he's even struggling to,

816
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:23,220
doesn't it? The point is, you have to keep trying to understand where the wrong view is,

817
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:27,540
that's how you get the right view, or you have to keep trying to understand what the right view is,

818
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:33,540
that's how you get the right view. So you can get closer to understanding, which you're trying to

819
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:38,020
understand. Still not quite understands, you're still kind of tujina, but you're definitely close

820
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:44,180
to understanding that a tujina will never make the effort to understand it all. That's like a

821
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:50,020
gradual showing of the sea, as you see, when it says, the practice is very great, but you're not

822
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:59,620
suddenly dropped. And so you can discern these wrong assumptions with an external reference point

823
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:03,940
through mindfulness. Yes, if you do it through an internal point of view, then you'll be some

824
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:12,020
assembled. Right. For a particular one. But you don't need to do that, because you have all the

825
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:21,380
instructions you need. I was thinking about that a lot of the teachings in places will come out as

826
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:32,100
a lot of stories, especially about commentary stories. I remember this one that came in my mind,

827
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:41,380
it's called the one on Chula Pantaka. Maybe? The way it goes is like there's two brothers.

828
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:46,420
Oh, yes, yes, yes, it got to go to the potter. I know there's something else, man.

829
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:51,860
Go ahead. I mean, that one's in the Magi Manikai. This is a commentary story. Oh, I don't know, man.

830
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:59,620
Basically, it was said that there are two brothers, I think Mahapantaka and Chula Pantaka's

831
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:05,860
one thing. I think that's the name. Chula Pantaka wasn't very mentally strong,

832
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:14,900
and so they both were deemed, but Chula Pantaka couldn't memorize any suit as I understand them,

833
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:21,940
and so his brother said, oh, you might as well just disrupt your suit. So then he was kind of

834
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:28,100
destroyed, but the certain that was his mind, and he came to him in a flash of light, and said,

835
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:36,100
oh, just take this cloth. Keep doing that. Oh, my goodness. Keep rubbing the cloth.

836
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:41,460
Yeah, and then it said, oh, he saw eventually how I got 30. Oh, my goodness.

837
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:46,660
And so that sounds very commentary on it. Yeah, it will start to make roses.

838
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:55,220
Oh, there's a story of that king who saw the mango tree being ripped apart because people

839
01:20:55,220 --> 01:21:01,220
want to get the mangoes, and he's a king. He got the light, because he realized it's not worth

840
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:05,540
the beauty and the sensuality, because you get destroyed. So he's mind abandoned.

841
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:15,940
Like, it's not. It's not necessarily wrong, maybe he did, but it's wrong to say that,

842
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:20,180
because then people would think that's what enlightenment is. Not the hard work you put in a

843
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:27,060
repetition, but it's like a magical little divine blessings of a stupid idiot rubbing the cloth,

844
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:31,940
and becoming enlightened as a result of it. That's it. That's all you need to do. No.

845
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:37,700
And he certainly would have not got the point. He might have been rubbing the cloth for whatever

846
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:42,980
reason. He had to develop psychic powers. Wow. The rest of the story goes there. He

847
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:46,820
made a thousand copies of himself and no one could figure out which ones are real ones.

848
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:51,620
Yeah, as if that's how some are relevant. Commentaries like to mention these things.

849
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:57,940
But say somebody really recognized the wearing down of things, and then apply the same

850
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:04,580
extrapolate the nature. That's a very refined mind. That's far from stupid.

851
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,460
But the thing you see, the commentary doesn't put the emphasis on that. Say there was a case of

852
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:13,380
somebody who grabbed the cloth and got that incredibly fine mind to apply that to himself,

853
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:18,020
and there was enough deduplication to make him an island. They don't dwell on that,

854
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,940
because they themselves were protusionless commentaries. If they had the right view,

855
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:27,620
they would know where the practice lies in it. No, but they generally thought if you rub the cloth,

856
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:33,060
you can become an island. And so if you stare at clay pots, you can go earth casina.

857
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:37,380
And so if you do this, you observe the source of your feet. You will become proficient in whatever

858
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:41,300
you are doing. I don't know what else I can see up all the months. It's just cloth rubbers.

859
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,660
The whole meditation technique just rubbed the cloth.

860
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,500
No, that's the point. So I said there was a case of something like that. The fact that

861
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:56,020
commentary put emphasis on the fact that there was a tree being destroyed and that's what

862
01:22:56,020 --> 01:23:01,860
King saw and he became enlightened as a result of seeing. No, if he became enlightened,

863
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,980
like for example, Bakia became enlightened when he would have told him and seen,

864
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,340
there was only seeing. Because his mind was previously developed.

865
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,460
So then this little instruction, which is not for the same footing as rubbing the cloth,

866
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:19,540
it's the actual instruction. It was enough. But commentary goes so far and people like to believe

867
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:24,900
that, especially today, whereby no instructions even necessary. You just have to find that

868
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:31,220
magical little thing to do. And enlightenment will happen just as a thing is now. And that's it.

869
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:37,460
You are enlightened forever afterwards. Because you guys all had this experience. People would say that.

870
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:41,060
Yeah, you had this experience. That's what five hundred years are. I am loads of experience.

871
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:46,020
We all have experiences. My grandma had experiences. Everybody has experience.

872
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,100
There's nothing special about any experience at all.

873
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:53,460
Well, there is only one special experience that's when you abandon all the experience.

874
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:58,820
And that's not the experience that you can just have. As the experience you can develop.

875
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:03,540
That's what it's not given to you. You develop it.

876
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:32,500
It means you can't be taken away from it. You didn't come by chance.
