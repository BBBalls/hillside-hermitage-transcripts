00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Now you have specific questions?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Well there's a few things I'm excited about.

00:12.000 --> 00:25.000
There's one about assuming the senses, assuming the senses.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
If one assumes the senses then on account of their feelings grow

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
and the mind becomes damaged with covetousness and cruelty.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
And acts and...

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah this is just a heaping up of suffering.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
No one is said to be far from the banner.

00:51.000 --> 01:07.000
So when seeing a sight, mindfulness becomes confused if attention is focused on the pleasant aspect.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Doing this one remains assuming.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Well basically mindfulness gets confused if one attends the pleasant aspect

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
which is the feelings that have a rose based on the assumed senses.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
So through simply attending that pleasure that's the result of that assumption

01:27.000 --> 01:54.000
you're actually maintaining that assumption through that pleasure.

01:54.000 --> 02:07.000
So yes there is...

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
You can say the assumption comes first but not temporarily first but structurally first.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
So it's simultaneous presence of the assumption and the feelings of the result.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
It's not an account of that assumption but it's simultaneous.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
It's not like you're assuming without feeling and then the feeling comes.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
And because it's simultaneous simply through attending feelings you're maintaining

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
that which sort of determines those feelings which is that assumption.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
And at the same time your mind...

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Well they suffer.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Or the result of that whole picture suffering is present.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
Even that is again the same principle of that simultaneous presence.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
So then you can say assumption results in feelings or assumption results in suffering

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
or assumption results in craving or craving results.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
It's just simultaneously presence is just maintaining each other

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
because you're attending a new bit in that sense.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
So the principle gets maintained.

03:15.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah well mind seems being confused equals the whole system.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Within what is assuming the sense it means?

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Well assuming the senses means...

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
Well literally assuming those senses to be yours or to be...

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Well assuming a sense to be yours and then assuming that which you gather

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
through those senses to be for you.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
So you assume that the sights you see are the sights that your eyes see.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
The sights that you look for you they're yours.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Even if you're looking at things that are not necessarily yours,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
the further you're looking with your eyes it's like your sight.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
So then sight is for me any sight of anything.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
So you have to start seeing the dead phenomenon of senses,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
of my senses.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It's kind of always a negative.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
You can't actually see your eye with the same eye in the same sense.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
So you can... you end up assuming...

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Well you end up assuming because the senses are ambiguous.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
You don't really know it's like a big kind of dark vague cloud of all senses.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
But then all you have is sight sounds, mouth taste,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I just for you.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
So then you just take it for granted.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
But if you discern long enough through that repetition that...

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Whatever notion of your senses you might have,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
that those senses are...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh I think my senses are visitor.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
If you discern that whatever notion you might have,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
those senses will never ever be anything more

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
and certainly will never be anything separable from a

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
flashy organ of eye, skin, tongue.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
But literally these organs, random objects in the world,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
that are put together in the unit of this body.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
So you don't examine the organ like a doctor would impersonally,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
because then it doesn't work.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Then you don't see that connection.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
You don't see that dependence.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
So you have to see your own organs.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
And the only way you can see it is in that external sense of...

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Oh, a lump of flesh, which is my eye,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
tongue, ears, ear drums, it's just organs.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Literally just...

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Just as you have this, this bin,

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
broom, stone, tree, eye,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
liquid, matter, brain,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
brain, brain, basically four elements.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
But these particular material organs are that

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
because of which there are sites that you can discern in the world.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
But it's not in you nor is it for you.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Those organs are external, as external,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
as the external objects are on you.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
You just...

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You don't see the connection.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
And that connection literally needs to be fabricated.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Like you will never see the connection naturally.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It's a secondary.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Because natural...

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Natural way is the way of ignorance.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Natural way is the way that goes with the grain.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
So you have to go against the grain.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
And basically,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
but if you were to dwell on it long enough,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
like a fabricating contemplation that your senses

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
are inseparable, like when I say my senses,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
whatever vague thought you might have about it,

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
take it as vague.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
You have to define it.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Take it as a whole phenomenon, as an entity,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
that vague thought of my senses,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
and then see the presence of that

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
is directly determined inseparable

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
from the flesh eye, the tongue, the skin,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
the nose, ears, brain, whatever.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
You literally, like, no matter what vague thought

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
I might have about my senses,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
the fact that I can even think that,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
ambiguously, absolutely is because

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
this living matter of my body

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
of this sixth sense base is present

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
in that material form.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Because when again gets destroyed,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I can't be handed.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
It's inconceivable.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
So no matter how much you...

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
your mind, your thoughts,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
your idea of senses might feel

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
different from the material objects,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
fundamentally, it can never

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
like escape it.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
So destruction of matter will bring an end to this.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
So that's why I'm realizing that,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
no matter how much you

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
volitionally, reflexively developed,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
you know, your thoughts,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
and your disturbance, and your abstractions,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and your reflect, whatever, whatever you want,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
it's all there possible

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
because there is a living sixth sense

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
body present in the world,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
as a matter.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
When that matter gets destroyed,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
and the material is disintegrated,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
you can't be conceiving and abstracting

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
in regard to it.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You can't know any mental phenomena.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
So no matter what intentionality,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
you can have with your mind,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
it's subordinate to the presence of

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
that gratuitous matter

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
that is living, which is your body,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
life. When that's taken away,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
nothing can be left.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Nothing can remain.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You're just inconceivable.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
But it's like contemplating,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
like drilling, literally drilling,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
that connection, because it's not,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
you're not going to, it's not obvious.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
It seems fabricated, it seems abstract.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And it is, for Kutuzina,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
it is completely abstract.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But it's a right abstraction.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It's the abstraction that,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
if repeated sufficient number of times,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
it will,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
like take root,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
it will correspond to how things actually are.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And then you can see how things actually are.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Which is that, yes,

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
your senses cannot even be conceived to be yours.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
It's impossible.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Let alone that which you acquire

09:29.000 --> 09:41.000
for your senses to be for you.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Come here.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
So you see what I mean?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Like if you think now,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
or if it's very good, I think it's like,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
like my eyes, what is my,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
my eyes, my senses.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
You immediately assume as,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
inside of you, as in turn,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
as part of you.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
But actually, that's a thought.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
And you can have just

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
the another thought, which is,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
well, another way of seeing,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
which is seen as objects as external,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
as a thought.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, that's the thing. You're always going to have a thought.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Not perhaps.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
So when I said, oh, that's a thought.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
It doesn't mean that I'm dismissing it.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I just meant that that big is.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
That you think is the senses.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
You have to see, no, that's a thought.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
That obviously for me stands for that which I think senses are.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
So when you start recognizing that all you're going to have is a phenomenon of thought

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
in regard to your senses,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
then you realize, well,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
then thinking these external organs,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
it's nothing less real than this thought.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Because that's also a thought.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
But it's the right thought.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, exactly.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And then somebody tells you, somebody else,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
like the Buddha and the Sutras,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
tells you that that's the right thought.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And if you keep repeating it,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
it will correspond to how things are,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
because it's right.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
And then you can see how things are.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
But not without the sufficient amount of repetition.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Because that's what I think we spoke about it before.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Well, that's why you can't stumble upon

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
RNA chip or any other sort of,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
but sort of by accident.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And oh, yeah, I got it.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Just testing, you know, wow.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Instant training is like doing this,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
and then this happened.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
It doesn't happen.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
You develop it.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Literally through training and drilling.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So like in this instance,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
the Buddha tells you, this is the right thought.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Obviously, experience of protrusion is top to bottom, is completely rock.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Effective ignorance.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
So you don't have a criteria of what is right thought,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
what it isn't.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So then you have the faith in the Buddha,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
and the Buddha tells this is the right thought.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
And you can think that by thought.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
But thinking it once,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
won't make a difference,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
because you have this whole ocean of ignorance

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
that needs to be drained away.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But then thinking it twice won't make a difference.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Thinking it three times won't make a difference.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
A thousand times,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
then it will be draining away.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And eventually, when it's officially drained,

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
you will recognize all ignorance is drained.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So the point is,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
that drilling,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
that in the beginning, yeah, you have to do an account of faith,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
in a sense that, okay,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
you believe the Buddha knew what he was talking about,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
you have faith, so that's why you're applying that.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
But that's why you can't do that.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
You can sometimes accidentally

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
stumble, like,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
do the right thing, engage in the right thought.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
But if you don't know,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
that that is the right thought,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
if nobody told you, you will not know,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
that that was the right thought,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
and you will certainly not repeat it,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
a thousand times,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
without any apparent result.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So that's why it's impossible,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
like by chance, you know, you can roll a dice

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and you can get it once and twice and five times.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
But you can't get it, it's just impossible,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
inconceivable to, like, always get the right result.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Unless you know that that is the right result,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
and you always go for that.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
So that's why that utterance of another

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
is one of the, like,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
fundamental factors for the right view.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
So you cannot possibly, as I said,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
you might have been doing things rightly,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
attending things rightly,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
but if nobody externally told you

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
that that is the right thing,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
it's simply inconceivable

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
that you would have stuck

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
to repeating those things rightly,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
thousands of times for years,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
because there is no apparent result,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
right away.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
It's not like you do it,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
and you immediately see it.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
You just have to keep doing it,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
and doing it, and doing it,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
and doing it,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
and you accept it intellectually

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
as the right thing,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
like reason, as the Buddha said,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
oh, the man who wants to be free from suffering

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
goes and, like,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
frequents the wise man, he listens to what they say.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
He ponders, makes sense,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
measures the task,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
and he does it.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
So you accept it through reasoning,

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
through discernment,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
on that level,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
but then you keep repeating it,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
and repeating,

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
and repeating,

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
and because you had faith,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
in what the Buddha said,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
to be right,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
you stick to it,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
and you repeat it,

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
ten thousands of times,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
and because it was right,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
you become an out of hand.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
But if you didn't know,

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
if you didn't have faith,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
then it was right.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
You wouldn't have possibly stuck to it.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
For that long,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
because there is no,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
there is no confirmation of it.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
But always,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
until much, much later.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Yes, no confirmation.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
You might have different results.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yes.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
You might have pleasant results.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
You might have a lessening of suffering,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
or more of an understanding.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
What, what, what,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
what gives you,

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
the motivation to continue,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
if you haven't had the end,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
you don't have the end result,

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
but you,

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
it makes sense,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
what the Buddha says,

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
it makes sense,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
so you follow the teaching.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Then,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
but you're not getting great results.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Well, that's,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
that's for somebody who has heard the teaching.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Yes.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I mean, that can be an inspiration for them to continue,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
even without the apparent results.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Yes.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Because it makes sense.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
But imagine how impossible

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
is for somebody to continue,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
who hasn't even heard,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
or accepted,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
through reasoning,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
and develop faith,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
that what the Buddha said was right.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's impossible for them to continue,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
because there is no,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
there is absolutely nothing changes,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
through these drillings,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
through you don't see nothing,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
nothing better,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
no worse,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
you just,

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
you won't even notice it.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
And let alone stick to it,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
and repeat it thousands of times,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
the right intention,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
the avoidant,

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
the wrong intention,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
and so on and so forth,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
then need to things rightly.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Now, you need to be told,

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
when you're told,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
you can discern it,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
when you discern it,

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
then you can do it.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Because as you,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
as it's,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
something makes sense to you,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
so you do it.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And then, say, for example,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
with strength,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
just, you know,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
and keep a strength,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
and then,

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
you reflex,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
as you,

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
as you do,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
and he looks,

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
and you see that,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
there is,

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
so,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
the pleasure of being blindness.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
So,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
there's much,

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
he's an arahant,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
he's not a so-to-funner.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
But,

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
then,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
there are ways of developing wisdom,

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
without Buddha's aid,

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
but obviously,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
it will never lead to the,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
the final abandoning

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
of the assumption of self,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
and self-view,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
and arahant.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
But I mean that,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
once you've actually heard,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
the Buddha's teaching.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Oh, yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
And you do follow,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
you do the strain yourself,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
but,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
you don't,

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
you don't go that far,

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
you don't know if you understand it,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
but you keep the precepts,

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
you get the joy,

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
they come from that,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
then you can,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
maybe be a little bit more confident,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
you think,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
oh, yeah.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
There might be something more to this,

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
what he says,

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
after being restrained,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
and the rest of it,

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
might also be true,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
so I'll continue on.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Well, there's,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
on top of that,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
also,

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
as I said,

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
like,

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
you might be doing things rightly,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
or not,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
you don't know,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
and because,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
you haven't been told externally,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
through, like,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
through the sutras,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
and through the Buddha's instruction,

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
why you should be doing,

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
you don't really have,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
even the external criteria

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
of what kind of corresponds

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
to what,

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
what might be right.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
So,

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
but then,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
if you were to develop that criteria,

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
then you can look back

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
at the stuff

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
you used to do,

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
and you can,

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
actually,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
yeah, back then,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
this,

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
such and such things,

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
such and such way of attending,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
that I was doing,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
that was actually right,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
it corresponds

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
to the print number principle,

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
so to speak,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
it corresponds to how things,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
obviously,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
back then,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
you didn't know,

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
what those principles were,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
so you couldn't have stuck to it,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
and repeated it long enough,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
you can't,

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
you can do it by chance,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
once, twice,

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
ten times,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
but not ten thousands of times,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
by chance,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
impossible.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
You need to have an anchor,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
to bring you back,

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
which would be the discernment.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
And then,

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
you can also look back and see,

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
oh,

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
when I thought I was right,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
and practicing,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
it was completely wrong.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Because now,

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
you've got the criteria

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
that you can also see,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
things in the past,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
you used to do,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
your attempts at practice,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
and so on,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
and you can see,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
oh, actually, no,

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
that was not that wrong.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
But obviously, back then,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
you didn't know,

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
if somebody told you back then,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
you would have stuck to it,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
but nobody told you,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
so it took you longer,

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
or not,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
it depends.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
But that's why it's,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
it's not optional,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
after and after another.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
But then, obviously,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
that's why it also,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
it needs,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
needs to have that initial step,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
first step of faith,

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
that you have faith,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
there is other,

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
the Buddha,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
the Sutras,

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
the Arun,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
the Sothmana,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
might be,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
the Buddha,

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
the Sutra,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
the Arun,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
the Sothmana,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
might know what they're talking about,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
but again,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
it's not that that faith needs to stay,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
till the end,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
that faith is the initial push,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
and then, you know,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
if you do it rightly,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
you'll come to recognize,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
and then you won't need faith,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
or rather,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
you'll replace the faith

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
with confidence,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
because now you know,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
and that's the surface.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Confirm confidence,

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
in the Buddha,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
the Dhamma,

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
the Sangha,

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
it replaces that faith

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
in the Buddha,

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
now you know,

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I don't need to believe in it,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
because I know it.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
It's like,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
it's similar to,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
something makes sense.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
You don't know,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
it makes the most sense,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
and then,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
you understand.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
But always,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
always in the back of your mind,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
have a little bit of reserve,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
because,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
as a Patugina,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
you don't have a criteria

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
of what really makes,

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
or rather,

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
what makes sense

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
to you as a Patugina,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
does not necessarily mean

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
is the right thing.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
So,

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
because often,

19:55.000 --> 19:55.000
yeah,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
it feels right,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
when people are like,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
oh, I know,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I'm not a certain one,

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
but it feels right,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
it's like, well,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
that's a big mistake,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
right there.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
You know,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
you don't know,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
yet,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
you're happy to follow

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
what you think you know,

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
while you,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
at the same time say,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I don't know.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
So, you're just like,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
undermining yourself

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
within the same sentence.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
Oh, it's okay.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
There's somebody there

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
that is,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
there's a connection

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
with the,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
and the Buddha says,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
the Dhamma

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
is leading onwards.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Mm-hmm.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Obviously,

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
anyone can read that,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
and is that,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
maybe not a,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
something that you,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
like a criteria,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
is what they look for, isn't it?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
But then, again,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
you need to discern,

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
because, like,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I'm sure that people who think,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
uh, Dhamma leading,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
like,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
open eye,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
means leading onwards,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
or leading onwards,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
or, uh,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
I'm sure that they're,

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
they're convinced

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
that that is what it means.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
So, you need to be

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
completely self-transparent

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
and see.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Okay.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
So, do I really hold on to

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
this belief,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
just because it's pleasing to me?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Mm-hmm.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Just because it suits my other beliefs?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Or it's because you really,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
really make sense after,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
like, deep,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
profound, repetitive,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
tedious,

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
drilling,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
investigation,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
and contemplation?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
When you know,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
that you have not,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
kind of,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
just covered it up,

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
oh, no, no,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I believe in this,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
it's fine,

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
but you really drilled into it,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
and there was nothing left unturned,

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
then, okay,

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
it's least likely

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
to be wrong,

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
because you really drilled through it,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
through the whole thing.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
And then,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
the answer should

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
you always have to have.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
But most often,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
people just maintain beliefs,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
because,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
it helps them maintain their

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
previous beliefs,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
helps them maintain their previous beliefs,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
and then,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
so it's just, like,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
maintenance of their beliefs.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
And,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
they all do that,

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
for one reason,

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
it's pleasing to me.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Has this said the same?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Well,

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
what is leading on this?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Well,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
leading onwards is exactly that.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Like,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
if you were to understand,

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
for example,

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
what down there is,

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
that understanding

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
will be taking you further,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
and further,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
and further till the orange,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
so it's leading you onwards

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
through that understanding.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
So it's not a theory,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
it's not as

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
abstraction,

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
it's not something you can accept

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
or reject.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
It's something whereby,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
through understanding,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
you are going further.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
So then,

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
you realize there is more.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
There is more.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Through that understanding,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
through that criteria,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
there is more,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
there is more.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Until,

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
as I answer,

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
or,

22:30.000 --> 22:30.000
or,

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
or,

22:31.000 --> 22:31.000

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000

or,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
or,

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
or,

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
or,

22:48.000 --> 22:48.500
or,

22:48.500 --> 22:49.000
or,

22:49.000 --> 22:49.000
or,

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
or,

22:50.000 --> 22:50.000

or

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
or,

22:55.000 --> 22:55.000
and,

22:55.000 --> 22:54.000
or,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
or,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
or,

22:56.000 --> 22:56.000
or,

22:56.000 --> 22:56.000
or,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
or,

22:57.000 --> 22:57.000
or,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
or,

22:58.000 --> 22:58.000
or.

22:58.000 --> 22:58.000
Or,

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
or,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
or,

23:00.000 --> 23:00.000
or,

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
or,

23:01.000 --> 23:01.000
or,

23:01.000 --> 23:01.000
or,

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
or,

23:02.000 --> 23:02.000
or...

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
or,

23:06.000 --> 23:04.000
or,

23:04.000 --> 23:04.000
or,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
or,

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
or,

23:06.000 --> 23:06.000
or,

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
or,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.400
And I think I told you that the other day,

23:09.400 --> 23:14.160
he never, like, no matter what approach he would take on

23:14.160 --> 23:17.200
in expanding the amount to a person or to a group of people,

23:17.200 --> 23:19.520
he would follow that approach through

23:19.520 --> 23:22.120
to define a point of orange, if you're from suffering,

23:22.120 --> 23:24.760
whatever, even if those people don't necessarily achieve it,

23:24.760 --> 23:26.640
his instruction would go all the way.

23:26.640 --> 23:30.360
He wouldn't stop halfway through his approach

23:30.360 --> 23:33.240
that through understanding of number up by and the all,

23:33.240 --> 23:35.080
you can become an arrogant and so on.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.080
He wouldn't stop halfway through and then say,

23:37.080 --> 23:39.280
well, as a matter of fact, number up,

23:39.280 --> 23:41.760
also corresponds to the five aggregates,

23:41.760 --> 23:44.240
and then start comparing it linearly,

23:44.240 --> 23:46.880
always right, you can, it does correspond.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.400
This is experienced as a whole,

23:48.400 --> 23:49.960
whether you take it as five aggregates,

23:49.960 --> 23:50.680
or number up,

23:50.680 --> 23:51.960
vinyana, vinyana,

23:51.960 --> 23:53.360
number up,

23:53.360 --> 23:56.960
but this and that, literally,

23:56.960 --> 23:59.120
but if you start comparing it,

23:59.120 --> 24:03.280
it thesis to be that open icon, like leading on,

24:03.280 --> 24:06.000
which means it thesis to be dama,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.200
because dama is dama only when it leads you out of suffering,

24:08.200 --> 24:10.000
when it leads you towards enlightenment.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.840
So we can be talking the dama,

24:11.840 --> 24:13.720
like dama terms and stuff,

24:13.720 --> 24:16.040
the fact that it's not leading on,

24:16.040 --> 24:17.040
it's not the dama.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.520
And that's why,

24:19.520 --> 24:24.520
like, you can't even by accident teach dama

24:24.800 --> 24:25.600
to somebody else,

24:25.600 --> 24:28.000
without you yourself understanding it,

24:29.560 --> 24:32.560
because that open icon element,

24:32.560 --> 24:34.040
it's something you can't,

24:34.040 --> 24:36.800
it's something you can understand and know,

24:36.800 --> 24:39.320
and then convey to another person in the writer,

24:39.320 --> 24:40.680
knowing what, like,

24:40.680 --> 24:43.720
basically knowing what to say for them to understand,

24:43.720 --> 24:48.560
not sort of comparing dama and comparing the principles

24:48.560 --> 24:50.120
and the terminology for the sake,

24:50.120 --> 24:53.040
like for the scholarly sake by itself, in itself,

24:54.040 --> 24:55.920
and then presented as a kind of, okay,

24:55.920 --> 24:58.640
here is a theory, here is my explanation,

24:58.640 --> 25:00.600
and it's like, okay, sure, I accept that,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.680
and that's it, you leave it at that.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.920
So a person who understood,

25:05.920 --> 25:07.200
I can run into the Buddha,

25:07.200 --> 25:08.400
would know that,

25:08.400 --> 25:10.720
because that's what understanding is.

25:10.720 --> 25:13.560
So then they wouldn't be teaching as a form of explanation,

25:13.560 --> 25:14.400
and that's the difference,

25:14.400 --> 25:17.200
when you're explaining something,

25:17.200 --> 25:19.520
ah, okay, it makes sense, that's it,

25:19.520 --> 25:21.560
or when you're leading somebody onwards

25:21.560 --> 25:22.760
in their understanding.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.720
So sure, I could compare,

25:28.720 --> 25:32.000
like if Nama Rupa, Vinyalna, with Foward,

25:32.000 --> 25:33.920
it's if, as a whole,

25:33.920 --> 25:36.080
that approach is leading you onwards.

25:37.120 --> 25:41.480
But if we're just doing it for the sake of debate,

25:41.480 --> 25:43.160
like abstractively reasoning,

25:43.160 --> 25:44.200
or whatever, just theory,

25:44.200 --> 25:46.000
or just because it's pleasing to me,

25:46.000 --> 25:46.880
there's just pointless.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.160
Even if we actually talk about them all the time,

25:49.160 --> 25:52.000
we're not, because there is no leading onwards element.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.640
But again, you can see leading onwards,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.520
like when I said about the assumption of the senses,

25:57.520 --> 25:59.160
I could have said,

25:59.160 --> 26:03.800
well, see, that's because you think your senses are yours,

26:03.800 --> 26:04.400
and that's it.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.840
Okay, so I should think my senses are not mine,

26:06.840 --> 26:08.080
and that's it.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.760
But it, that's just linear,

26:10.760 --> 26:11.960
and there is absolutely no lead,

26:11.960 --> 26:14.120
but if I tell you, well actually you have to stop.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.440
You have to see that your senses,

26:16.440 --> 26:19.080
the thought of what you think your senses are,

26:19.080 --> 26:24.080
is inseparable from that material thought, again,

26:24.080 --> 26:29.080
of the flesh, eye, and all of the other other sense bases.

26:30.160 --> 26:34.600
So you have to keep drilling that connection on and on and on.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.720
Not just once, okay, that this is not mine,

26:37.720 --> 26:40.800
but you have to discern it and see dependent upon that.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.720
And then you will have, like if you abandon your senses,

26:44.720 --> 26:47.920
means that the feelings won't be generated,

26:47.920 --> 26:51.680
which means that the mindfulness will not be clouded,

26:51.680 --> 26:54.160
which means the suffering won't arise, and you will feel that,

26:54.160 --> 26:56.840
you will feel the absence of suffering.

26:56.840 --> 27:01.720
So you know, like sure, I could say to myself,

27:01.720 --> 27:03.200
senses are not mine,

27:03.200 --> 27:04.200
but it doesn't make sense,

27:04.200 --> 27:06.160
it makes any no difference to the suffering

27:06.160 --> 27:08.800
that you experience, or that you might experience.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.280
Suffering that you might be liable to, makes no difference.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.320
And if it makes no difference, it means it's not a dharma.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.160
Even if you're actually reading the sutra,

27:18.160 --> 27:20.120
but it's not a dharma.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.440
But if you attempt to things rightly,

27:22.440 --> 27:25.520
and you undo the assumption of your senses,

27:25.520 --> 27:29.560
so through that undoing, you are actually not liable

27:29.560 --> 27:32.560
to that suffering anymore, and you can know that, you know.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.600
This is dharma, because it's directly freeing it from suffering.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.960
But in order to be able to see that, to discern that,

27:38.960 --> 27:41.080
you need to be completely self-transparent

27:41.080 --> 27:44.680
and not act out of this use, simply pleasing to me,

27:44.680 --> 27:46.440
that's why I'm holding it.

27:46.440 --> 27:50.520
So you have to be ready to have some very displeased new views,

27:50.520 --> 27:53.240
some views that will fill you with anxiety

27:53.240 --> 27:55.120
and everything else that follows,

27:55.120 --> 27:57.960
because you're undoing, like your own assumption

27:57.960 --> 28:01.000
of your own very existence, of your own sense of self,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.240
of your own confidence as a person, as a whatever else,

28:04.240 --> 28:06.840
you're undoing all of that,

28:06.840 --> 28:09.960
and using only criteria of absence of suffering.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.360
And you can see like, oh well, this actually,

28:13.360 --> 28:14.880
I'm not just acting because it's pleasing,

28:14.880 --> 28:16.120
this is really the real thing.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.800
And then look at that.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.760
If you were to find out the next moment,

28:20.760 --> 28:22.760
that that is not a real thing,

28:22.760 --> 28:25.360
would you be filled with terror and anxiety?

28:25.360 --> 28:27.200
You would, means it's not a real thing.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.040
No, you'll think.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.520
No, the real thing.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.240
Like, as I said, the approach that you took,

28:37.240 --> 28:40.000
like, oh, I'm gonna hold this view,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.520
because it's pleasing to me.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.120
That's like, okay, that's not good, that's not awesome.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.800
So I'm gonna hold this view,

28:45.800 --> 28:48.280
but I'm not doing it because it's pleasing to me.

28:48.280 --> 28:49.120
Fine?

28:49.120 --> 28:51.200
I might be true, but then look at that.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.160
Look whereby, if that view is taken away from you,

28:54.160 --> 28:55.760
or if you find out that it's wrong,

28:56.720 --> 28:59.360
would you be affected personally?

28:59.360 --> 29:01.400
Like thoroughly, and you realize, yes, I would.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.280
Okay, so that view might not be wrong,

29:03.280 --> 29:04.760
but I'm certainly holding on to it,

29:04.760 --> 29:06.600
because if that view is gone,

29:06.600 --> 29:08.440
I'll experience this anxiety and terror,

29:08.440 --> 29:11.040
which means I need to take it further.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.080
So, in a way, you are still holding

29:13.080 --> 29:14.480
because it's pleasing to you,

29:14.480 --> 29:16.360
even if it's the right view.

29:16.360 --> 29:19.200
But if you're holding a view,

29:19.200 --> 29:24.200
regardless of it giving you pleasure,

29:26.280 --> 29:27.920
or giving you pain.

29:29.520 --> 29:33.200
But yet, it just, you can't see it in the other way,

29:33.200 --> 29:34.960
it just, you know, it's...

29:34.960 --> 29:39.840
Well, first of all, you can, but not hold on, you've used,

29:39.840 --> 29:43.280
because it's not, you can only go beyond it

29:43.280 --> 29:45.080
as an arahant.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.520
But before that, you can only hold the right views

29:47.520 --> 29:49.120
on a kind of wrong views.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.320
Or you can hold the wrong views

29:50.320 --> 29:52.000
and not have any right views.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.480
But, you know, the whole notion of,

29:53.480 --> 29:56.880
oh, I don't hold any views, that's a view.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.440
And that there was that sort of,

29:58.440 --> 30:01.200
that I'm actually referring to, when you said,

30:01.200 --> 30:03.000
oh, he said, you could ask him,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.320
like, so what views do you have?

30:04.320 --> 30:08.480
He said, ah, Master Gautama, I have, what is he saying?

30:09.600 --> 30:11.040
Oh, yeah, I have no, I have no,

30:11.040 --> 30:12.720
he said, he asked me, well, views are pleasing to you,

30:12.720 --> 30:15.520
like, no, Master Gautama, I don't accept any views,

30:15.520 --> 30:18.640
I have no views, no views are pleasing to me.

30:18.640 --> 30:22.040
And he said, well, surely, that view is pleasing to you,

30:22.040 --> 30:25.240
you know, not holding ten of views, it's also a view.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.520
So you had to discern that, in the same sense of,

30:27.520 --> 30:28.960
just stop thinking, I'm not thinking,

30:28.960 --> 30:31.240
well, that's a thought, you're just contradicting yourself

30:31.240 --> 30:32.720
right there and then.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.040
So in the same sense, if you're believing

30:34.040 --> 30:35.280
you're not holding ten of views,

30:35.280 --> 30:37.560
you're kind of in limbo hovering over,

30:37.560 --> 30:40.280
that's a view that you have clearly not aware of.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.920
And for as long as you don't become aware of,

30:42.920 --> 30:44.320
you can't abandon it.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.880
So you have to recognize, you have no choice

30:45.880 --> 30:47.680
but to hold the views.

30:47.680 --> 30:51.000
What you can't use is develop the right views

30:51.000 --> 30:52.600
at the expense of wrong views.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.560
And then hold the right views, then because they're right,

30:55.560 --> 30:58.680
they will take you eventually beyond the views.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.080
And then you become an Arahant,

31:00.080 --> 31:02.440
but even then, I'm not holding any views, no,

31:02.440 --> 31:03.720
I won't be on the views.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.360
So holding, we're not holding, we're both holding,

31:06.360 --> 31:08.080
and now they're holding, they're not holding,

31:08.080 --> 31:10.840
simply doesn't apply anymore, you've dropped it all.

31:12.360 --> 31:15.200
You know, that's another suit, a 38.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.320
Not humanly kind, you know.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.560
Which is, this right view,

31:24.240 --> 31:28.280
as pleasing as it is, as pure as bright.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.720
If you were holding, yeah.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.000
If you were to hold onto this view,

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
you would not be...

31:33.000 --> 31:34.800
Practicing, placing it, yeah.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.720
You would not understand the damage to be a wrath,

31:37.720 --> 31:39.440
yeah, yeah, it's a wrath, yeah.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.080
See, yes.

31:41.080 --> 31:47.560
And that's what would happen to Aryasavakas

31:47.560 --> 31:50.600
who were not, who didn't reach Arahant,

31:50.600 --> 31:52.320
who kind of got complacent,

31:52.320 --> 31:55.040
like so to say, in the suit,

31:55.040 --> 31:57.240
because basically, they got, you know,

31:57.240 --> 31:59.200
and yeah, the great master's sovereignty

31:59.200 --> 32:01.800
has been destroyed, and so on.

32:01.800 --> 32:05.280
And then please do that, which means they won't be pushing

32:05.280 --> 32:08.360
that view further, they'll just hold onto it,

32:08.360 --> 32:10.360
because they're satisfied with what they got,

32:10.360 --> 32:13.360
basically, they got complacent.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.480
So that's what will happen.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.880
So yes, even the right view.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.960
But yeah, oh, so that's not a bad thing.

32:19.960 --> 32:21.320
I mean, it's a bad thing,

32:21.320 --> 32:24.080
from a rather, it's not fully adequate thing

32:24.080 --> 32:26.160
from the point of view of an Arahant,

32:26.160 --> 32:27.240
but from Pratujana.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.080
Yes, please, by all means,

32:29.080 --> 32:30.920
everybody should try and get the right view

32:30.920 --> 32:34.840
and hold onto it daily, rather than the wrong view.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.560
Because actually, holding onto the right view,

32:37.560 --> 32:39.800
it's, well, you can, because it's a right view,

32:39.800 --> 32:40.720
because you have the right view,

32:40.720 --> 32:41.520
you have the right criteria,

32:41.520 --> 32:44.680
you can see that you're holding onto it.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.880
So you can, like not exert yourself in practice further,

32:47.880 --> 32:50.360
but you know, as Pratujana, the danger is,

32:50.360 --> 32:51.480
you don't know that.

32:51.480 --> 32:54.120
You don't know that you're holding onto those views.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.320
And for as long as you don't know,

32:55.320 --> 32:58.120
there's absolutely no way you can abandon them.

32:58.120 --> 33:05.120
So it's much more dangerous.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.480
It's absolutely, you know,

33:15.480 --> 33:18.720
you're going back to something making sense.

33:18.720 --> 33:25.240
I would have, you know, you have faith, I'd get that makes sense.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.200
But there's always your own effort, you have to,

33:27.200 --> 33:30.120
there's always this, your own effort.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.440
So even though it makes sense,

33:32.440 --> 33:34.960
you're also going to be authentic enough to see it.

33:34.960 --> 33:38.840
I'm, there is no, even though it's pleasant,

33:38.840 --> 33:41.440
this idea, this view, this monk says,

33:41.440 --> 33:44.280
and I really believe what he says.

33:45.080 --> 33:49.560
But you know, I don't really experience what he says,

33:49.560 --> 33:54.560
because I would, I would make that effort.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.760
I would make that effort, so how can I really know?

33:56.760 --> 33:58.200
Making that effort is when I say,

33:58.200 --> 34:02.920
ah, you need, you need to do the drilling on and on and on.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.680
Drilling of the right contemplation, right attending,

34:05.680 --> 34:07.640
drilling of not tolerating unwholesome states,

34:07.640 --> 34:10.640
not tolerating essential flows, not all of those are drilling,

34:10.640 --> 34:13.600
all of these hard work, internal work.

34:13.600 --> 34:16.680
And yeah, that's basically 99%.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.080
You need to do that.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.040
And in the same sense, well,

34:20.040 --> 34:23.840
what this, such and such monk said, it makes sense.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.720
Then you start drilling it, you start applying it,

34:25.720 --> 34:27.600
and then you actually know it's wrong,

34:27.600 --> 34:29.280
and then you will know why it's wrong,

34:29.280 --> 34:31.520
and where it's wrong, and how it's wrong.

34:32.560 --> 34:37.560
This is also this kind of, you can actually see what to do.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.360
So this not only makes sense,

34:43.360 --> 34:46.280
but you, you're able to see what you have to do,

34:46.280 --> 34:49.560
but I guess, like, you're leading on with this.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.080
Oh, yeah, that's the other bit in the suit,

34:51.080 --> 34:53.520
it says he measures the task.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.880
You know exactly how much what needs to be done,

34:56.880 --> 34:59.320
what needs the task that he's mentioned,

34:59.320 --> 35:00.360
it makes sense.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.360
Yeah, you know.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.200
That's it.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.520
Oh, he listen, he hears this, okay.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.480
This, this sounds promising.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.720
Then he ponders on it, he gets some understanding

35:09.720 --> 35:11.920
through reasoning and acceptance.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.080
Okay, and by having the understanding,

35:14.080 --> 35:16.600
that's already like almost like a beginning of wisdom.

35:17.600 --> 35:20.120
By having that discernment, then he can, okay,

35:20.120 --> 35:22.680
so this is what needs to be done.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.840
Because most of the people today, like monks or laypeople,

35:25.840 --> 35:26.960
when he comes to practice,

35:26.960 --> 35:31.400
it's just this vast and biggest blur of everything

35:31.400 --> 35:34.400
and nothing, what needs to be done well,

35:34.400 --> 35:39.400
you just, you know, be here, now, yesterday, tomorrow.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.840
Like, as if you have a choice, but to be here now,

35:42.840 --> 35:44.720
where else can you be?

35:44.720 --> 35:45.560
You make marriage.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.560
So it's just this is a big,

35:46.560 --> 35:48.440
it's weird, mystical, why?

35:48.440 --> 35:51.360
Because they haven't measured the task,

35:51.360 --> 35:53.520
but you did as soon as the Buddha would clearly say,

35:53.520 --> 35:55.000
and people would clearly say,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.640
this needs to be done, so you,

35:57.640 --> 35:59.840
and so knowing what needs to be done,

35:59.840 --> 36:04.440
even as protrusion requires some development of wisdom.

36:04.440 --> 36:09.440
So measuring the task is actually quite a significant stage,

36:09.440 --> 36:13.560
so to speak, no, okay, if I do this,

36:13.560 --> 36:16.120
like I could expect that.

36:16.120 --> 36:20.000
So you know, if I were to apply myself in such a manner,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.840
for certain period of time, I don't know exactly for how long,

36:22.840 --> 36:26.880
but if I keep applying myself in this manner to that extent,

36:26.880 --> 36:29.040
I might be on the way to be free from suffering,

36:29.040 --> 36:30.120
and then you do it.

36:30.120 --> 36:33.280
And having it like that, measure the task,

36:33.280 --> 36:36.360
you won't need any external inspiration,

36:36.360 --> 36:39.000
you won't need, like, download talks and poetry

36:39.000 --> 36:42.280
to kind of make you feel energised to practice, no.

36:42.280 --> 36:46.280
You measure the task, you see the end goal, you do it,

36:46.280 --> 36:47.920
and that's why you do it.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.360
And then you can't blame it, you can't actually,

36:50.360 --> 36:53.120
if you aren't blaming your circumstances or...

36:53.120 --> 36:56.400
Oh yeah, no, it becomes personal.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.520
It becomes, like the said, to be known

36:58.520 --> 37:01.280
in the personal individually by the wise,

37:01.280 --> 37:02.920
by those who are developing wisdom,

37:02.920 --> 37:05.600
to measure the task, to apply themselves,

37:05.600 --> 37:07.160
and then to reach the goal.

37:07.160 --> 37:10.400
It's like seeing, you see what's going on.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.880
Oh, there's nothing to be attained,

37:11.880 --> 37:15.600
there is nothing to be done, there is nothing that,

37:15.600 --> 37:17.720
find me the suited, it says that.

37:17.720 --> 37:18.560
You want?

37:18.560 --> 37:19.400
Cause I don't know.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.880
I mean, you find it in other schools of Buddhism and stuff,

37:24.880 --> 37:25.720
and why?

37:25.720 --> 37:27.920
Because they themselves haven't measured the task,

37:27.920 --> 37:31.160
haven't developed discernment to be able

37:31.160 --> 37:33.240
to have the tools to measure the task.

37:34.760 --> 37:37.000
And all that's because they haven't been transparent

37:37.000 --> 37:39.080
from the beginning, self-transparent.

37:39.080 --> 37:42.000
If you were transparent, you would always be coming

37:42.000 --> 37:44.320
from the place of I want to be free from suffering,

37:45.280 --> 37:47.120
which means you'll never cover it up,

37:47.120 --> 37:48.960
so no matter how pleasing the view is,

37:48.960 --> 37:50.360
how pleasing the teacher is,

37:50.360 --> 37:52.880
how is this freeing you from suffering?

37:52.880 --> 37:56.080
I don't know, I'll give it a bit more, more time, more time.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.040
So you're applying yourself,

37:58.040 --> 38:00.240
and if it's still not making any difference to suffering,

38:00.240 --> 38:03.080
you will drop it, you will move on.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.320
Because that criteria is the fundamental,

38:05.320 --> 38:07.880
and that is the criteria that, yes,

38:07.880 --> 38:09.360
the pathogen I can trust,

38:10.360 --> 38:13.480
like full transparent freedom from suffering.

38:13.480 --> 38:16.200
So you're not, okay, this might be freeing you from suffering,

38:16.200 --> 38:17.400
then you stop and think.

38:18.840 --> 38:22.320
If somebody's to take away this particular practice

38:22.320 --> 38:24.560
that I started engaging in, that I think is freeing

38:24.560 --> 38:27.080
from suffering, would I suffer on a kind of that?

38:28.440 --> 38:29.760
And then I would.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.160
So then you practice on that level even further,

38:32.160 --> 38:34.440
and then you'll see what you were doing was actually freeing

38:34.440 --> 38:36.440
from suffering, all you were just holding onto it,

38:36.440 --> 38:37.800
because it was pleasing to you.

38:37.800 --> 38:42.800
But what if you, what if you, you,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.520
do you want to check on that?

38:48.520 --> 38:51.200
Are these going to, I have to bring.

38:51.200 --> 38:56.200
What if you have a view that if you have no one can take away,

38:59.120 --> 39:04.120
that's the right view, that no matter what way you think of it?

39:04.120 --> 39:07.160
Well, you can't actually reverse it,

39:07.160 --> 39:10.080
you can't see things in a different way.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.920
If you, you could try, you would have to come back.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.200
Come, the axis by doubt.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.520
Yeah.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.040
And that is the right view,

39:17.040 --> 39:19.040
when the feather of doubt disappears.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.800
So you can reach the right view

39:23.800 --> 39:28.400
by fully, transparently, doubting any views that you hold.

39:29.880 --> 39:33.840
Like, don't hold back, don't leave anything unturned.

39:33.840 --> 39:36.160
And then that, which is left, cannot be accessed

39:36.160 --> 39:39.240
by that full-on, cultivated doubt.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Yeah.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.480
And you can see, like, you know, you can doubt this,

39:46.480 --> 39:51.000
you can doubt that, but you can doubt the presence of doubt,

39:51.960 --> 39:55.200
which means there is a, there is a thing present,

39:55.200 --> 39:57.800
which means there is a nature of that thing.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.040
And be doubt or something else,

40:00.040 --> 40:02.280
you can doubt the presence of the thing.

40:02.280 --> 40:05.280
And that's what now it pertains to, that's the beginning.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.720
If you think that calls,

40:06.720 --> 40:09.720
and then you'll be just kind of going further or further away

40:09.720 --> 40:11.680
from any doubt, in that sense.

40:14.760 --> 40:15.600
Yes, sir.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.240
Because, well, there is happiness present.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.120
Oh, there is resistance present.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.840
Oh, there is sensuality present.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.080
Oh, there is doubt present.

40:23.080 --> 40:26.120
Well, all those things have become a thing present.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.120
Yeah.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.640
And there's no doubt about that.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.240
And there is no doubt that can even access that.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.120
Like, you can doubt particular aspects,

40:34.120 --> 40:37.440
often a reason thing, but you can doubt the arising of the thing,

40:37.440 --> 40:42.040
which is why the inside of Sotapana comes from the very bottom.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.280
Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of seeing.

40:45.280 --> 40:48.920
Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of seeing.

40:48.920 --> 40:51.920
Doesn't say this, which has the, no, whatever,

40:51.920 --> 40:55.280
be doubt, be sensuality, be happiness, being sent,

40:55.280 --> 41:00.640
whatever has the nature of arising for that reason has the nature of seeing.

41:00.640 --> 41:04.520
Or, rather, for that reason, it's impermanent.

41:04.520 --> 41:05.760
And that's another topic I'm about.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.680
It's spoken about it in different talks as well,

41:07.680 --> 41:11.360
but things are not impermanent because you watch their destruction,

41:11.360 --> 41:12.360
watch their disappearance.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.640
They're impermanent because they are rose.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.080
They came to be.

41:17.080 --> 41:19.000
That's why they're impermanent.

41:19.000 --> 41:28.360
One could have that view, or not doubt that view.

41:28.360 --> 41:40.480
One could see it, but it is impossible to not have...

41:40.480 --> 41:44.320
You don't necessarily release it from Tukka.

41:44.320 --> 41:45.680
Oh, yes.

41:45.680 --> 41:46.680
You won't be.

41:46.680 --> 41:53.520
He takes now repetition of that right view on and on and on,

41:53.520 --> 41:58.120
until it kind of saturates your experience as a whole

41:58.120 --> 42:01.840
and flushes out all the ignorance and origin.

42:01.840 --> 42:05.000
But you can still have no doubt, in a way.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.040
You think that, like, no, you can have?

42:07.040 --> 42:11.000
Well, you can have no doubt, but, like, that's just the first step.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.600
Now, you have to keep applying that view, which is inaccessible to doubt.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.840
But if you're not applying it, you're just holding that view

42:17.840 --> 42:20.880
and you're not doing anything else.

42:20.880 --> 42:21.480
Yeah, sure.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.800
You go to the great view of that beyond the doubt.

42:24.800 --> 42:26.520
But I'm not saying it's a good one.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.680
Well, it's not a sin. And that's why you have even those, like,

42:28.680 --> 42:33.000
Dhamma Nusari and Sadhana Nusari, this kind of contusion is,

42:33.000 --> 42:37.600
they will attain to the path, but they will not sub one as yet.

42:37.600 --> 42:38.960
Is this...

42:38.960 --> 42:43.760
Dhamma Nusari and Sadhana Nusari, whether they came through faith,

42:43.760 --> 42:48.200
or they came through the Dhamma investigation and reasoning.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.600
They will arrive at the path, eventually.

42:50.600 --> 42:53.840
So, yeah, you can get the view, but again, as I said,

42:53.840 --> 42:59.880
it's a gradual drilling repetition that it's sort of, like,

42:59.880 --> 43:05.960
bit by bit, by bit, by bit, undoing your ignorance.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.400
And as the Buddha said, you can't say,

43:07.400 --> 43:10.560
oh, today, my ignorance has been undone this much.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.200
Yesterday, that much, tomorrow, it will be this much.

43:13.200 --> 43:18.720
No, it's like the carpenter using the axe every day for years.

43:18.720 --> 43:23.520
Every day, he grabs that axe, that the handle is wearing thin.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.160
But he can't say, yes, they're different today.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.720
Oh, this is how much it wore off.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.880
But after a year of using it, he can come and wonder, he can look.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.160
Oh, my goodness.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.800
My axe handle is very thin.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.240
Look, completely worn out.

43:41.520 --> 43:51.160
Because, as I said, a person who is, who is gone beyond doubt,

43:51.160 --> 43:59.000
but that person would see, then, that it's, you can't doubt his view,

43:59.000 --> 44:05.160
but he's not getting any further on account of his own effort

44:05.160 --> 44:07.280
that he's making or not making.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.360
That might have strengthened his putting into the practice

44:10.360 --> 44:14.800
or furthering that view, or developing that view.

44:14.800 --> 44:15.280
You know what I mean?

44:15.280 --> 44:18.000
So, not only is you, beyond doubt, but you're also

44:18.000 --> 44:23.360
beyond doubt that any further development is due to my own effort.

44:23.360 --> 44:24.880
Yeah, yeah.

44:24.880 --> 44:28.280
That's why, like, whatever it was to be obtained

44:28.280 --> 44:31.040
by the male and the half of the man in Australia, I've obtained,

44:31.040 --> 44:33.960
basically, it's completely on you.

44:33.960 --> 44:37.160
You know, you can't, you know, it's just others,

44:37.160 --> 44:40.160
like people, and even Alacada's circles,

44:40.160 --> 44:42.200
and anything, it's irrelevant.

44:42.200 --> 44:46.840
For as long as you have the living functioning mind,

44:46.840 --> 44:49.400
as you say, once you get the right view,

44:49.400 --> 44:53.200
there is nothing standing in between you and other handship

44:53.200 --> 44:56.440
except your lack of effort.

44:56.440 --> 44:57.480
Nothing else.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.720
There is nothing else that can come in the way,

44:59.720 --> 45:01.960
which is why it can't be taken away

45:01.960 --> 45:05.320
because it wasn't given to you externally either.

45:05.320 --> 45:09.760
It's something you develop fully, and it's like a one-way,

45:09.760 --> 45:11.040
one-way development.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.360
You can't undo it.

45:12.360 --> 45:19.360
But nothing except yourself stands in the way you get to know this.

45:26.480 --> 45:29.880
I don't know if you remember this quote.

45:29.880 --> 45:39.880
The story says a guard is made free from all troubles

45:39.880 --> 45:42.880
on account of nature.

45:42.880 --> 45:49.880
So we, but the sage is free from all troubles.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.880
On account of his own effort.

45:51.880 --> 45:53.880
So he's better.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.880
He's even stronger than a guard.

45:55.880 --> 45:58.880
Because he's not, well, exactly, he's stronger than a guard

45:58.880 --> 46:00.880
because gold was not strong because they were given.

46:00.880 --> 46:01.880
Yeah, it was just given to him.

46:01.880 --> 46:02.880
You were given, huh?

46:02.880 --> 46:04.880
You think you were granted?

46:04.880 --> 46:09.880
You didn't have to develop anything.

46:09.880 --> 46:10.880
Absolutely.

46:22.880 --> 46:29.880
We've seen the sensors again as external things.

46:29.880 --> 46:33.880
Because if I think about my eye,

46:33.880 --> 46:40.880
I see that as an external thought by my facial eye.

46:40.880 --> 46:45.880
The problem there is that in regard to that thought,

46:45.880 --> 46:49.880
you're having like a tacit, implicit assumption

46:49.880 --> 46:54.880
that the eye is something more internally.

46:54.880 --> 46:56.880
So you can think of those things.

46:56.880 --> 46:59.880
Why do you at the same time assume to find your eye

46:59.880 --> 47:03.880
in the direction of internal inside of you or whatever.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.880
But if you look at yourself in the mirror,

47:05.880 --> 47:07.880
that eye that you see in the mirror,

47:07.880 --> 47:09.880
that is that eye because of which you're able

47:09.880 --> 47:11.880
to look at that eye in the mirror in the first place.

47:11.880 --> 47:15.880
That very reflection there of that flesh-y organ

47:15.880 --> 47:17.880
is that object.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.880
So you're saying it doesn't go further than what?

47:19.880 --> 47:20.880
There is no further than that.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.880
It closes upon itself.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.880
The assumption takes you further into infinity whereby

47:25.880 --> 47:27.880
you would see the reflection of yourself

47:27.880 --> 47:29.880
seeing the reflection of yourself seeing the reflection

47:29.880 --> 47:31.880
and think, wow.

47:31.880 --> 47:35.880
But actually, all the whole thing would be swept in a second

47:35.880 --> 47:38.880
if you remove the flesh-y eye, if you destroy it.

47:38.880 --> 47:40.880
So that whole infinity of your perception

47:40.880 --> 47:42.880
or whatever else, it's impermanent.

47:42.880 --> 47:47.880
It might be infinite, but it doesn't last forever.

47:47.880 --> 47:50.880
Why? Because if flesh-y eyes gone.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.880
Excellent death, sickness, aging, whatever.

47:52.880 --> 47:53.880
Gone.

47:53.880 --> 47:55.880
The whole infinity is gone.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.880
Your sight is gone.

47:57.880 --> 48:01.880
Why? Because that flesh-y eye was that because of which

48:01.880 --> 48:05.880
the whole domain of sight was present.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.880
So that's why that's it.

48:07.880 --> 48:11.880
And you'll never see like a one, two, three, four, five

48:11.880 --> 48:13.880
a linear connection.

48:13.880 --> 48:15.880
So you have to contemplate.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.880
You have to fabricate it in the beginning.

48:17.880 --> 48:19.880
It's abstract, but that's only because it doesn't apply

48:19.880 --> 48:20.880
to your experience.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.880
But you have to make it apply to your experience.

48:22.880 --> 48:26.880
We're going to drill in on and on and on.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.880
Drill in a throat, literally.

48:29.880 --> 48:36.880
Establet, define it, think it, and then establish it.

48:36.880 --> 48:41.880
The thought that those flesh-y organs are that

48:41.880 --> 48:44.880
because of which I am alive here thinking, intending,

48:44.880 --> 48:46.880
looking, smelling, touching.

48:46.880 --> 48:49.880
Those flesh-y organs disappear.

48:49.880 --> 48:55.880
All of this cannot remain standing even for a split-second longer.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.880
And in the beginning, it's an abstract thought.

48:57.880 --> 48:59.880
But you keep drilling it.

48:59.880 --> 49:01.880
Then it will stay longer and longer and longer.

49:01.880 --> 49:03.880
And then when it stays longer enough,

49:03.880 --> 49:06.880
you start seeing things through that thought.

49:06.880 --> 49:09.880
You start seeing things through the right view.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.880
When it takes root.

49:12.880 --> 49:18.880
When you say those senses, those senses of

49:18.880 --> 49:22.880
nothing more than what I experienced now.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.880
That is the senses.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.880
What I say, the flesh organ, that worth.

49:28.880 --> 49:30.880
I think that is it.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.880
That's something you also see through your senses.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.880
But that you can know that is that because of which

49:36.880 --> 49:39.880
your senses are there in the first place.

49:39.880 --> 49:40.880
Turning.

49:40.880 --> 49:41.880
Well, it's here.

49:41.880 --> 49:44.880
Yeah, it's like kind of closes upon itself.

49:44.880 --> 49:54.880
It doesn't go, it's not anywhere else, out of there.

49:54.880 --> 49:58.880
Right there, right now.

49:58.880 --> 50:01.880
You can look yourself in the mirror.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.880
Look at your eyes in the mirror.

50:03.880 --> 50:05.880
And you'll see how you assume,

50:05.880 --> 50:08.880
like as if you were behind them inside somewhere,

50:08.880 --> 50:10.880
left or right.

50:10.880 --> 50:13.880
But if you then don't let your thought

50:13.880 --> 50:16.880
or rather if you anchor your thought

50:16.880 --> 50:19.880
in that reflection of that flesh organ

50:19.880 --> 50:23.880
as the original determination.

50:23.880 --> 50:27.880
Yeah, that's our solution.

50:27.880 --> 50:31.880
Yeah.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.880
So if you look yourself in the mirror

50:33.880 --> 50:34.880
and you see your eyes,

50:34.880 --> 50:37.880
and then you can okay this whole like the face

50:37.880 --> 50:39.880
and the reflection, the nose and stuff,

50:39.880 --> 50:41.880
you can kind of see that,

50:41.880 --> 50:43.880
okay, that's just organ.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.880
But pin it down to the eyes in your eyes

50:45.880 --> 50:48.880
and you kind of think the life is behind that

50:48.880 --> 50:50.880
eye, your sense of self, you are.

50:50.880 --> 50:51.880
But if you look at it,

50:51.880 --> 50:52.880
and what you see,

50:52.880 --> 50:54.880
you see a black circle,

50:54.880 --> 50:56.880
a blind dot.

50:56.880 --> 50:58.880
In the center of the flesh,

50:58.880 --> 50:59.880
you all know.

50:59.880 --> 51:00.880
And you realize,

51:00.880 --> 51:01.880
that's it.

51:01.880 --> 51:02.880
It stops there.

51:02.880 --> 51:03.880
It starts there, it doesn't go beyond there.

51:03.880 --> 51:05.880
It's that flesh that I'm looking at,

51:05.880 --> 51:08.880
is that because of which I'm able to look.

51:08.880 --> 51:11.880
So there are two dimensions,

51:11.880 --> 51:12.880
simultaneous pleasant.

51:12.880 --> 51:14.880
One is this material dimension of the flesh eye,

51:14.880 --> 51:17.880
and the one is like simultaneously present dimension

51:17.880 --> 51:20.880
of awareness in regard to it.

51:20.880 --> 51:23.880
But there is not a collinear that behind the eyes

51:23.880 --> 51:25.880
it goes and you look in eyes

51:25.880 --> 51:27.880
at whether the window is a soul.

51:27.880 --> 51:31.880
And they're just a flat wall.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.880
And it's so cool.

51:33.880 --> 51:35.880
The soul is in front of it.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.880
The thoughts are in front of it.

51:37.880 --> 51:38.880
They can't access that measure.

51:38.880 --> 51:40.880
They can't enter it.

51:40.880 --> 51:43.880
They separate the main.

51:43.880 --> 51:48.880
But it's that assumption of that quick eye movement

51:48.880 --> 51:49.880
that makes you,

51:49.880 --> 51:51.880
well, it makes you maintain that assumption.

51:51.880 --> 51:55.880
Sorry, it's not assumption of quick eyes move fast.

51:55.880 --> 51:59.880
It helps you maintain that assumption easily.

51:59.880 --> 52:03.880
Because your intentionality is measured by the movement.

52:03.880 --> 52:04.880
Things you do.

52:04.880 --> 52:05.880
Things you intend with your body,

52:05.880 --> 52:07.880
your body, your speech, your mind.

52:07.880 --> 52:09.880
Say your whole body is paralyzed.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.880
You can always like move the eyes.

52:11.880 --> 52:13.880
It's basically when the eyes are motionless,

52:13.880 --> 52:14.880
well, it's dead.

52:14.880 --> 52:18.880
Like eyes are dead.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.880
But even those eyes,

52:19.880 --> 52:21.880
the quickest movement,

52:21.880 --> 52:24.880
it's still just a flesh yoga.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.880
In the same sense, your hand is,

52:26.880 --> 52:28.880
your nails are, your hair is.

52:28.880 --> 52:31.880
Your spectacles are, your robes are.

52:31.880 --> 52:35.880
Flesh, material, matter,

52:35.880 --> 52:37.880
rupa.

52:37.880 --> 52:40.880
But this matter is that because of which

52:40.880 --> 52:43.880
there is that awareness in regard to it anyway.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.880
In the first place.

52:46.880 --> 52:50.880
So it's just like two completely separate

52:50.880 --> 52:52.880
domains of matter

52:52.880 --> 52:55.880
and then awareness in regard to the matter

52:55.880 --> 52:57.880
is separable from each other.

52:57.880 --> 52:59.880
You can't have one without your inconceivable.

52:59.880 --> 53:02.880
You can't just think of matter because in a sense,

53:02.880 --> 53:03.880
you're thinking of matter

53:03.880 --> 53:05.880
which means there's awareness in regard to matter.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.880
No, can you just have pure awareness,

53:07.880 --> 53:08.880
which is ridiculous.

53:08.880 --> 53:10.880
Can you have pure awareness

53:10.880 --> 53:11.880
if your matter is destroyed?

53:11.880 --> 53:12.880
You can't.

53:12.880 --> 53:13.880
You can't.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.880
You can assume that there is a pure awareness

53:15.880 --> 53:16.880
that divine and whatever else,

53:16.880 --> 53:17.880
there isn't.

53:17.880 --> 53:19.880
But you see yourself in regard to your body?

53:19.880 --> 53:20.880
Yes, certainly.

53:20.880 --> 53:22.880
It will always remain an assumption

53:22.880 --> 53:25.880
because you can never find out.

53:25.880 --> 53:28.880
That there is an assumption,

53:28.880 --> 53:29.880
an assumption,

53:29.880 --> 53:30.880
a sorry, an awareness

53:30.880 --> 53:31.880
free from your

53:31.880 --> 53:33.880
free from the material

53:33.880 --> 53:35.880
aspect of life

53:35.880 --> 53:36.880
of your body.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.880
There isn't.

53:38.880 --> 53:39.880
Not in good faith,

53:39.880 --> 53:40.880
that is,

53:40.880 --> 53:41.880
because you can't,

53:41.880 --> 53:43.880
if you look at it,

53:43.880 --> 53:45.880
if you look at your experience as a whole

53:45.880 --> 53:46.880
and even if you conceive it,

53:46.880 --> 53:48.880
no matter how pleasing that conception is,

53:48.880 --> 53:52.880
that your awareness can be separate,

53:52.880 --> 53:54.880
the very reality of your practice

53:54.880 --> 53:57.880
of the present moment shows you that,

53:57.880 --> 53:58.880
well,

53:58.880 --> 54:00.880
I'm thinking that my awareness is separate

54:00.880 --> 54:02.880
while I'm all determined,

54:02.880 --> 54:03.880
but this matter,

54:03.880 --> 54:07.880
thus, I'm not separate.

54:07.880 --> 54:08.880
So you can only assume it,

54:08.880 --> 54:09.880
in the same sense,

54:09.880 --> 54:11.880
you can only assume the matter

54:11.880 --> 54:13.880
as independent of you.

54:13.880 --> 54:14.880
Because that's a thought,

54:14.880 --> 54:15.880
which is you,

54:15.880 --> 54:16.880
in that sense.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.880
So that's why a matter

54:17.880 --> 54:24.880
finds footing.

54:24.880 --> 54:25.880
It finds footing,

54:25.880 --> 54:28.880
basically, in your experience.

54:28.880 --> 54:29.880
Because you provided,

54:29.880 --> 54:31.880
you assumed it.

54:31.880 --> 54:32.880
But if you see,

54:32.880 --> 54:33.880
the flesh-y eye,

54:33.880 --> 54:35.880
he's saying pure matter.

54:35.880 --> 54:37.880
Well, the four great elements find footing,

54:37.880 --> 54:38.880
which is how you conceive

54:38.880 --> 54:41.880
the existence of matter.

54:41.880 --> 54:43.880
So you assume the eyes are yours,

54:43.880 --> 54:45.880
means those eyes have found the foot,

54:45.880 --> 54:46.880
those flesh-y lumps,

54:46.880 --> 54:48.880
organs have found the footing,

54:48.880 --> 54:49.880
they exist for you,

54:49.880 --> 54:53.880
their mind.

54:53.880 --> 54:56.880
But as I said,

54:56.880 --> 54:58.880
all you're going to see,

54:58.880 --> 54:59.880
flesh-y eyes,

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
moving left or right,

55:00.880 --> 55:01.880
whatever,

55:01.880 --> 55:02.880
with a black iris

55:02.880 --> 55:04.880
in the center.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.880
But all of that is out there.

55:06.880 --> 55:07.880
There is nothing,

55:07.880 --> 55:08.880
like if you go through

55:08.880 --> 55:09.880
that black iris,

55:09.880 --> 55:10.880
you just find, you know,

55:10.880 --> 55:11.880
blood and liquid,

55:11.880 --> 55:12.880
whatever else,

55:12.880 --> 55:16.880
eyes have.

55:16.880 --> 55:17.880
So there is no,

55:17.880 --> 55:18.880
there is that direction of matter,

55:18.880 --> 55:21.880
and that's it.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.880
If you drill further,

55:23.880 --> 55:24.880
you'll find a matter,

55:24.880 --> 55:25.880
more matter,

55:25.880 --> 55:26.880
or same matter,

55:26.880 --> 55:27.880
depending on how generally

55:27.880 --> 55:30.880
you look at it.

55:30.880 --> 55:31.880
So what you have to do

55:31.880 --> 55:32.880
is stop assuming

55:32.880 --> 55:34.880
that you are behind that matter.

55:34.880 --> 55:35.880
And you can stop assuming

55:35.880 --> 55:37.880
that you are behind that matter,

55:37.880 --> 55:39.880
if you drill long enough

55:39.880 --> 55:40.880
thought that you are not

55:40.880 --> 55:42.880
behind that matter,

55:42.880 --> 55:43.880
where you have to keep drilling it,

55:43.880 --> 55:44.880
and drilling it,

55:44.880 --> 55:45.880
and drilling it

55:45.880 --> 55:50.880
until it takes the root.

55:50.880 --> 55:51.880
And when it does,

55:51.880 --> 55:52.880
then see you're unized,

55:52.880 --> 55:53.880
your own movement,

55:53.880 --> 55:54.880
your own senses will not

55:54.880 --> 55:55.880
reduce the assumption

55:55.880 --> 55:57.880
of self behind those senses.

55:57.880 --> 56:22.880
So there is both of that.

56:22.880 --> 56:29.880
It's not descending into the mouth.

56:29.880 --> 56:32.880
That's a whole.

56:32.880 --> 56:34.880
Not descending into your eyes.

56:34.880 --> 56:35.880
Not descending into eyes.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.880
Not descending into matter.

56:37.880 --> 56:40.880
Not taking up matter.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.880
Not assuming it.

56:42.880 --> 56:44.880
But in more practical terms,

56:44.880 --> 56:47.880
being mindful of your body as a whole

56:47.880 --> 56:49.880
means your mind won't descend into it.

56:49.880 --> 56:50.880
So to speak,

56:50.880 --> 56:52.880
whereby you end up acting

56:52.880 --> 56:53.880
performing bodily acts

56:53.880 --> 56:55.880
carelessly.

56:55.880 --> 56:57.880
Not descending into your mouth.

56:57.880 --> 56:58.880
Literally, your mind

56:58.880 --> 57:00.880
not descending into your mouth,

57:00.880 --> 57:02.880
will make you aware of what you're saying

57:02.880 --> 57:04.880
and what is coming out of your mouth.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.880
So you won't make you act carelessly.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.880
And then not having your

57:08.880 --> 57:09.880
chip that descends

57:09.880 --> 57:12.880
like in your own mind.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.880
Not getting complacent there,

57:14.880 --> 57:16.880
which means that even your thoughts

57:16.880 --> 57:17.880
you'll be aware of

57:17.880 --> 57:19.880
and you won't be thinking carelessly.

57:19.880 --> 57:24.880
Because if you don't descend

57:24.880 --> 57:29.880
or mindful in a proper way

57:29.880 --> 57:33.880
of your mind as an external

57:33.880 --> 57:36.880
seeing it externally,

57:36.880 --> 57:39.880
in a proper way,

57:39.880 --> 57:46.880
just holding that way of seeing.

57:46.880 --> 57:51.880
Then you start really

57:51.880 --> 57:53.880
talking about giants.

57:53.880 --> 57:54.880
So that's...

57:54.880 --> 57:55.880
Yeah, yeah.

57:55.880 --> 57:57.880
Like if you make a practice out of it

57:57.880 --> 57:59.880
out of establishing your mind

57:59.880 --> 58:01.880
well upon those certain things,

58:01.880 --> 58:05.880
like thinking and pondering,

58:05.880 --> 58:08.880
overcoming the speech determination

58:08.880 --> 58:10.880
and so on, then yeah.

58:10.880 --> 58:11.880
But there are many different ways

58:11.880 --> 58:13.880
of establishing your mind.

58:13.880 --> 58:15.880
Janas are just one of them.

58:15.880 --> 58:16.880
Like you know, establishing your mind

58:16.880 --> 58:18.880
upon the perception of forest.

58:18.880 --> 58:19.880
So when you're going to town,

58:19.880 --> 58:20.880
none of the perceptions

58:20.880 --> 58:21.880
that come from the town

58:21.880 --> 58:22.880
can access you,

58:22.880 --> 58:23.880
or bother you,

58:23.880 --> 58:24.880
or cause you harm,

58:24.880 --> 58:25.880
because your mind is

58:25.880 --> 58:26.880
establishing upon the

58:26.880 --> 58:29.880
great perception of forest.

58:29.880 --> 58:30.880
Then you recognize,

58:30.880 --> 58:32.880
okay, so I'm free from the disturbances

58:32.880 --> 58:34.880
that come based on the perceptions

58:34.880 --> 58:35.880
from the town.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.880
But if there are perceptions

58:37.880 --> 58:38.880
that if there are disturbances

58:38.880 --> 58:39.880
coming on a kind of perception

58:39.880 --> 58:40.880
in the forest,

58:40.880 --> 58:42.880
I will be disturbed.

58:42.880 --> 58:44.880
So why don't I develop my mind

58:44.880 --> 58:45.880
and establish my mind

58:45.880 --> 58:46.880
upon something even greater?

58:46.880 --> 58:47.880
So that then even forest

58:47.880 --> 58:49.880
cannot disturb me.

58:49.880 --> 58:50.880
So then you can establish your mind

58:50.880 --> 58:52.880
upon the perception of Earth.

58:52.880 --> 58:54.880
Very establishing your mind

58:54.880 --> 58:56.880
on the perception of Earth.

58:56.880 --> 58:59.880
Does it mean actually

58:59.880 --> 59:02.880
holding the perception of Earth

59:02.880 --> 59:03.880
infantibly, personally?

59:03.880 --> 59:04.880
No.

59:04.880 --> 59:05.880
It's basically finding it,

59:05.880 --> 59:08.880
like discerning it in things.

59:08.880 --> 59:09.880
So then you don't need to hold it

59:09.880 --> 59:10.880
because it's already implied

59:10.880 --> 59:11.880
in those things.

59:11.880 --> 59:13.880
You're not fabricating anything.

59:13.880 --> 59:14.880
You're not creating it.

59:14.880 --> 59:15.880
The most obvious,

59:15.880 --> 59:18.880
maybe a bit crude example,

59:18.880 --> 59:20.880
would be, well,

59:20.880 --> 59:22.880
what is town

59:22.880 --> 59:24.880
and forest

59:24.880 --> 59:26.880
and the mountains

59:26.880 --> 59:28.880
and the oceans

59:28.880 --> 59:29.880
for that matter

59:29.880 --> 59:30.880
having common.

59:30.880 --> 59:31.880
Yes.

59:31.880 --> 59:32.880
Yes.

59:32.880 --> 59:33.880
Well, it's in the reason thing.

59:33.880 --> 59:34.880
Right.

59:34.880 --> 59:36.880
What is there the reason thing?

59:36.880 --> 59:37.880
Those are the reason things.

59:37.880 --> 59:38.880
What are they having common?

59:38.880 --> 59:40.880
Well, they do having common the fact

59:40.880 --> 59:42.880
that they're on Earth.

59:42.880 --> 59:44.880
They're part of Earth.

59:44.880 --> 59:49.880
They have the solid aspect.

59:49.880 --> 59:52.880
That phenomenon of solidity

59:52.880 --> 59:54.880
or immobility

59:54.880 --> 59:56.880
or Earth,

59:56.880 --> 59:58.880
you want to call it,

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880
you establish your mind upon that.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.880
It's an abstraction now

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.880
because your mind is unestablished.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880
But if you have it at the background

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.880
of your mind,

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.880
like anchored in the notion of solid

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.880
in everything,

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.880
even the runny water,

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.880
your mind will get established.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.880
That's how the casinos work,

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.880
in the same sense.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.880
That's what casinos are.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.880
So you would establish your mind

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.880
in something that comes

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:26.880
on a particular level

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.880
can disturb you

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880
because your mind

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880
has been established

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.880
to that much greater

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.880
element of solidity

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.880
in everything

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.880
particular that you're experiencing.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.880
So you literally surpassed

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.880
the whole domain of particular things,

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880
which is everything,

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.880
or whatever.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.880
But if you

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.880
have had a thought

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.880
like the other,

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.880
well, you establish your mind

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.880
on a thought-general thought.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.880
So any thought that you have,

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.880
or you establish your mind

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.880
on mind.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.880
Well, there would be the casinos consciousness,

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.880
which is the most refined of all of them

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.880
and they would come kind of last.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.880
The thing is,

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.880
you can just establish your mind

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880
upon the general experience

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.880
as a whole right here right now.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.880
But make sure that it's not divorced

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.880
from that material aspect.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.880
The material end of it,

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.880
so to speak.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880
So that's why,

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.880
if you come from the material end of it,

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.880
you'll make sure you don't overlook it.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.880
So you are here now.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.880
If there is any disturbance to arise,

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.880
it would be on account of your presence here.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.880
On the head,

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.880
or in the central street,

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:46.880
I'm going this area,

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.880
or whatever.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.880
Obviously,

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.880
now you have, like,

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.880
phones,

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.880
emails,

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.880
stuff like that.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.880
So disturbance can arise.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.880
But again,

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.880
even that would arise

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.880
through your current situation here.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.880
Basically,

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880
on account of your senses,

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.880
on account of things

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.880
that can actually be through your senses.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.880
You can abandon your senses.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:08.880
But then nothing that enters your senses

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.880
will pertain to you,

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.880
it will pertain to the abandoned senses.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.880
So it's not yours,

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.880
not your problem,

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.880
not your suffering.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.880
So that's why there are many different ways

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.880
of establishing your mind,

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.880
but it's the same principle

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.880
of establishing your mind.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.880
That's why the Buddha,

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.880
when he spoke about the casinos,

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.880
he would go out,

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.880
otherwise,

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880
manage to establish

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.880
his mind upon the great element of earth,

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880
on account of that,

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.880
he abandoned everything in failure to it.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.880
And what is inferior

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.880
to the phenomenon of earth,

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.880
that thought of earth,

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.880
gender of earth,

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.880
you basically,

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.880
anything more particular

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880
than that is inferior

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.880
to that phenomenon of earth.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.880
And then he said,

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.880
but obviously,

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.880
he can be still

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.880
liable to disturbance

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.880
on account of that,

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.880
gender of phenomenon,

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880
obviously,

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.880
it's much less disturbance

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880
than the particular.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.880
This disturbance,

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880
as they can arise,

01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.880
if you're not

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.880
established upon the element of earth.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.880
But then,

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.880
that thought that has seen

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.880
the gratification,

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.880
the tension,

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880
this cave,

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.880
in regard to the casinos of earth,

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.880
seen that he knew it,

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.880
and he won't be on through that knowledge,

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.880
so he's not bothered

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:16.880
by the either.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.880
So, yeah,

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.880
there is establishing mind upon a casina,

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.880
or whatever,

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.880
and then there is no event,

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.880
as well.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880
So in time,

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.880
it's very just not descending into a thing.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.880
Well, not, yeah,

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.880
not collapsing,

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.880
mindfulness,

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.880
or like,

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.880
and collapsing mindfulness,

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.880
doesn't mean that, you know,

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.880
you need to constantly keep your mind in front of you.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.880
No, it means you need to anchor your mind.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.880
So, you can,

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.880
whether you're talking now,

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880
sit,

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880
standing,

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880
walking,

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:50.880
anybody posture,

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.880
means the body is there,

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.880
means,

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.880
the earth element is there,

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.880
means,

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.880
the water element is there,

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.880
means,

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880
the fire element is there,

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.880
means,

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880
the air element is there.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.880
You can take any of it.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.880
They're kind of slightly more defined,

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880
but,

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880
you can just be,

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880
sorry,

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880
you know,

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:12.880
you don't even take any of them,

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.880
it's just take the body,

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880
the body is there.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:15.880
That's enough.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:16.880
You don't even have to take the body,

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.880
just take this kind of posture is there,

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.880
when that posture changes,

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.880
take that posture is there,

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.880
because that's the thing.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.880
Whatever these step-onses

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880
can enter you,

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
right now,

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880
you would be,

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880
while you're sitting.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.880
It would be,

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.880
while your body is seated,

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.880
the senses are liable to such and such.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.880
So, you anchor your mind,

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.880
in the seated position of your body.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.880
When you get up,

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880
you anchor your mind.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.880
Or,

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880
you anchor your mind

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.880
in the notion of the body is there.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.880
And obviously,

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.880
if you are thinking it in front of you,

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.880
you're not anchored.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.880
You're anchored when you stop thinking it,

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.880
when you're just discerning it,

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.880
when you're just seeing it

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.880
in the background of your mind.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880
Then,

01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880
that's what means being anchored.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.880
Literally,

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.880
you throw an anchor,

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880
and then you forget about it,

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.880
because you're anchored.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.880
But you know that it's there.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.880
You don't have to keep pulling it out and throwing it.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.880
You don't have to keep holding onto it,

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.880
because it's anchored.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880
Okay, leave.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880
Let the boat float,

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.880
left and right,

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.880
whatever it wants to go.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:16.880
If it goes too far,

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:17.880
it starts dragging the anchor,

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.880
I,

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.880
if it's easy to be anchored,

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.880
then restart it.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.880
Reestablish your mind.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.880
And I'm not talking about

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.880
four, like sitting, you know, cross-legged,

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.880
and I'm talking about

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.880
daily life,

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.880
anchoring your mind,

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.880
because that's what establishing your mind is.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.880
Like, he enters and abides,

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.880
the first genre.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.880
He enters and abides this.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.880
He establishes his mind,

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.880
like, enters and abides the perceptions of forest,

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.880
and then he goes to the town

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.880
for picked up out of whatever else,

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.880
and he's not bothered by anything in that town,

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.880
because his mind is still fully anchored

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.880
in the perceptions of the forest.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.880
So it's no question

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.880
of acting and doing stuff

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.880
while you're establishing,

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.880
because that's how it works.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.880
That's what establishment means.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.880
Now, it's like,

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.880
oh, I can establish my mind only

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.880
when I don't do anything,

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.880
clock the door,

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:17.880
and just sit and stare at the wall.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.880
Because it's discerning,

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.880
the more general.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.880
So whether you're here

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.880
or there or here and there,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.880
that means your body has to be there.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.880
Have a notion of your body.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.880
Let it be as remote as it wants to be,

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.880
but have it present in the back of your mind,

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.880
what are you doing other things?

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880
And that's the important bit,

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.880
while.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.880
Because that's how you can discern

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.880
this principle of simultaneous presence.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880
Now, but I'll stop this

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.880
because I'm doing that.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.880
You stop only on wholesome stuff.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.880
Because that obviously

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.880
undermines the whole picture.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880
But then,

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.880
while you're anchored,

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.880
or even if you don't do anything,

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.880
that's a form of doing.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.880
Okay.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.880
I am refraining from activity,

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.880
which is my current activity.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.880
So while my mind is anchored,

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.880
established in the presence of the body there,

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.880
I'm refraining from any particular activity.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.880
Fine.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.880
As long as you're mindful.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880
In that correct sense.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.880
Not mindful like in a,

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.880
like modern psychology sense,

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.880
or whatever new age sense,

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.880
or just be mindful.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.880
Mindfulness needs to be understood.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880
The principle of anchoring needs to be

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.880
a bit sati-patanas.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.880
And for that, you need the right view.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.880
So while you're sitting here,

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.880
thinking trying to formulate the next question,

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.880
or the same more to glorification,

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.880
you can still have a vague distance

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.880
and the biggest notion of your body present

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.880
at the back of your mind.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.880
And that's practice of anchoring.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.880
Because that doesn't require the direct effort.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.880
Because if it's a direct effort,

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.880
it means it's not anchoring.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880
So yeah, you start with the direct effort,

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.880
only to leave it

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.880
and kind of seep in the background

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:17.880
with our losing sight of it.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.880
And eventually it becomes effortless

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.880
because you can't lose the sight of it.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.880
Because the particular instances of this body

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.880
are maintaining the nature of

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.880
bodies there.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.880
So it's right there in front of you.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.880
Anyhow.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880
The earth element is right there

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.880
for as long as you're alive.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.880
So you have to keep thinking about it.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.880
But you need to let it go in the background

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.880
and then just certainly there.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.880
And when it's certainly there,

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.880
then well, that kind of becomes a foreground almost.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.880
Your mind is established.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.880
You see the boundary.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880
If something is present,

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.880
you see the boundary, I think.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.880
What do you mean?

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.880
You see the body.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.880
Everything else is happening.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.880
But what do you mean by boundary?

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.880
I guess the extent.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.880
Ah, the extent of it.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.880
Well, whatever is happening,

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880
whatever is happening,

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880
whatever might happen,

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.880
it will happen for as long as

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.880
or on account of the presence of the body right here right there.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.880
Right now.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880
So you don't just say,

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880
you don't have to chase after it.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.880
You don't have to, oh,

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.880
how did this happen in the past?

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880
How did you move this head?

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880
No, you know.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.880
For as long as,

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.880
that's what an other hand

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.880
would kind of completely remove the ignorance whatsoever.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880
He said,

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880
any disturbance that is left

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.880
are on account of this

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.880
like leaking body right here

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880
until that body breaks apart

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.880
and then even that won't be.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.880
But that disturbance for him

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.880
is just the disturbance of, you know,

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.880
pain, enduring, and so on.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.880
Not disturbance in terms of causing him,

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.880
suffering and duke,

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.880
he's beyond that.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.880
He's just a nuisance.

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880
Any nuisance that was left

01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.880
is on account of this body

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.880
for as long as it's functioning.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.880
And that breaks apart.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880
That's it.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.880
There won't be another body taking up.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.880
Does it?

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.880
Yeah, things like,

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.880
if one does practice correctly,

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.880
well, there's no assumption.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.880
There's no assuming.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.880
The senses.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.880
You're practicing in a way.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.880
So, mindfulness is not becoming confused.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.880
You could experience nibbana.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.880
Yeah.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.880
But it's not about experience nibbana.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880
Yeah.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880
But it's not established.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.880
It's not established in exactly.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880
Yeah.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880
That's why,

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.880
putugenus can experience nibbana.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880
It's nibbana.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880
But because the putugenus

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880
there won't be a nibbana.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.880
But in terms of experience,

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.880
it is that which nibbana is.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880
That's that.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880
Imagine my hundred.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.880
Oh, I forgot.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.880
Long time ago.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880
Hundred and something.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.880
Hundred and twenty.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.880
Twenty, maybe.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.880
When he said that,

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.880
when he talks about different,

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880
different establishments

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880
that putugenus can have,

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880
but because he conceives them

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:16.880
to be his, for him,

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.880
he assumes them.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.880
So, he goes to the point,

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880
where he says,

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880
he thinks,

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.880
I am, this is nibbana.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880
I am nibbana.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880
I am entering nibbana.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.880
This nibbana is mine.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880
And the Buddha said,

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880
although,

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.880
that is actually nibbana,

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880
what he's talking about.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.880
He is not established in it.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
Not descending,

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.880
nor having it developed,

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880
because he's still thinking,

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880
I am.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.880
So, nibbana is just basically

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.880
experienced without read-aversion delusion.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.880
Imagine if you establish yourself

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.880
in that twenty-four-seven.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.880
Until it takes its roots

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.880
and then it just takes,

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.880
it goes off on its own.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.880
And you can drop the whole thing.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.880
And there is absolutely no cracks

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.880
in the wall anymore

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.880
that nothing can enter you.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.880
It's just dumb.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.880
And that's what nibbana is.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.880
That's why sometimes

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.880
all the Buddha

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.880
would give would be the general instruction,

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.880
oh, I'm staying from anything unwholesome.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.880
Cultivate wholesome.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.880
Thank you, Lord.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.880
I'm going to retreat now

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880
for three months

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880
and practice this profound teaching

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.880
just gave me,

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.880
and then they come out,

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.880
and they're all hands.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.880
Just that.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.880
Because fundamentally,

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880
it is just that,

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.880
but you have to stick to it.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880
I stick to it to the point

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:38.880
of complete self-transparency,

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.880
no maintaining of beliefs

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.880
and views on a kind of

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.880
being pleasant to you,

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.880
no maintaining on a kind of

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.880
protection of anxiety

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.880
because you're afraid,

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.880
no maintaining it,

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.880
no maintaining on a kind of

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.880
form,

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880
well,

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.880
sensuality,

01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880
fear,

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880
anything.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.880
You have to really

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.880
open up internally

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.880
for it,

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.880
and stick to it.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.880
And it will not do things,

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880
and then you will see

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880
it and do it,

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:17.880
and then you know that it's working.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880
But yeah, understanding

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880
what nibbana is,

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.880
like, not just all this,

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880
but knowing,

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880
rightly, what nibbana is,

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.880
are in not appropriating it,

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.880
as putuginana.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.880
It means to become

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.880
a solid one.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:31.880
Now establishing yourself

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.880
in that nibbana eventually,

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.880
means becoming another one.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.880
Because you're not

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.880
assuming the senses

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.880
as there is a

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.880
restraining the senses,

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.880
guiding the senses in a way.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.880
Well, guiding the senses in

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.880
a restraining will prevent

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.880
the proliferation of that assumption.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.880
But obviously, just restraint

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.880
for somebody who doesn't know

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.880
what else to look for,

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.880
you want to mind too much more.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.880
Yeah, guiding the senses in a sense.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.880
Guiding so you prevent the kind of

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.880
heaviest that you know,

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.880
you should know a wrongly

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880
based upon the wrong assumptions,

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.880
preventing them from spreading

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.880
and being establishing

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.880
and just harassing you.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.880
And obviously, when you are not

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.880
leaking left and right,

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.880
then you'll address what's

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.880
there contained.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.880
So yeah, that's what is

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880
strained.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.880
CLI has to come first.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.880
And if I read the translation,

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.880
I'm dying calm.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.880
I'm dying.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.880
Because things are not

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.880
wavy, you know,

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.880
pushed around in the bushes.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.880
You see the extent of things.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.880
And that's not going to

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.880
jump in over there,

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.880
assuming more than there is.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.880
Yeah, the proliferation.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880
From left and right,

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.880
up and down.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.880
Fueled by design and craving

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.880
and confusion and doubt.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.880
And all the other features.

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:35.880
And all the other features.
