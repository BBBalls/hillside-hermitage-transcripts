1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,040
Yeah, what is craving maybe? Like I said today, that craving, understanding craving was

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:20,240
seen, I was seeing it as very unattractive. So I started off with a super reflection and

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,440
came down to, what is unattractive in all things as craving in regard to that is disgusting

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,720
because of the things that it does. The things that it implies, things that it implies

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,680
you get caught up in. Yeah. The self, the whole mission is everything. Yeah. So cravings

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,120
is unattractive. Well, there is how it should be really. All of the things, what approach

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,640
you take, it will end up leading to the same conclusions. And that's like how I don't

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,280
have to come in. It's just, whatever, some people have become skilled in sense-based,

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,520
skilled in this. All for the purpose of just revealing the same things. So you're not

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:10,960
going to develop any new insights. You might develop new aspects of the same insights,

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,560
depending on what approaches you take. But the point is you just, to pursue whichever

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:25,320
aspect you acquire till the end, till the craving is gone and you're another. It's all

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,320
the lighting. Well, yeah. It's kind of inseparable from what we spoke about the light in the

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:44,840
nature of craving. If you take the light for granted, you crave. If you don't even

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,720
see the light as phenomena, the reason, what is the light? The joy, the light. That's

16
00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:05,520
already means craving is there. So the important thing is to not fall into a trap of thinking

17
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,920
linearly. Like, oh, first I felt, then I had the attitude of craving, then I'm delighting,

18
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,560
then I'm as holding, then I get attached, then whatever there is now. It's all like within

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,720
this, when this, this is, it's all the pateats of a father. So you might describe different

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,080
aspects differently. But the point of it is that simultaneously present. So, presence

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:39,320
of feeling means presence of craving for a putugina. And you can think of it, even in terms

22
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:58,880
of, like what we spoke just a couple of hours ago, keeping yourself to, keeping yourself

23
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,440
bound to a domain of centrality makes you not able to whatever arises in that domain.

24
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,880
So keeping yourself bound to the domain of feelings makes yourself liable to whatever

25
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:23,080
feelings arise. So even if you don't necessarily go after the feelings, the fact that you feel,

26
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,880
that feeling is appropriate, that feeling is mine, feeling is me, feeling is I am, makes

27
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,920
you liable to the other possibilities of that feeling that you're appropriating now. So

28
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,000
when that changes, you won't be able to escape it. When that feeling changes, you won't

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,200
be able to escape that change. So you'll be affected by it. In other words, if feeling

30
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,480
changes for even more pleasure, you won't be able to remain indifferent, you'll be pulled,

31
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,800
you'll be hooked in further. If feeling changes to explain, you'll be suffering, you'll

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,560
be affected. And the fact that you are affected in the first place, that's what already

33
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,080
what suffering is, that's what duke is. So the possibility, the fact that you won't

34
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,440
be able to escape the possibility when it arises, that's duke. Why? Because you have no control

35
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,920
of your possibilities. And that's the whole point. The sense of control can only be exercised

36
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,640
in regard to a tactile. And then you can stop like thinking about probabilities and coefficients

37
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,120
and blood, blood, blood, blood, just to give you the sense of control in reality. Possibility

38
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,880
always remains a possibility, which means it can always be otherwise, which means your

39
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,440
control is useless there. But the problem is, you're so used to control that you always

40
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,280
see possibilities as secondary as optional. But actually, fundamentally, structurally speaking,

41
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:53,000
they come before the actual thing. So, possibilities, not being able to control them, yet depending

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,040
upon them, that's what the nature of Sankara is, exactly that very thing. If it termines

43
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,840
everything yet, you have no say in it. Well, whatever you can determine, whatever you

44
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,920
can determine, whether you can intend will be actual, which means there is always something

45
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,440
possible in relation to which means you can ever like, uproot it through your intention,

46
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,440
you can ever take it up and really own it. Because the act of owning is already determined

47
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,640
by the possibilities of ownership, which you're not yours and cannot be owned.

48
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,640
And understanding it, a feeling to get you out as a domain of yours.

49
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:46,040
Yeah. Because you still feel that your view or your relationship is completely changed

50
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,640
to it. Well, there, then you can't really say that you feel, anymore, you can just say

51
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:59,360
feeling is there. But it doesn't exist, it's my feeling, which is what existence is.

52
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:15,760
So, I try to imagine how it is, it might be like a death and then in a separation. I think

53
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,320
my self will be winter, because you're feeling self is cold.

54
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,080
Well, when you look from the point of view of self, it feels like death, because you can't

55
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:38,480
even comprehend how can something be without existing. So, yeah, as a protusion that you

56
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:59,240
have to die, protusion has to die. And back onto the craving. It's inseparable from the

57
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,240
feeling. So, you can't just examine craving as a phenomenon separator. You can see the

58
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,560
nature, you can distinguish, you can discern the nature, but it's simultaneously present

59
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:25,800
with the feeling. But in order to discern the nature, to start discerning, the particular

60
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,600
difference between different types of cravings. And I'm in psychological exam, exam, exam,

61
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,960
just mean in pleasure, you have to recognize the nature of craving in regard to the pleasure.

62
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,380
Now, just like theoretically, start pondering on what craving is. But to see it really in

63
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:53,600
regard to the present, the arisen pleasure, and same with pain, and same with neutral

64
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
feeling.

65
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:03,440
So, the problem is when there's a pleasant feeling, people would dismiss the entire thing,

66
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,520
throw the baby out with the bath water. So, degree of it is not a problem, it's just pleasant,

67
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:18,200
it's just agreeable. What else there is what you do, that's what you should subduing.

68
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:30,600
So, through feeling, you can recognize the craving with feeling craving, which is why

69
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:39,120
it's partly, but it's on part of the description. While feeling craving, to be more accurate.

70
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,320
Because again, we say with people is I think you're looking left and right.

71
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:51,960
You have to be serious of feeling pleasure. Well, no, you have to kind of reverse engineer.

72
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,080
You have to recognize the cure, okay, I'm a cotugina, therefore when I feel I crave,

73
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,720
you don't see any of it. But that's the first thought, that's the starting point. Because

74
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:15,600
I feel I crave. So, obviously now the first reaction may be, oh, I must not feel, but

75
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,480
that's not a problem. The problem is that you crave. So, how can you feel without craving?

76
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,920
If you find that out, you'll feel from craving, craving becomes redundant, because you can

77
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:41,480
feel feeling irregardless. Feeling irregardless. Feeling irregardless of craving. But not knowing

78
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:51,640
the craving is redundant, you crave. It's a pointless thing, it's a pointless endeavor.

79
00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:04,360
Yes, because no matter how much you crave for it or anything else, you'll never come

80
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,760
about there, what you crave. Well, yeah, it's that also. And also, it's just because,

81
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:20,320
yeah, the reason thing is indifferent to the flavor.

82
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,480
So a thing arises in ceases, whether you crave or not makes no difference. So your craving

83
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,440
is just like trying to interfere, but again, all your craving can ever accomplishes, again,

84
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,320
arising in ceasing, that is indifferent to your craving. So that's why our craving

85
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,360
can never be satisfied, yeah. But it can never even be, even the idea, the conception

86
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,920
of the idea of satisfaction is completely ignorant, because it just doesn't even pertain

87
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,880
to the same domain craving and feeling. It's not, if there were generally mixed, means

88
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,280
craving could affect the feeling, but it can't. It's just feeling nothing to do with craving.

89
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:10,960
So like the feeling is indifferent, it might even be to say too much, to make feelings,

90
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:19,320
it sounds like feeling does care in a little way, it's indifferent, but it's so, you know,

91
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,360
it's just saying something to everything different, it's almost saying too much, giving

92
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,960
it too much of a concern, even. It's so actually indifferent.

93
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,440
Yeah, I guess, depending on how you start designating terms, but when I say indifferent,

94
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,640
I mean, I mean, like, economists, and that's what the economy means. It doesn't mean

95
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:48,880
I acknowledge you, but I don't care about it. It means like, you just, it's impossible

96
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,960
to even acknowledge you, and then we let you, like, in unshakable economy it is. And

97
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,040
you recognize that aggregates cannot be acknowledged, nor can they acknowledge, because

98
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:07,200
they're actively self enclosed indifferent to each other. So just the idea of them relating

99
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,920
in any form can only arise from not knowing that they cannot relate in the first place.

100
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,800
That's how you assume the relation, that's what Upadana takes out the aggregates through

101
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,720
its own assumption, but they remain indifferent to it through and through for the whole duration.

102
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,120
They can never actually be accessed or affected. So creating is one of the unnecessary pressure

103
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:54,160
or jumping around. Yeah, unnecessary pressure, yeah, unnecessary lean, unnecessary kind of inclination.

104
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,000
And again, in the same sense, you can measure your craving because you're feeling you can

105
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:09,520
measure your suffering because of craving simultaneously presently inseparable. So if there

106
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,480
is pain present on account of something, it's not actually on account of that thing,

107
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:25,440
but it's an account of the craving that's present as it happens to be in regard to that thing.

108
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,880
So somebody says something that upsets you. You're not upset because what they said, what

109
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,400
they've done, whatever, what they've implied, but you're upset because in regard to that

110
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:44,520
experience as a whole, you are craving. Since it's unpleasant, you're craving it to know

111
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:51,800
not to be. So if you stop craving it to not be, the pain will disappear right there and

112
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:59,360
then that very moment, which is why often people get some relief through saying, are just

113
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,200
being the present moment or just accept things or just just open up and don't resist and

114
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:13,280
so on and so forth. But that's not enough. Like you can do that once, twice, 100 times.

115
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,520
You can do that whole life when you might have a more peaceful life, but that's not enough

116
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:25,400
to bring understanding. Because you know, every religion teaches that we're very often,

117
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,280
not every maybe, but quite often you hear that through various Guruji's or whatever else

118
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,520
or just be present, just not as is just accept acceptance and tell you, just love a Christian

119
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,880
love is a form of that kind of acceptance. You just love whatever comes your way and stuff.

120
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,680
But see, that is a rather like overriding, that's overshooting view. No, you should not

121
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,720
accept everything. You should accept only what you resist, but that which you don't resist,

122
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,160
you shouldn't be accepting further. So you can't apply the blanket acceptance because

123
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:08,720
there are different types of cravings. So craving is subtle than that. But then if you were

124
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,240
to understand fully correctly with the right view of craving is, then that would be the

125
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,920
end of it. You wouldn't have to do it because now you understood it and now it's gone.

126
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,520
But the only reason you have to each time accept things once they have a reason is because

127
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,320
there is no understanding in relation to their arising. So you still assume that they

128
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,440
can be craved, therefore you crave, therefore you override it through acceptance and you

129
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:43,680
let it diminish and then you feel dead. But it's like a psychological cycle almost.

130
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,120
The dharma should take you to the point and should be developed as such and say, wherever

131
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,880
you don't have to do anything in order to be free or in order to non-suffer. There was

132
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,680
always something that guided me. It always made sense. I had that even as a lab person

133
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,840
when I started. It was like, if it's a true piece, it's something that you don't have

134
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:08,360
to maintain. If it's a true freedom from suffering, it's something that doesn't require me

135
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,480
to keep doing it. Obviously, if you keep doing it until you reach it, but once it's fully

136
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,720
developed, you don't have to. So anything that was falling short of that cannot be the

137
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:24,000
ultimate truth. So if they say psychology or whatever, well, the pain arises or painful

138
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,400
memory sometimes, well, you should do this and then you should do that and you should

139
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,200
do this. And certainly, it helps in that linear psychological way. But the fact that you

140
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,280
have to do something in the first place, that's already a problem. But they people don't

141
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,000
see that usually. They just take that for granted and then deal with the problem. But the

142
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,560
problem is that you have to deal with the problem in the first place. That's already a big

143
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,520
problem. That's the biggest problem. That's what Dukar, this is, is. You are not it is

144
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,400
because you know that there might be something you will need to do. You will have to do in

145
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:09,200
order to be at ease. And that's making you uneasy. Yeah. So that's exactly the point

146
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,800
when it comes to craving. You know, I have to do this and then you gently soften or release.

147
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,440
It's just psychological battle that is revolving around the same view that it's failing to

148
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,880
see that the fact that you have to do anything in the first place is already a big issue.

149
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:33,000
It's the issue. All of this is circumstantial afterwards. But yeah, there is a degree of

150
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:42,120
truth in like, oh, when there is a resistance anger or accepting it, not resisting it

151
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:50,280
will cancel out the craving. But again, you can do that for the right reasons and you can

152
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,280
do that for the wrong reasons. If you don't know what the deal with the craving and the

153
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,320
feeling in there, if you have no concept of simultaneous dependence, but teachers and

154
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,520
Obama, you never see, you never do it for the right reasons, which is why somebody can

155
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,040
be quite evolved in that sense, but still be a protugina. He's still doing the whole

156
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,440
thing. Rightly, he's doing the banner for the wrong reasons. So his sense of why he's

157
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:27,840
still there. He's still there. He's still there. He's still there. He's still there.

158
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,440
Well, painful feeling is painful because you're resisting. So you know, okay, the first

159
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:40,440
I have to stop resisting it. But then you stop resisting it, the pain might disappear.

160
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,000
But you don't get fooled by that and then, okay, see, I fixed it, that's the fix. So each

161
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,320
time the pain arises, I'll stop resisting it. And then you develop this general view

162
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,080
that overrides everything. Sometimes it could respond to the nature of things, sometimes

163
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,000
it doesn't. The point is, if it doesn't even once, it means it's not the right view.

164
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,760
Right view is always the right view. So you should not be fooled by when you, yeah, you

165
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,640
just stop resisting it. You just resign to it. The pain is gone. Okay, this particular

166
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,760
pain is gone. Now, how will I reach a point where you want to rise in the first place?

167
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,680
And accepting, see, all of those psychological methods, the heat, you just accept it or

168
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,040
you do this or you do that. All that required thing to rise in the first place, which means

169
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,880
all that requires ignorance and craving in order to be able to deal with ignorance and

170
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:43,480
craving temporarily. So that's why it's not satisfactory for somebody who wants to be free.

171
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,720
And that's why it doesn't pertain to the nature of the four noble truths. Because four

172
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,080
noble truths are more than just, oh, you just accept or you just don't indulge. That's

173
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,680
anybody can do that and see the degree of worldly benefit in it. No, you have to have a direct

174
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,200
simultaneous insight into presence of craving, to the extent that craving is present, to

175
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:18,840
that extent suffering is present. Because the only reason accepting in regard to pain

176
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:29,720
works is because it cancels out the craving. But accepting it, oh no, I'm welcoming it,

177
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,680
that's actually already overdoing it. You don't need to go that far. But because you don't

178
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,680
know, you go that far and as it happens, going that far also passes the craving and cancels

179
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,280
it out. But then you keep walking much further than you have to. In other words, it happens

180
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,560
that accepting also cancels out the craving in regard to the unpleasant feeling. But if

181
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,440
you are to understand that the presence of craving means presence of suffering and you

182
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,880
just abandon craving, then you don't have to accept anything, nor refuse anything. Because

183
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:17,760
the attitude of accepting and refusing is aimed at the thing out there. You see what I mean?

184
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,040
Like the path that you cross, the distance that you cross in an act of accepting, something

185
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,640
that bothers you, happens to also walk past the degree of craving that is somewhere there.

186
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,440
But you have no idea what that craving is, so you just go the whole distance and then

187
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,440
the craving disappears, sometimes. Not always, obviously.

188
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,760
Because it really might have changed anything. Well, exactly. Or you might have been walking

189
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,880
in a different direction. You might have been thinking accepting the wrong thing and craving

190
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,880
applying to something different. So when you get it right, you get it for the wrong

191
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:04,080
reasons. In other words, you don't know why you got it right. But if you recognize it,

192
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,560
and then again, again, because of that, accepting people to develop this general plan can view,

193
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,840
so then they just accept everything. I love everyone. And then I pretend that people

194
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:21,320
are not bad. But if you were to see that actually, it's irrelevant. What happens to you?

195
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,040
It's irrelevant whether you accept it or not. What is relevant, whether you crave or not?

196
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:35,560
In other words, what I was saying before is, there can be craving, sorry, accepting and

197
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,800
craving, accepting or refusing implies craving. But there can be craving without accepting

198
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:53,120
or refusing. So you can't accept or refuse as a pathogen without craving. But you can

199
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,000
still crave without accepting or refusing. Because craving is more promoted than act of accepting

200
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,440
in regard to particular thing or refusing the particular thing. So you just know. So you

201
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,600
might do that initially, because your mind is not subtle enough. But the point is to take

202
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,800
you to the point whereby you recognize that the craving is problem, and that's what

203
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,920
a solution is. So abandoning craving then will prevent the problem from arising in the

204
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,800
first place. And then the act of accepting or refusing will not be active or accepting

205
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:34,200
or refusing through craving. It will just be agreeable, disagreeable. And also, by knowing

206
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,440
where the real problem of craving is, you won't have to pretend and try to cover everything

207
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,960
up and paint in your blanket view. Oh no, no, no, he is a good person. Oh no, he means

208
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,960
well, he means well, no. He acts like a foolish idiot, and it's a fact. But you're not upset

209
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:00,240
in a car that even if he's insulting you, because you don't crave. Or rather, a recognition

210
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,080
of someone's innocence, stupidity, aimed at you that is offending you, that offense won't

211
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:14,240
cause you suffering. You can recognize this is disagreeable, but you won't suffer on

212
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:24,480
that account, because you won't crave in regard to what is disagreeable. And you still

213
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,480
don't have to accept what he's saying. Why would you accept it when you know it's loads

214
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,240
of nonsense? Why would you have to pretend that he's good? So people do that because they

215
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:43,240
don't know what to do. Same where we spoke about the super, by not recognizing the super

216
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,760
nemitana, super nemitana, and dealing in the level of significance, people need to, they

217
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,040
overshoot the mark and they look at the decomposed bodies and stuff. That helps initially in

218
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:01,160
the same sense, accepting good health initially. But only so, that you can be able to recognize

219
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,680
it actually, the problem is way beyond this. The problem is that I'm moved in the first

220
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,120
place. So I don't want to have to go and run and look at the pictures of decomposed bodies

221
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,440
whenever I have lost the rising. But it's way too much last when I got careless. Then

222
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,520
it can help snap you back. But the point is no, the mind needs to be established in regard

223
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,840
to beautiful or ugly, as something that is ugly, as something is unwanted. And that's

224
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,920
where dispassion is reached. And then you can have all the beauty in front of you. The

225
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,840
mind is beyond it. The mind sees it as it is. But if you each time keep running back to

226
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,280
the pictures in a super, you have a nice little collection and it will work less and less.

227
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,600
And it's exactly this accepting attitude. I'll just just be present and accept whatever

228
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,080
comes your way. It can come as a revelation to somebody who's never present and never accepted

229
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,240
anything that comes his way. And then to accepting it, he does actually accidentally as well,

230
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,320
doesn't crave. But that's only initially, because he just took the whole box, but sooner or later

231
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,440
that will wear out. And then it will stop having that effect. Because then you start craving in

232
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:22,920
regard to that, craving doesn't stay always in front of you. So in the same sense as a subo,

233
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:30,520
it shoots the mind, if done improperly, accepting or refusing, or at a fused pleasure will mean

234
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,440
you deny all the pleasure. Pleasant feeling, you think the pleasant feeling is the problem,

235
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:43,480
you deny it, you think the painful feeling is the problem, you accept it. But neither painful,

236
00:26:43,480 --> 00:27:08,760
nor pleasant feeling, the neutral, are actually the problem. So you have no craving in regard to

237
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:15,800
what you feel. If the bad feeling arises on account of what somebody said, you can see it clearly.

238
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,360
Oh, what he said is right, I was actually wrong. So this agreeable feeling is the result of

239
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,120
something wrong that I've done. Like sometimes when other hands are reprimanded by the Buddha.

240
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,560
But because it won't be any craving, you won't take it personally, you can't, it's inconceivable.

241
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,200
So your behavior will just be modified according to it. Oh, this is right.

242
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,000
Or if they just criticize you, and there is a disagreeable feeling on account of the world you're

243
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,240
hearing, and you realize they have no idea what they talk about, they're the losing ignorant

244
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,960
angry person, you will not at all, you thank your brother, thank you, you're here, no, you know. And

245
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,880
that's a fact, and you don't want to be there, so you are the dismissed them, or leave yourself,

246
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,680
you don't have to deal with any of it. It's being crazy. Either way you won't crave, being

247
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:19,480
praised, pleasure, you won't be taken by. Sometimes praise is a fact, then you can confirm it,

248
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,600
as the Buddha did. Yes, I am the greatest, thank you. But sometimes the praise is for completely

249
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,280
the wrong reasons. And you won't be intoxicated by either of it.

250
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:50,120
You can find a black now, there's no intense, like I was, intense feelings, or I can't notice any intense.

251
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:56,040
No, there's an intro feeling, and there's the hardest one to recognize,

252
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:04,040
craving in the north and there, and as we spoke before, craving in our intellect,

253
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:11,400
like resting, feeling secure, feeling safe, feeling calm, feeling peaceful,

254
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:18,520
unless it's the piece of an era, and then it's not the piece.

255
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,160
So you should not relax, you can lay down and sleep, but in turn,

256
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,880
your mind should never relax, because it doesn't need to relax, that's the whole point.

257
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,000
Body needs to relax, body needs to sleep, the mind doesn't. It doesn't at all.

258
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,680
Now I'm really tired, I need to sit down. You sit down, but with your body sitting down,

259
00:29:52,680 --> 00:30:00,360
your mind sits down. But there isn't an excuse for that. That's what the Buddha meant when he said,

260
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,760
the consciousness should not rest and get established upon anything. Like a cow,

261
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,200
if it leans onto the wall, it's eaten by the insides, it leans on the ground,

262
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,040
it leans on the tree, it's eaten by whatever it leans on.

263
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,320
And that doesn't require effort, right? That doesn't require, you're like,

264
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:28,600
you know, clenching your teeth, I can't do it, not at all. You're just an attitude of mind

265
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,760
in regard to laying in your bed all day.

266
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:41,160
You just have to have that mind. That attitude requires mindfulness, which is why mindfulness

267
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,280
is always needed. You can have that too much. And mindfulness to the extent that

268
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:53,000
the consciousness is the biggest. Yeah, the existence, exactly. Mental drilling,

269
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,400
making that mental effort. It doesn't cover your body. Sometimes you have to get up,

270
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,000
keep walking, don't just go to sleep again, because often people give in to sleep as a form of

271
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,280
mind goes to sleep. If you go to sleep only when your body really leads to sleep, that's fine.

272
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,240
But if you go to sleep as a psychological result of, you know, you don't want to deal with stuff

273
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:23,800
for, the mind is resting. So I like to come back from work, open a can of beer, and you know,

274
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:31,000
watch my favorite TV program. I deserve it. I've been working eight hours a day, I need to rest.

275
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,880
That's obviously the coolest example. But you can, you know, leave an equity without a TV without

276
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:43,560
anything. And yeah, I've been meditating for 10 hours, and I'm going to go and sit down and

277
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:51,160
have a cup of tea and rest. Sure, do that. But that's still not an excuse for your mind to sit down

278
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:58,440
and rest. No, it's an excuse that when you're busy for your mind to go and get busy.

279
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:06,120
I think to see the distinction, this is my body, and we'll do what it has to do, what it needs to do.

280
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:14,040
And keep your mind alert in regard to it. That's what mindfulness is about the means basically.

281
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
This means you're like a robot touching means basically you're mindful in a way of whatever

282
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,520
your body is doing throughout the day and night. Action's intention and stuff, you're mindful

283
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,280
in regard to it. So you don't lay in it, you don't come into it, you don't become it.

284
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,720
Yeah, that was a good, a good night, some good days. You can't play it, can't play it. And then

285
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,880
when you're laying down. Yeah, you can give up. Stop pounding letting that. You'll be working all day.

286
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,720
I will continue. Well, whatever if the continues are not, that's fine. That's on its own.

287
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,080
But the only thing you should be concerned when you're okay, I've been making effort all day,

288
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,400
I can't do it anymore. That's fine. Go ahead and have a break. Physically and mentally,

289
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,360
so to speak, but don't allow your mind to rest in that rest.

290
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:22,680
Yeah, always keep an eye on it, because that doesn't require a terrible zero effort, because the

291
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,920
eye, the awareness, the degree of awareness is always there. Always you be dead. So that's why

292
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:35,640
mindfulness comes with understanding of what mindfulness is. The awareness is always there.

293
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:42,280
That's why awareness is always there. No, a degree of awareness is always there for as long as

294
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:51,320
you're alive. That's how it gets work. So it just means that whatever it's arising,

295
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,240
there is a degree of awareness in regard to it. Otherwise, that thing would not be manifested.

296
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,600
So you stop doing the awareness, I'm aware, I'm mindful. You just recognize it as coming,

297
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,520
being implied in the things. So the mind never forgets that, and in that way, you never lose

298
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,440
mindfulness even in the act of forgetting. You forget something particularly, you don't forget

299
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:29,640
the nature of forgetting. And that resting, that welcoming, is delighting. That's what the

300
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:35,320
life is here. That's always, it doesn't delight, it doesn't welcome. That's what I have to do.

301
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,040
You've been sleeping all day and wake up and you still feel a crap and you can't get up.

302
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:51,480
You're just physically wiped. So you go back to sleep. That's fine. As long as you don't welcome

303
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:58,360
it internally. Don't welcome anything internally. That doesn't mean you have to stop doing it externally.

304
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:08,840
So there is a distinction. So you don't welcome it. And through that non-welcoming,

305
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,480
if it was generally bodily tiredness, yeah, you'll sleep. But if it ain't, it would become apparent.

306
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,360
I don't know, I'm not actually sleeping anymore, which means it wasn't bodily. It was something my mind

307
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:27,400
wanted to do because there was no other distractions to keep me up engaged. So I just couldn't deal with

308
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:34,440
boredom. But then when you're bored, fine, we're bored. Don't do anything. Don't welcome that.

309
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:41,400
You can keep not doing anything. Never welcoming for a second, or you can keep doing it, but

310
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,160
oh, I want to let our want to go for a nice place and walk climb the waterfalls. It's fine. Don't

311
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,600
welcome it. Don't welcome it in the beginning. Don't welcome it at the end. Don't welcome it for

312
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:57,880
the only time in between. So the mind always remains alert in regard to it. And that's effortless.

313
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,280
Does it require any of it? In the beginning, obviously, it would feel like, you know,

314
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:12,280
I'm spoiling the party, but it's just because you're over-shooting the mark, initially, so you're all uptight.

315
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:39,000
Well, don't welcome that. It's a great one for being, when knowing being, it's just that. That's the feeling.

316
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:48,120
Well, yeah, craving for being, craving for non-being, craving for sensuality. Basically,

317
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,800
craving for sensuality is craving for being, or non-being through the senses. So it's even more

318
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:01,960
proliferated. For particular thing, craving for particularness of particular that means

319
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,480
sensual craving. Now you can stop craving in regard to particular object, particular objects of

320
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,280
your senses, and then you abandon the central craving. But then you still have the more subtle

321
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:20,200
craving for being and the absence of being, non-being, craving for A phenomenon to be or A phenomenon

322
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,280
to disappear. So it's still subtle kind of affinity and resistance.

323
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,120
Obviously, much subtler than actually fully developed craving for central objects, or

324
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,720
absence of them, if they are unpleasant. But it's still the same age, so that's why Anagami is

325
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:49,880
not free from those regards to craving. You can't love and hate, which pertains to the

326
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:59,560
infatuation or revulsion in regard to central objects. But you can still experience

327
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:07,560
craving in regard to phenomena and absence. It doesn't mean craving for the whole

328
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:15,880
he delights in the dharma. No, no, no. Badia was affected by that woman laughing at him.

329
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,640
Didn't hate her, because he was affected by it. He craving for non-being or that experience,

330
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,400
which is what sent him out, and made him realize.

331
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,040
And say, like when Anagami's don't lay Anagami, they don't become because

332
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:49,160
or be coonies and go forth, is when they still, well, they crave for the notion of the sense of

333
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,960
duty in regard to their family. No, that's the right thing, that's what I want to do.

334
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,080
So they stay to look after their parents, and that's why they don't become adults. But they're

335
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:28,520
bad to sexuality and everything. So I forgot, in the day, making craving myself, well, I mean,

336
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,200
there's back in the morning watching for that. Well, you can't see your craving directly.

337
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:40,280
It's not like, oh, there's Anagami, stop doing it. What you have to watch in the back of your mind

338
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:52,280
is whether you delight in acceptance or delight in aversion. That's what Anger offers a form of pleasure.

339
00:39:52,280 --> 00:40:02,840
He says on me, and you feel angry, and then you delight in telling them all for, or, you know,

340
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,360
revenge, payback, or ranting about them to somebody else's gige for relief.

341
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,840
Yeah, yeah, he's like a sifla guy, he's like a guy, you're delighting in that.

342
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:22,040
So in order to not crave, well, you can offer sure that there is a suffering present craving is there.

343
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,480
So how can you indirectly, directly do it? If you know what I mean, it's an

344
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,840
indirect action, but if it's fully known how it can be done, it can be done directly, in its indirect nature.

345
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:43,640
Yeah. Yeah. Watching the light. Well, you watch the light. That's something you do.

346
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:50,040
Oh, I'm welcoming it, therefore I will not welcome it. Through that welcome it, you cannot crave it.

347
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:57,480
Through that craving, the suffering won't be there. But then you also need to recognize that,

348
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,880
because the degree of this pleasure will still be there, but that's not what suffering is.

349
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:11,080
So that's why the understanding is like the core of the whole thing and the reason for liberation.

350
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:20,120
Somebody can do this, but without understanding, without being able to discern what he's told to

351
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:28,200
discern, I discern the pain, I reason on its own, from the suffering. Unless you discern that,

352
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,800
it is the same thing, basically like two sheets of glass identical, unless you know that they're two,

353
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:40,760
you won't know that they're two, because it's just one thing. And there is no difference between the two,

354
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,560
but except that they're two, and that's the difference.

355
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:57,000
Too much suffering in pain. Yeah. Physical pain. Well, like see that when you say physical pain,

356
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,680
people usually associate a bodily sensation, or that's unpleasant. No, that's not physical pain.

357
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,960
Hearing somebody shouting abuse of you is a physical pain, because it came through your physical

358
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:18,600
ears. Seeing a disgusting image is a physical pain. Or it's pain or isn't regard to what,

359
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:29,880
yeah, having a lunch chopped off is also physical pain. Now mental pain isn't regard to any of that

360
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:48,360
type of pain. When your mind is affected by it as well. Well, there is a feeling of am I bothered

361
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:56,280
on account of feeling unpleasant? Do I feel an urge to deal with it? Means, oh, I'm craving.

362
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,160
There is a craving present, and that's the reason why I suffer. And that's the problem. Not

363
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,080
the unpleasant feeling, it has a reason. That's why when it says, it's like he develops three, four

364
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:13,880
knowledge and becomes an art hand, and he recognizes any disturbance that is left with me now,

365
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,160
will be disturbance in a kind of this far sense, or on kind of this body. And that's often said,

366
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:27,000
oh, just endure unpleasant words and abuse or ever done. Just endure it brown when you're done.

367
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
He said that, why would the woman need to say that to Uncle Himal? I mean, he was already in

368
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,960
our hand. That's what you would think, wouldn't you? No, you're just reminding him,

369
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,280
because there is, there would be still this pleasure, but none of it can ever even

370
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:49,960
be remotely conceived, pain like suffering, which is what pain is. This agreeable feeling is not

371
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,200
pain. Not wanting this agreeable feeling, that's what pain is.

372
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:04,360
Yes, you could overshoot, let's say, by feeling a cramp in your leg, me, it's not too twisted.

373
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,840
Yeah, I'll endure it, I'll endure it, okay. That's already misplacing, you're thinking it's

374
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:19,560
out there, so do you know? What you should do then, you should move, and then recognize the pain

375
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,840
of the guilt, then arises an account that you couldn't hold up your determination to not move.

376
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,520
That's what suffering is more likely to be found, than enduring in your twisted joint,

377
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,440
and then turning yourself into an invalid, because you're such a keen meditator.

378
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,040
The anxiety, the hollow feeling that arises on the fact that you could not hold up

379
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,480
the determination that has a reason I will not move, I moved. Oh, what is that showing?

380
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,640
You were not in control. That's very unpleasant, that's what suffering is.

381
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:03,800
So let that arise, don't bother torturing your body, and twisting your knees, and

382
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,120
pushing the nails through your skin, or whatever else they do.

383
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:16,360
No, let the guilt, let the anxiety, let those painful mental feelings arise, because they all

384
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,320
have in common suffering, there's no doubt about them. You can suffer in regard to the body,

385
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,960
what you heard, but when it comes to this type of suffering, that is always suffering,

386
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,320
which is why those things cannot arise in the naran. This agreeable feeling can arise on the

387
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,840
account of somebody shouting abuse at him. A agreeable feeling might arise on the account of

388
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:44,040
somebody praising him. None of those things will induce lust or aversion anymore ever again,

389
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:51,640
and certainly he'll never have experienced anxiety, guilt, doubt, and all those mental painful

390
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:57,080
feelings. So there is that difference between mental and bodily, basically just means

391
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:04,120
on what account has in a reason, but every feeling is a mental feeling. You don't feel feelings in

392
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:09,720
your body. Oh, I feel something in my back, no, you perceive something in the back, you feel in

393
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:16,200
regard to your whole body, or particular aspect of your body. Oh, I'm about to lose my hand.

394
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,640
I feel very scared now, and I'm very, very afraid.

395
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,400
And that's what hurts, not the perception of whatever is happening in your hand.

396
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:43,320
And when I get in that, I couldn't feel any physical pain, but it's painful.

397
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:54,840
Yeah, you've got that. The body is, you know, pressure, you just keep moving here and there.

398
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:02,520
You know, it's leaning back, so you know, it's scratching, and that's annoying. That's the problem.

399
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,720
So I try not to scratch or just try.

400
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:17,480
So you might initially not want to scratch, just because, oh, you're not sure where to look for the craving,

401
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,320
or where the problem is. Where the problem is not the need, the problem is not the

402
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:33,160
arising of ditch and the scratch. The problem is whether you imply cravings for doing it,

403
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:40,360
whether action constantly implies craving, in which case it's an action, it's a karma.

404
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,000
You remove craving from action, then karma ceases to become, then it just

405
00:47:45,000 --> 00:48:04,600
responds to things, significance, intentions, that's it. You have to be careful in doing things like

406
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,040
you should put up with it, and you think you can't stop there.

407
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,760
But you haven't, does that mean if you can't be on it?

408
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,040
On the server, you know, because something else comes from it. No, that's why, like, in the

409
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:24,520
service, some, some, some monks, you know, needed ascetic practices, because they would be making them

410
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:30,760
genuinely look at the right direction, in the right way. Some didn't. Some actually was completely

411
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,680
counterproductive. Through ascetic practices, for them, they were overshooting them up, and they

412
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:51,000
could not see it. Which is why applying the blanket, we should all be doing this, we should all be

413
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:09,000
doing as ridiculous. I mean, big to happen, or do something really dramatic, to see, okay, I understand, create, I suppose,

414
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,720
naturally things will happen, and are quite dramatic, so it's quite intense, we use them, or whatever.

415
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,640
Or even if that doesn't happen, the faith that it can happen, if you dwell on it, they will become

416
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,720
dramatic in itself. But that's how people lose their minds. They don't lose their minds when

417
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:34,760
painful things happen to them directly. They lose their minds when they start gradually,

418
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:42,120
when they get eroded, by the recognition of the possibility that they are completely exposed,

419
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,440
and again in time, and again in a second, absolutely anything. It freaks you out.

420
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,240
When something bad happens, it's right in front of you, it's painful, or whatever, but it happened.

421
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:58,760
But the red is substitution. Yeah, exactly, anticipation. Which is what it's meant in the soot

422
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:07,320
as being prey to suffering. So you don't actually suffer, or you don't have to suffer, but you recognize

423
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:14,440
that you are prey to suffering, like descending upon you, so to speak, for whatever reasons.

424
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,120
You imagine, how would you feel if you were a prey? There isn't a problem in front of you,

425
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:28,360
but you just feel like at any time, something can pass on you, and hunt you down, and get you like that.

426
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,960
So even if nothing does, the fact that this, that's what brings you, makes you mad.

427
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:41,560
The anticipation in the war, like when people are in war, that's when you know, they go gray,

428
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:52,440
and lose their, you know, age 50 years overnight, because they're weight of my diet.

429
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,720
It's much easier when the fight breaks, start, oh, it's right there in front, so you just

430
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:06,440
fight or not, but it's the anticipation of the fight. Let's say it's the same age, anticipation

431
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:14,440
of the suffering. He feels his prey to suffering. That's the scary, not the fact that you suffer.

432
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,560
Well, that's also painful, but the fact that you can't suffer again, and again, and again, and again,

433
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:29,240
and you will. So if there is, imagine, if there is, if you are a prey,

434
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,400
to something, if something is hunting you, constantly.

435
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,480
You always just think that the results will come when actually, well, it's there as well.

436
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,480
I do, I do try to bring it up there. Well, you have to come to brain death.

437
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,480
The possibility of the timing. Exactly.

438
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,960
Because you might try to bring it up in particular things, and might bring it up to an extent,

439
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:02,200
in regard to particular things, but you kind of leave yourself out of it through that,

440
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,880
that sort of incomplete contemplation. But if you start thinking about the fact that you die,

441
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:19,640
stop reading, drown. It's risky because it can really freak you out, but yeah, it does hammer it

442
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:32,920
back home. If you fear death, there is a feeling in regard to something like there is something

443
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:39,000
you are still holding, and to that degree you are alive. That gives you the, well,

444
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:48,520
it comes home. Motivation and it's sort of like delineates, delineates, that's what delineates, outlines

445
00:52:48,520 --> 00:53:01,080
the problem, it reminds you of where the problem is. And that's, you know, that's what dumb is,

446
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:10,760
that's what dumb is. And you deal with that problem, you overcome death, fear of death, no particular

447
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,440
problem arising on the account of particular instance, you know, we can never bother you.

448
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:27,240
He's just going to be disagreeable with you, aren't they? Yeah, you left it all.

449
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,680
Because it kind of plays my dying, you know, I get pretty much like, and then I can process

450
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:47,880
all the same, you know, I sort of imagine it. Well, again, if you imagine it linearly in a process,

451
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:54,840
then it's not really a calica. Obviously, it can always be a calica, in a sense that any

452
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:00,280
linear process is present as such, as an elicent thing, and mindful of death means ah,

453
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:07,000
right there right now, so that is a calica. So no matter what stage of your linear contemplation

454
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,600
of death, you recognize, I will die. That's simultaneous.

455
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,040
Because you're not doing the contemplation so to actually die,

456
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:33,080
but doing the contemplation to allow that fear of death to arise,

457
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:38,280
and see on what level of your eyes is, and this is what needs to be dealt.

458
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,440
Because even that fear, if it's unpleasant, it's not a pleasant because of the dying,

459
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,600
and because of the fear, it's a pleasant because you crave, and you go, you so don't want it.

460
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:55,640
So you remove that, not wanting it. You don't welcome the unwanting.

461
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:05,640
And then you won't be afraid of death either. The only thing you would be, he's very

462
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:12,920
mindful, if the death comes. Or just the thought that will immediately bring the mindful,

463
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,600
because that's where mindfulness comes from, which is why, like Sartre Pan has been

464
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:28,680
managing throughout life, the moment of that, he will realize the fruit, because that's where the fruit is.

465
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:36,760
But I try to get just death, you know, because I know, but I do know that

466
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,320
is a possibility. I leave the situation, I get caught up in other situations,

467
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:46,840
and I go out, sit here, whatever that I caught up is interesting. I can't look at caught up.

468
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:55,080
I pick up a fire and I can feel a pool, or whatever that. So some of that I don't see with craving,

469
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:02,840
but I see the craving for criticism. Well, that's why you have to have that wisdom to recognise

470
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:10,440
off. The problem is still there. So whether I'm now using this environment to avoid the recognition,

471
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,560
and remind us that the problem is still there, or whether I'm using it to really practice.

472
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:22,200
And again, it's like how you eat your food, and why you eat your food. But you allow it to become

473
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:36,040
because it's natural, or where you keep in mind the real reasons.
