1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,520
I'm going to discuss the right attention, you only saw Manisikara, the Buddha praises

2
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:35,800
this quality many, many times. It's essential in the practice. Yeah, it's one of the prerequisites

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,120
for the right view as well, one out of two. And he says, because I do not see even a single

4
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:51,200
thing that so causes unarisen wholesome qualities to arise and unholesome qualities to decline

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,800
as right attention for one who attends carefully, unarisen wholesome qualities arise and

6
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,880
arisen unholesome qualities. He says, one who attends properly. So, one who attends

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,920
not careful, because people who think all they need to do is be careful and they'll

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,680
see the truth. Now, you actually need to know where you're supposed to attend, thus

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:24,320
attend properly. Rightly. Rightly, exactly. Attendly, rightly. And there are these two conditions

10
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,880
for arising of right view, the utterance of another and proper attention. These are the

11
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:47,400
two conditions. And we need to use these speaks about the pathages, depends on origination.

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:55,480
He uses that proper attention, explained it to that. Now, I'll just give one example.

13
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:09,120
This can be found in the connected discourses, some Utanika. Because before my enlightenment,

14
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,880
while I was still a Bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me. Alas,

15
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,960
this world has fallen into trouble in that it is born, ages and dies. It passes away

16
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,960
and is reborn. Yet it does not understand the escape from the suffering, headed by aging

17
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:36,680
in death. When now, will an escape be discerned from the suffering, headed by aging in death?

18
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,000
Then because it occurred to me, when what exists, does aging in death come to be? By what

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,280
is aging in death, determined? Then because, to proper attention, they took place in me

20
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,720
a breakthrough by wisdom. When there is birth, aging in death comes to be. Aging in death

21
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,120
has birth as its determination. So, through proper attention, it took place in me a breakthrough

22
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:20,040
by wisdom. So, as pretty much every other sutra, people can either read it, kind of

23
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:27,520
superficially, so to speak, and then read that passage as, okay, so he, the Buddha properly,

24
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,600
you know, he was careful attending, he was really thinking about it, and then he figured

25
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,520
it out. Because, yeah, it can read like that. But if you actually take every sutra to be

26
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,360
a phenomenological description of the nature of experience, nature of things, thus, if

27
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:51,880
I understood, a person would be at least a sotapana, if not more. Well, in that case, you

28
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,280
would approach that quite differently. So, if he says, so if he was the Yonisamanaseka

29
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,720
there, which he did, if he used the same term, that proper attention or the right attention

30
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:12,240
means, proper attention is that, which reveals the timeless principle of the teaching father.

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:22,320
And it reveals the principle of dependent origination, the principle, that basically has its two

32
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:30,600
factors that are simultaneously present, because it says, with what as condition has this,

33
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,240
well, with what as condition is aging in death being manifest. Because, you know, you

34
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:48,320
are aging and dying simply by being alive. So, what is the simultaneously present condition

35
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,040
for that state? It's the fact that you are manifested in this human existence. That's

36
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:01,640
what birth is. Birth is not coming out of womb. Birth is manifesting. Manifestation of

37
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,760
the father aggregates the ure appropriating. And that starts when the Buddha, the Buddha

38
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,680
said himself, that starts when an embryo is conceived. It's already, one is already manifested

39
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,240
into this human realm. So, what we take to be birth coming out of womb in a hospital

40
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:27,160
is just like one of the stages, one of the aspects of that manifestation. But there wouldn't

41
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,240
be coming out of womb if there was no embryo conceived in the first place. So, the birth

42
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,240
takes place when the five aggregates manifest, when the five aggregates a bound, sorry, when

43
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,040
the one to be bound is present and mother and father come together and mother is in season.

44
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,000
And then embryo is conceived. Embryo, there is the five aggregates. And that's what birth

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,120
is. And that embryo, when it's conceived simultaneously with its conception or rather

46
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,200
simultaneously with its manifestation, another thing that manifests simultaneously to that

47
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:12,760
is aging in death. Because growing of the embryo, it's already aging. It's already dying

48
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:22,960
because it's manifested. So, it's a simultaneous presence of manifestation aging in death. So,

49
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:34,200
that is the important thing to understand. With dependent origination, it's not the explanation

50
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:45,400
of causality because every dependent origination description starts with this, this is. So,

51
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,240
with two aspects, one, the determine is the other, but both are present. Simultaneous

52
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,280
is the present. That's what means it doesn't involve time. It's a carlica. It's timeless.

53
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,120
It doesn't involve time. Things that don't involve time are the ones that, like, in their

54
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:12,800
relationship, are the ones that are simultaneously present to the same extent. And that's what

55
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:21,720
proper attention shows you. With this, this is. So, that's why, if somebody has a right

56
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,720
view, all they need to do is practice proper attention because all they need to do is just

57
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,960
bring back to the mind that Simultaneous Principle of dependent origination. And they will bring

58
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:47,520
all the lust to fade. All aversion to fade. All ignorance to fade. Because there's whatever

59
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,960
he attends to. And he attends rightly when they fall. Yeah, whatever he attends to, he

60
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,840
attends rightly. He attends properly. He attends according to its nature. And that nature

61
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:12,240
is, it is determined. It is impermanent. With this, this is. I'll read the, my, my, my

62
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:30,640
Jimmy Kaya. Number two, all the tanks. Because this goes into using proper attention. Sure.

63
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,640
So this is the Sabah. Sabah, Sabah, Sabah, Sutta, all the tanks. Because I shall teach

64
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,400
you a discourse on the restraint of all the tanks. Listen and take closely to what I

65
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,720
shall. Say, yes, venable servant, because you play it. The best of unsaid this. Because

66
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,680
I say that the destruction of the tanks is for one who knows and sees. Not for one who

67
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,680
does not know and see. Means it's first, at least sort of one for this. Who knows and

68
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:07,040
sees what? Proper attention and unproperate attention. Exactly. The one attends properly.

69
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:16,080
Unarisen tanks, one one attends unproperly, improperly, improperly. Unarisen tanks arise

70
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,500
and arisen tanks increase. When one attends properly, unarisen tanks do not arise and arisen

71
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:40,200
tanks are abandoned. The tanks are three central, central desire being in English. Because

72
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,280
there are tanks that should be abandoned by seeing. There are tanks that should be abandoned

73
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:58,580
by restraining, by using, by enduring, by avoiding, by removing and by developing. So

74
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:06,820
it goes into each of those. Tains to be abandoned by seeing. What tanks should be abandoned

75
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,420
by seeing? Here because an untought ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and

76
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,340
is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dharma, who has no regard for true man and is unskilled

77
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,180
and undisciplined in their Dharma, does not understand what things are fit for attention

78
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,020
and what things are unfit for attention. Since that is so, he attends to those things

79
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:35,100
unfit for attention and he does not attend to those things fit for attention. What other

80
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,500
things unfit for attention that he attends to, they are things such that when he attends

81
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:47,420
there, the unarisened taint of central desire arises, the taint of being arises and the taint

82
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:57,620
of ignorance arises. These are the things unfit for attention that he attends to. And

83
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:11,220
the opposite, when he knows what he is doing, but the untought ordinary person also attends

84
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,300
in this improper way. He thinks himself, was I in the past? Was I not in the past? Was

85
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:26,860
I in the past? How was I in the past? See, that is the crucial difference. Improper

86
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:39,380
attention is the attention that carries the sense of self, carries the notion of I in.

87
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:47,940
Proper attention is the attention that leaves no room for the sense of self. If you properly

88
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,980
attend, if you say, with this, this is, there is no room for the owner of either this

89
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:00,060
or this, or this or that, or in between the two. There is just no room for it. It is with

90
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,780
the rising of this, this also arises. Or rather with this, when this is present, this is

91
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:15,660
present too. So basically, fundamentally, you can take your experience as a whole and

92
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:25,620
you can see that it is utterly, completely determined by the presence of life. You can

93
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:33,300
say that. You are alive, thus, whatever you experience is because you are still alive.

94
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:41,940
Whatever you are experiencing, no matter how it differs particularly, the nature of experience

95
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,860
is there because life is still present. So you can, you can then just reflect further and

96
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,900
see, okay, well, are you in control of that life? Are you in control of the beating heart?

97
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,340
Are you in control of functional brain? Are you in control of preventing accidents

98
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:05,900
from happening? You are not. Thus, this life that is present rests upon the foundations

99
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,940
that are utterly inconceivable, inaccessible to you. And when you fully understand that,

100
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,700
then you cannot possibly regard it as yours. So that is what proper attention penetrates.

101
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:25,180
It descends that there are foundations that undermine you that you cannot access. So basically,

102
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:32,220
it restores the right order of things. Whereby, with this, this is. That is the right order.

103
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:40,900
For protrusion, it is with me, my experience is. I am thus things are for me, things are mine.

104
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:49,180
It is actually other way around. So that is exactly why it says, like somebody who is a

105
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:57,100
protrusion, an uninstructed world, who doesn't know how to attend to things properly. That

106
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,980
is why he ends up wandering these things. Because in the past, was I not? Was I not?

107
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,780
Will I be in the future? How I will be. How I will be. All of that revolves around the fact

108
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:17,340
that he completely taken for granted that he is. So now, now he is just wondering, how

109
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:23,540
easy was he all the time? But he never questions that, hold on, even the question of, what

110
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,540
am I, who am I, when I was, how I was? That all revolves around the present notion of

111
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:35,100
control. Which means he is not properly attending to the nature of experience, and he doesn't

112
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,620
see it as impermanent. And seeing it as impermanent means seeing it as not in your control.

113
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:51,260
I mean, have doubts arising? Yes, of course. Because basically, he makes himself viable to

114
00:14:51,260 --> 00:15:01,340
add doubt. He doesn't recognize that any of those questions, no matter what the particular

115
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,060
thing that they might be asking is, all those questions in the nature revolve around the

116
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,900
notion of sense of self. And that's all the mistake. Thus he'll then just doubt, because

117
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,780
none of the answers can be satisfied. Was I, yes it was, yes, but was I always? Well, I

118
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:23,140
don't know. Will I be? Well, I don't know that either. Am I now? Am I not now? How am I

119
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:30,300
now? All those, oh, it's just just permutations of the same assumption. But he goes beyond

120
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:39,420
doubt. He attends rightly. He goes beyond doubt if he basically, well, if he's basically

121
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:46,900
not concerned with those questions, because they're rooted in a mistake in assumptions.

122
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,860
So if he attends rightly, he addresses the mistaken assumptions of sense of control, permanence

123
00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:01,020
and I am. By dissolving that, everything that was depending upon it, namely those questions,

124
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:09,460
cannot remain. So he doesn't answer the questions. So the one who basically makes them cease. He's

125
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:19,140
understanding makes all the questions cease. He goes beyond doubt. This is, after that, a

126
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,820
well-thought, noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones and he's skilled and disciplined

127
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,820
in their dhamma, who has regard for true men and he's skilled and disciplined in their dhamma,

128
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,300
understands what things are for attention and what things are unfit for attention. Since

129
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,900
that is so, he does not attend to think those things unfit for attention and he attends

130
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:48,700
those things unfit for attention. And this is the way he attends. This is suffering. He

131
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,500
attends properly. This is the origin of suffering. He attends properly. This is the cessation

132
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:01,060
of suffering. This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering. When he attends properly

133
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:08,140
in this way, three fetters are abandoning him. The personality of you, doubt, and adherence

134
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:15,300
to rules and observances. These are called the tains that she would abandon thusly. This

135
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:21,900
is interesting because he's saying he's a noble disciple who attends in this way properly,

136
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:29,100
the four noble truths, but then when he does this, he reaches the fruit of sort of life.

137
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:36,300
Yeah, because in that other sort that there is a distinction before a person becomes

138
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,700
sort upon, he gets a pain to the right view. So, Dhammanusari, Sadhanusari. So, he's

139
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,620
not sort upon a yet, but his view is basically now along the right lines, which means he knows

140
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:54,540
what the proper attention is. So, as that very passage says, when he practices it, he comes

141
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,100
to understand this suffering, this is the origin, this is the cessation, this is the way

142
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,060
that he's got. But those are four things, so four noble truths, but they're basically

143
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:15,700
all revolving around the same insight, insight into freedom from suffering. So, fully understanding

144
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:23,300
all the aspects of that can be put into four noble truths. You understand what it is. You

145
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:30,340
understand what it makes you be. You understand what it makes you not be. And then you understand

146
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:45,140
the way that leads out of it. And again, you can connect that to what we just said before.

147
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:51,380
Appropriating your own life, your own body, your own experience, regarding it is yours.

148
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:58,220
That makes you liable to suffering. Even if you don't necessarily suffer on the immediate

149
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,660
level, like even if there is nothing unpleasant bothering you, the fact that you are appropriate

150
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,820
to these things means there is always a looming possibility of suffering, and that in

151
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:17,380
itself is suffering. And that's what he recognizes. This is suffering. So, since

152
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:27,940
itself, I am cannot stand on its own. It always needs, and actually, it's founded upon

153
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,100
a foundation, a relationship. It's founded upon a relationship with the world. And that

154
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:43,460
relationship is for me, mine. But when you recognize them, that your sense of self depends

155
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,100
upon the world. And when I say the world, I mean experience as a whole. I mean, your

156
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,100
sights, your sounds, melt taste touches, things that you are experiencing. That's what your

157
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,780
sense of self depends on. So, if you then start reflecting and seeing, attending to properly,

158
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:06,860
seeing the these things that you see here, taste touch are fundamentally out of your control.

159
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:16,740
You might access this degree of the volition once a thing has arisen. But even that volition

160
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:24,980
is within much greater image of non-control. Why? Because as I said, your heart can stop

161
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:35,220
any second. And you can't even conceive having a say in that. And yet your whole life,

162
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,100
all the things you experienced, all the things that you will experience, all the things

163
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,500
you are experiencing right now, depends upon that beating muscle in your chest, that pumps

164
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,780
blood. That's it. It's as random as this stream around us, that kind of runs over these

165
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:56,820
rocks and moves the leaves and branches or whatever. It's as movement. But you can also

166
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,860
see as a memory, you can't remember that putting your heart together, putting your body

167
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:09,980
together, and then becoming that body over, you know, as you just had it. Yeah, it was

168
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,900
just given to you. It's just given to you. It's just given to you. So you're not saying

169
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,980
it's assembly, you're not saying it's operating and you certainly have no say in it's ending.

170
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,980
Yet you regard it as yours. I mean, that is the discrepancy at the most fundamental

171
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:31,340
existential level. You undo that discrepancy means you're attending things properly. That

172
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:39,700
means your attention does not maintain that mistake. It does not maintain that discrepancy,

173
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,220
which is a wrong attention. And that's attention of everybody. That pathogena attends, and

174
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:54,100
every attention maintains that wrong order. Me first, my experience second. It means

175
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:01,100
being such a relative. Exactly. Those are the result of that discrepancy that the pathogen

176
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:09,420
is maintaining. So by seeing that you can't even own these things even if you want to,

177
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:15,820
no matter how hard you want to, you recognize, oh, thinking that I own them, or rather entertaining

178
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:25,060
the notions of ownership. Well, that's what suffering is. So then you recognize this is

179
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:31,620
suffering. The arising of suffering is this very notion of ownership in regard to things

180
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:38,900
that cannot be owned. And then consequently, the cessation of suffering is not the cessation

181
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:45,300
of things that cannot be owned. You know, the Buddha did not have to kill himself in order

182
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,500
to understand the nature of life. No, while you are alive, you understand the cessation

183
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,060
of life. The cessation of life is cessation of appropriation of life. So he understands

184
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:02,900
that cessation of suffering is removing of appropriation in regard to your life, your

185
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:09,940
existence, you don't own it, removing the ownership, disowning it, not entertaining it.

186
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,940
And then how you fulfill that, that's the phonoboture. Oh, this is the path that leads to

187
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,940
this fulfillment, to this cessation of suffering. And then it's basically the everything that

188
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:27,220
revolves around right view and right attention and right mindfulness. Which means that through

189
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,220
right view, right attention and right mindfulness, constant practice, it will eventually saturate

190
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,020
your whole life regardless of the circumstances, regardless of the feelings that have a reason,

191
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:46,500
regardless of the pleasant unpleasant agreeable, disagreeable perception, regardless of everything,

192
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,700
right view, right intention, right mindfulness, been brought to fulfillment, there will not

193
00:23:50,700 --> 00:24:02,660
be any kind of rekindling, so to speak, of the wrong order of that mistaken notion of ownership,

194
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:08,180
of that habit, basically, of ownership of that discrepancy. And that's when noble

195
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,180
belief of path has been practiced with fulfillment. So there are no traces of that discrepancy

196
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:19,860
left of those wrong notions left in any regard, in regard in regard to any sense or any thought

197
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,940
or any memory or any future plan. It's all saturated with the right attention, with

198
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,340
the right mindfulness, with the right view. They then obviously, it's right effort, right

199
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:39,740
reliability and so on. Right concentration. Right composure. Right composure, that's a

200
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:49,980
better translation, yeah. He doesn't say about the taints to be abandoned by the straining.

201
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:57,860
Here, bigger reflecting wisely abides with the eye of faculty restrained, while taints

202
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,220
dexation fever might arise in one who abides with the eye of faculty under strain, there

203
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:11,020
are no taints, a fexational fever in one who abides with the eye of faculty restrained.

204
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:19,020
And so, likewise, with all the other senses. It's quite simple. Well, exactly, yeah, straight

205
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,460
forward, yeah. Well, once the right view is established, that won't work. Well, none

206
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,980
of that will work for somebody who doesn't have the right view as the suit opens up, yeah.

207
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,940
It's the one for the one who sees, one who knows and one who sees. So once the right view

208
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,500
has established, then the one with the right view reckons is, okay, now it's about guarding

209
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,220
the senses, practicing the restraint. So none of the mistaken notions, the habits of

210
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,300
mistaken notions and discrepancies that are spread or maintained through last a version

211
00:25:53,300 --> 00:26:00,020
of delusion, none of those will be arising to practicing the restraint. You stick to

212
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,980
there long enough, and then they just, it becomes been possible for them to arise. It's

213
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,940
like, like, basically having a habit and then kind of getting rid of the habit. You have

214
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,580
to stick to the opposite behavior or to the restraint of the habit for a certain amount

215
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:27,860
of time, depending on how strong those habits were. So once you stick to it and practice

216
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:35,180
restraint and so on, and those habits stop arising, that's it. And then the noble disciple

217
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:44,940
there's the right proper attention. It tends to be abandoned by using a bigger reflecting

218
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:52,220
of what properly uses the robe only for protection from cold, from protection from heat, from contact

219
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,700
with flies, mosquitoes, wind, and the sun, and creeping things, and only for the purpose

220
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:06,300
of concealing the private parts. Reflecting properly, he uses alms food, neither for amusement,

221
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:12,140
nor for intoxication, nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only

222
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:18,660
for the endurance and continuance of this body, for ending this comfort and for assisting

223
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,980
of the holy life. Considering thus, I shall terminate old feelings without erasing new

224
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:31,620
feelings, and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort. What do you mean

225
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:41,700
by not erasing new feelings? Well, like the feeling of hunger, eating too much.

226
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,100
Yes, so you eat until the old feeling disappears, or hunger, but you don't overeat, so then

227
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:54,180
you have a new feeling of discomfort of being overeat, overeat. So he uses the resting

228
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,820
places, dwellings, only for protection from cold, from protection from heat, for protection

229
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,300
from contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, and the sun, and creeping things, and only

230
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:13,300
for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and for enjoying retreat. Reflecting

231
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:20,500
properly, he uses the medicinal requisites, only for protection from erasing, afflicting

232
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:27,060
feelings, and for the benefits of good health. While taints, vexation and fever might arise

233
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,820
in one who does not use the requisite task, there are no taints, vexation of feeling

234
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:39,020
like he uses them, thus these are called the taints that should be abandoned by using.

235
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:46,220
Because in most of the time, in monasteries, that's what you try to do, you try to use

236
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:56,820
those requisites as a monk, like that. That's before you have proper attention.

237
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:06,220
I mean, it's something to aspire, sure, but obviously, if you want that to result in the

238
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:12,540
abandoning of the taints, the right view is necessary, the right view comes first, it

239
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,140
will be said that many times, it needs to come first. If you don't know what you're supposed

240
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:24,220
to do, how can you do it? That's as simple as that. If you don't know what a dama is, how

241
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:36,020
can you practice it? There's the taints to be abandoned by enduring. Here are a big collecting

242
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,980
property, bears, cold and heat, hunger and thirst, and contact with flies, mosquitoes,

243
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:48,460
wind and sun, creeping things. He endures, ill-spoken, unwelcome words, and arisen bodily

244
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:56,360
feelings that are painful, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, distressing and menacing to life.

245
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,220
While taints, a vexation of evil might arise in one who does not endure such things, there

246
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:11,740
are no taints, vexation or feelings in one who endures them. So how does he endures the

247
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:22,500
weather, uncomfortable feelings, painful experiences? By becoming, a lot of people can endure

248
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:29,660
these things. Again, he will not, yeah, exactly, but he will not result in destruction of

249
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,420
lust, aversion and delusion if there is no right view. With the right view and with the

250
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:43,260
hardship, anything that was dependent, any of those habits, any of those discrepancies,

251
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:50,620
they were kind of hiding about, dependent upon cherishing the notions of comfort, for

252
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,740
example, will be destroyed with the right view that puts one through discomfort. So this

253
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:03,300
comfort founded upon the right view will destroy any of the taints. It doesn't mean that

254
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:12,540
the taints wouldn't be there, but in case they were, they would be destroyed. That's

255
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:22,020
why the Buddha sometimes, like for some monks, with the right view, ascetic practice,

256
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:30,260
do tangas, would be resulting in our hardship in developing further wisdom. For some other

257
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:37,660
monks, with the right view, it wouldn't. So he said, let those who want to exert themselves

258
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:43,020
in such practices, exert themselves at practices. But again, either way, the right view needs

259
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,460
to be there. So because, you know, people, people's habits have evolved differently. People's

260
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:55,100
lust have proliferated differently. Obviously, the existential discrepancies are the same,

261
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,780
but the particular manifestations of it, yeah, there needs to be addressed. So it's basically

262
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:06,700
like, you know, you might not necessarily target one by one, but you put yourself out

263
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,940
through some discomfort in case things are there. It's basically like taking antibiotics

264
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:20,980
to wipe the harmful bacteria. So you can aim at one or two, well, yeah, just you take

265
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:30,780
a generic one, and you know, it will be covered to do it long enough. It will address it.

266
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,820
So that's why that's what all the things means. Basically, if you go through all of those

267
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,380
ways, there was absolutely nothing for anyone in the world with the right view that would

268
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:48,220
be left. Because, you know, the things that you'll be destroying by seeing, but then, yeah,

269
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,460
so somebody there might be all. He might be, might be enough. However, most likely, there

270
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,420
will be some other things hiding elsewhere, and then basically by going through all of those

271
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:04,340
through restraint, through enduring, through hardship, through seeing, they will remain

272
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:11,100
nothing uncovered. Because again, like, like, like antibiotics, let's get back to them.

273
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,420
Some are good for respiratory infections, but you know, some bacteria is resistant to it.

274
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,420
So you might not necessarily have those bacteria, and okay, if you become an out of hand by

275
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:29,220
taking only one or two, by practicing only one or two forms of the destruction of taints,

276
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,420
that's fine. So if you become completely healthy by taking one or two antibiotics, that's

277
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:37,860
fine. But if you know that you've taken one or two sufficiently enough, but you're still

278
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,900
not fully healthy, okay, so there are issues elsewhere, then you try a different antibiotics.

279
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:52,300
So basically, if somebody who gains the right view, reviews their mind, and okay, I go

280
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,020
to the right view, but I'm not an out of hand. It means there are taints to be done, to

281
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:01,140
be done with, to be, to be, to be dealt with. And that's, that's when you, when you start

282
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:07,380
doing through restraint, got in the sense faculties. Okay, yes, sensuality might not be rising

283
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,420
anymore, but I still don't feel that I've reached the unsupervised security for bondage.

284
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:19,900
Okay, push yourself, take yourself out into discomfort, endure, avoid, and so on, and

285
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:25,500
then, yes, eventually, you covered all the bases, and the arhanship will have to be the

286
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:35,220
result. Yeah, that's what you said, avoiding the next one. Yeah, wisely avoid it. Yeah,

287
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:41,860
he avoids wild elephants. Exactly. So he recognizes that he's not an arhaniyet. Does he

288
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:47,620
need more time to apply himself? Thus, it will be very foolish to stand in front of the

289
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:54,740
wild elephant, because it, quite likely, it will result in his death. Same with the wild

290
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:03,180
dog, charcoal, no, no, no, sorry, cesspit, cesspit, cesspit, not, yeah, cliff, cliff,

291
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:10,420
cliff, things they can kill you. Unsuitable seats, wandering, unsuitable places. Yeah, things

292
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,020
they can compromise you, things they can kill you. Yeah, bad friends. Yeah, things they

293
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:25,340
can distract you from the go. Avoid it. Thanks be to God by removing, which is gone. Here

294
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:31,780
a bicker reflecting properly does not tolerate an arisen thought of central desire. He

295
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:37,100
abandons it, he removes it, does away with it, annihilates it, or an a thought of ill will,

296
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:43,420
a thought of cruelty. He does not tolerate arisen evil unwholesome states. He abandons

297
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:51,980
it, removes it, does away with it, annihilates it, tends to be abandoned by developing. He

298
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:57,260
reflects why it develops mindfulness and lightening factor, which is, he develops the

299
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:04,940
seven factors of enlightenment. And each factor is supported by seclusion, dispassion, cessation,

300
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:14,020
and ripens in the linkishment. What do you think that means? Seclusion, dispassion, and

301
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:26,180
cessation. Each mindfulness factor is supported by seclusion. Yeah, seclusion for my wholesome

302
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,460
states. Dispassion. Dispassion. Dispassion. Dispassion with results in dispassion, because

303
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,460
you are not attracted to things anymore, cessation of suffering, cessation of lust, the version

304
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,460
delusion, and the linkishment, freedom, and the freedom.

305
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,460
Here ripens in the linkishment. Yeah. So those, that, because, is it, is it? Yeah.

306
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:52,300
And a bicker who dwells restrained with the strength of all the taints, he has severed craving,

307
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,780
flung off the fetters, and with the complete penetration of conceit, he has made an end

308
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:03,780
of suffering. This was the best one said, the bickers were satisfied and delighted in the

309
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:28,780
best ones words.
