00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Go. If you are seeing things in the right way, then something that you know is unskilledful,

00:20.000 --> 00:33.000
say lust comes up, and there is a red flag or you can feel the tendency there or the pressure there,

00:33.000 --> 00:43.000
but you don't, but then the mind goes into that, just investigating it, just naturally like,

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
okay, now go a red flag, this is unskilledful, why is it unskilledful?

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
The dominant start falling, why is it unskilled? Because in a classroom, you're not getting wisdom out of this,

00:57.000 --> 01:06.000
it's not peaceful, it's agitated, it's the problem, where is it based on the body,

01:06.000 --> 01:15.000
that body over there, it's not mind, with that view of that situation,

01:15.000 --> 01:27.000
while that situation, it's not like if lust comes up, that is automatically a problem.

01:27.000 --> 01:39.000
No, because you're not free from it, so because you're not free from it, you have to be doing all of which you just described,

01:39.000 --> 01:50.000
because you're not free from the nature of lust, because you're still subject, or you're still liable to lust,

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
it means all those things, now it's sort of going in the right direction, but it's still not there,

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
because when I say going in the right direction, I mean, yeah, so you're trying to understand the nature of lust,

02:02.000 --> 02:16.000
so to prevent the future arising, because as I said, the problem is much deeper than just one particular arising of one particular lust,

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
or whatever, the problem is that it is able to arise, means lust remains possible,

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
and you're not free from the possibility of your mind being infected by lust, or by aversion, or whatever,

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
so that's what you need to strive at, so when the lust arises, if there is a pool, or if the angle arises,

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
if there is an aversion, or whatever you want to call it, that's a problem,

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
so that's already a problem, the fact that that possibility of anger, and now the actual anger, affects you,

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
so whatever you do then, will be an account of that lust, will be an account of that anger,

02:57.000 --> 03:07.000
so that's already not good, fundamentally speaking, but it's still within that of, it's not ideal,

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
since you cannot but not do anything, because you're not free from the nature of it, you're not free from the nature of lust,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
so you will end up whatever you do, will be because of the reason of lust,

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
so then the best, and that's what you can do, is aim that whatever you have no choice but to do,

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
is aim that undoing the nature of the lust, so restraint, reflection that undermines the nature of lust and so on,

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
so yes, that's a form of response, which means, and if you need to respond, means you're affected,

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
so as I said, for a protrusion, or in the case of the creation of you, or that's not a snake, that's a rope,

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
well, you have to go and find out it's a rope, that's completely misdirected, that's directed outside, projected onto the thing,

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
so if, and there is a natural tendency, like if there is a lustful object causing, like,

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
infecting your mind with lust, you're trying to find the fault in the object, or find the fault in the object that causes you the anger and stuff,

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
and that's already misplaced, so you have to be able to accept it, accept responsibility for it,

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
means we stand at a rising, for as long as he wants to rise, which I wait, he wants to rise,

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
and then, you have to think carefully, and wisely basically make that whatever you do,

04:37.000 --> 04:47.000
won't be misdirected at the particular thing, or internally or externally, or both tonight,

04:47.000 --> 04:58.000
you won't be thinking about, like, feeling bad about you, or hating on the object, or hating on yourself,

04:58.000 --> 05:08.000
whatever, you want to do, a type of reflection that will end at that possibility of lust, of a version of delusion,

05:08.000 --> 05:17.000
of the fact that you are still subject to it, whether the present arise and just reminded you of that, then you're still subject to it,

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
but when you start dealing with it, you want to develop your effort, so to speak,

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
that they transcend the particular concern about this lustful object, or that hateful object,

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
but start dealing with the nature of lust and nature of hate, and it's extra hard in the beginning,

05:35.000 --> 05:43.000
because the mind is pulled by the object, and the problem means the object, but actually it's not,

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
that's why delusion is a habit that's been cultivated for so long, so now the assumption that what has arisen now,

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
what bothers me, whether in, by causing lust or aversion, that's the problem, I need to deal with it,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
and you feel immediate satisfaction, because you dealt with it, one way or the other,

05:59.000 --> 06:07.000
and you gave in or overcome, and that's still misplaced, but the more you look at it,

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
the more that becomes obvious, that actually, yeah, I might be able to deal with this particular problem,

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
with this particular arising, with a particular thing that I just perceived, but what if I can't?

06:20.000 --> 06:29.000
Or, more likely, and everybody experienced that, yeah, I could deal with it, and I dealt with it, and then what, until the next one comes along,

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
and then the next one, and then the next one, and then the next one.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I know, yeah, and I would not deal with something like that.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I would dealt with it completely, and it's like, oh, okay, I've already done so much.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
So that type of escape, it's not really an escape, you don't want to have to do anything,

06:48.000 --> 06:58.000
so as I said, in that Hindu Christian example of, oh, you have fear arising on a kind of snake that you just seen,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
that's it.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
Now they say, ah, but then you look closer, and then turns out it's a rope,

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
therefore your fear was not real, that's completely misdirected,

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
because what if you can't look closer, or what if you look even closer, and you find out it's a snake?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
That looks like a rope.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
You don't want to have to do anything on a kind of thing,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
because that means, well, it's good or bad, you're affected by that thing.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
If you need to respond to it, if you need to find out that the rope, that that snake is a rope,

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
means you were affected by the nature of the arising of a thing.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
So once you start thinking like that, whether you see a snake or a rope,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
there's a matter.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
You see, I think fear arose, that's the problem, that's what you deal with it,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
and you're not concerned to go and look closer to see if it's a rope,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
because ah, yeah, good, then my fear is not real.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
That particular fear turned out to be unfounded,

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
but finding out it's unfounded, it's a different experience from the original fear.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
So even if it was the actual rope, the two thought it was a snake,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
it was a real experience as such.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
It was experience of something I think is a snake that turns out actually to be a rope

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
that is frightening me.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
So that's why that doesn't work, and that's why psychology doesn't work either,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
in terms of freedom from suffering.

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
It always requires this management response in regard to things that arise and both of you.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
And again, you just stop and think about it, yeah, I might be able to deal with this,

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
but now I am able to walk and find out that it's a rope.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But what if I can't do it?

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
Then I remain affected by this fear that might be unfounded or not,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
but either way, it is real as such, because you can say, oh, it's not real,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
the fear is not real, because that might be a rope.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
You can say even that, but even then, in that case,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
the experience of unreal fear is still frightening.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
So where do you label it real, or unreal, or both, or neither?

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
The fact that on the level of feelings there is suffering, that's the problem.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
So it requires a magical belief that unreal frees me from suffering.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
The only connection between the two is the ignorance,

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
not knowing that actually your suffering remains unaffected.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
And that's how it works.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
You see as something a snake, whatever arises,

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
there is always an implicit possibility of it being otherwise.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And that's just the nature of things.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
So in the same way, oh, I saw a snake, fear arose.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
If you don't misplace the problem, if you don't project it out onto that thing

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
that you just perceived, if you just take it as a reminder that

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
you can still be frightened, means you're not free from the nature of fear,

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
regardless of any particular manifestation of it, an object that manifests it,

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
then if you find out one way or the other, that it's a rope,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
then that experience of the rope is the experience of the rope

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
that I thought it was that snake.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
So there is a relief on the particular level,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
but if you look at it as an nature thing, it means,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
next time it might actually be a snake.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
The next time I might see a rope, that I think it's a rope and I'm not afraid,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
then I come closer and I realize it's a snake.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
So how does then, like this interpretation of Christian stack up,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
saying, oh, well, see, it was a rope.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Therefore, your fear and your whole experience is an illusion,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
there's nothing to be afraid of.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Well, what if it's either way around?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
What if you think it's a rope, but then it's a snake,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
because there are snakes in the world, then what?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Then you hold on.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Now this illusion, you can still call it an illusion,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
but it doesn't reduce your fear anyway.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Because you can say, oh, crap.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
The experience of non-threatening things

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
can be threatening if I find out closer.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
So your reverse completely,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
but that's why you need a belief and blind belief,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
whereby you only look selectively at the things that suit you.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Because in reality, actually,

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
the letter belief is more closer to the nature of things,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
whereby you think that everything can be a snake.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Why? Because an arising of things, in general,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
upon which your existence depends,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
and is defined by, will see, eventually, death.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
So rather than like, oh, no, it's all illusion, I'm fine.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
You can undo it and say, well,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
even the pleasure that I'm experiencing here,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
or even the peace that I'm experiencing here,

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
in that sense, you can say, it's illusory,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
because it will come to an end.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
But then you realize that's not the illusion they talk about.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
They talk about the illusion selectively,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
denying its existence,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
because that temporarily, momentarily,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
frees you from fear.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
But even if there is a mistake,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
like if you're perceiving something that is not like that,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
that experience of a mistake,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
experience of illusion is real as such.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
And it's irrelevant,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
in a sense, because whether it's real or illusory,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
the fact that it can make you feel,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
that's where the problem is.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Feeling is the problem,

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
not what you've just perceived or not.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
So just thinking of that becomes apparent that,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
well, thinking of that,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
will make the attitude of denial saying,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
oh, the world, the experience, this is not real,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
this is not real.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
It will make it basically hollow,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
impotent.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh, it's leaking here.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
It will make it impotent,

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
because it works only if you don't look at the other side of the picture.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
It's not real, it's the denial,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
that frees you from temporarily,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
well, seemingly frees you from,

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
oh, I'm relieved now, it was actually a rope.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
But as I said, if you reverse,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
and then don't stop this,

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
yeah?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Denire your rope.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Denire your snake by finding out it's a rope.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Now, deny that rope.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Denire that piece as well.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Why do you stop there?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
If you only go to deny this pleasure,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
as a former escape,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
well, why do you,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
like you can't in good faith,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
then don't deny peace.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
So I'm relieved of what if it's a snake.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
And it just shows you that things are subject to change,

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
even if they don't necessarily change.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
And then you realize,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I cannot control.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Things changing.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Thus, the peace I feel now

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
on account of this particular change

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
is out of my control too.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And that's frightening.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
But then at the same time,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
the suffering that I feel on account of these things right now

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
is also out of my control.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And that's liberating.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
So now you want to bend in both.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You want to realize that, well, actually,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
it's irrelevant.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Whether it's, I think,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
it's real or not real.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
The fact is, it arises as such.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And as such, my feelings depend upon it.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
And as such, I have no control over them.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
And that's why Arhan doesn't feel pleasure.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
No, this pleasure.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
He's not subject to, you know,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
to, like, delight and lustful excitement

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
and that form of pleasure.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
No, he's subject to suffering.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Because both are seen as dependent upon

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
things that arise externally.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And as such, something that is

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
fundamentally beyond your control.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
He's seen the day you change the result.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
That's it.

15:35.000 --> 15:47.000
The danger, the gratification and the escape.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
The gratification being just basic.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Sorry?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
The gratification being of things arise.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Well, there is a degree of pleasure.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
So gratification is confirmation and delight

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
and rejoicing in that pleasure.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
But you have to start seeing that pleasure,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
whether you're gratified or not,

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
as impermanent, as lonely,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
unworthy and attractive.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Because, hey, look, they're similar from the suitors.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
They're a big cup of beautiful beverage

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
pleasing in every sense.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
So, they smell nice,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
nice, nice, nice,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
resistance in everything.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Nice taste.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Now, it looks beautiful,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
but it has poison in it.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
You cannot detect,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
but you know that there is a poison.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
So, that's still there.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
It's not real.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
And the joy of drinking,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
of experiencing that taste,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
is also real.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
If you don't know that it has poison,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
you'll drink it and you'll enjoy it.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
If you know that it has poison,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
well, you'll drink it,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
and your mouth will still enjoy it.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
But you won't enjoy it,

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
because it will be overpopulated or overloaded.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Overrided.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Overrided.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
It will be overridden.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Well, it will be overwhelmed

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
by the fear of the knowledge

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
that actually you are drinking poison.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
So, you won't drink it.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
No matter how pleasing it is,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
fully discerning the danger,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
the poison in it,

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
you will not give in to the gratification of it.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
So, there is no...

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
That's why,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
you mustn't deny things,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
even beautiful and chanting things,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
because by denying them,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
the natural gratification is being denied,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
and you're not understanding it,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
which means you're still trying to buy it.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
So, obviously, that's when you should indulge.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
I mean, like, no,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
that means going to drink poison, no.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
You have to refrain from drinking poison,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
but you have to recognize

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
that the validity of its pleasure

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
still stands on certain level,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
on the level of taste,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
on the level of sight,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
on the level of smell, touch, ears.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
On that level,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
it remains,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
but you can discern through that,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
and then the knowledge,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
because that knowledge cannot be perceived.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Poison is undetectable.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
So, the whole idea of Krishna

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
escape, of denial,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
my illusion reality,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
just doesn't work,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
because there are certain things

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
that have only been known,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
not perceived.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
So, you can go and see that the rope is a snake,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
and the snake is a rope or whatever.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Or you can do a scientific experiment,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
and find out that it has traces

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
of what if it's undetectable

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
by any means,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
you can approach it through your senses.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
When the only thing you have is a thought,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
that there is a poison in it,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
which is why it's so hard to develop.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
But if it is developed,

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
no amount of pleasure coming from the five senses

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
can actually take you back there,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
because the knowledge is developed

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
on a more fundamental level,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
that precedes the senses

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
in that structural sense.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So, they just,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
they're powerless then.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
If you know that there is a poison,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
if you calculate that thought enough,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
obviously, if there weren't no poison in centrality,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
no matter how much you think that there is a poison,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
it would not get established.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
But because in reality,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
there is a poison in centrality,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
thinking that there is a poison

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
will eventually yield the result

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
of you recognizing that poison in a knowledge,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
which is how the dama works.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
If the things that the Buddha taught about

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
were not actually already there in those things,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
you thinking of things

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
will not be able to take root,

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
which means I don't think you will not be possible.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
But because those things are there,

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
thinking according to the way that those things are,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
will eventually make you recognize

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
that those things are there.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
But it takes time, which is why

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
the repetition is necessary for practice.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
It's not you see it once,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
like you move the curtains

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
and you see what's outside.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
No. You need to keep doing it,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
and doing it, and doing it,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
until that almost,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
that artificial view of looking for poison

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
that you don't see, you don't detect nothing.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Get so established,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
and when it's established,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
then you will actually see the poison,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
see the danger.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
And because that danger was truly there,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
your practice corresponded to it,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
even without your knowledge,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
and then it got confirmed,

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
and now you know.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And that's what that was the same.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That's like transition from puttuja

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
into a saltabana.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
He doesn't know in the beginning,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
but he's doing it,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
and looking at things correctly,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
according to the nature of things,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
he doesn't know.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
So there is that faith,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
as the first step necessary,

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
that he had to take on something,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
he doesn't know if it's right,

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
even the Buddha's teaching,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
and then he kept doing it,

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
doing it, doing it,

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
and because it was right,

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
because it was how things were,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
then that becomes apparent eventually,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
and then it's confirmed from him,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
so he doesn't need any more faith.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Now he sees directly for himself

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
that those things are there.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Which is why you have the

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
centralities, one of the types of,

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
one of the assumptions,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
one of the opadanas.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
That's exactly how it works.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
You just assume something based on not knowing,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
but then you have no reference to know.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
So you have to accept and trust

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
that there is a poison in centrality.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
And then whenever there is a pleasure

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
or pull or enchantment or delight,

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
you keep like pasting the idea

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
of poison over it.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
So it's artificial,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
because you're not seeing it.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
But because it is actually there,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
and you have faith that it's actually there,

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
it will sort of take its roots,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
much like when you graft a plant,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
you bring a completely alien different plant,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
different tree, different branch to this tree.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
And you graft it.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
And then it takes over,

22:15.000 --> 22:22.000
and then it merges and becomes a new tree.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
That's how you actually have to take the view externally,

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
which is why an utterance of another is necessary.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
And obviously knowing how to apply it.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And that's why we refer to the darkness,

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
the ancient part,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
that was already there just gets obscured.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
If it weren't, no monografting can take root,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
because it doesn't correspond to it.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
And that's why it's necessary

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
for a Buddha or somebody of that standard,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
so to speak, to rise in the world,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
because it's not enough to see it once.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Like you might want to think that there is a poison

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
that centrality is unwanted.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
But unless you have faith,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
unless somebody told you that you have to keep seeing that

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
over and over and over again,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
you won't do it.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Which means that the true nature of

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
poison and the danger of sensuality

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
will not be discerned.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Because it's not enough to do it once,

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
which means you can't do the dharma by accident,

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
or by luck, or by sheer chance.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Or by sheer chance,

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
I realize that there is a poisonous sensuality.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Because it's undetectable.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
So basically that knowledge,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
or there might be a poison,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
even if you don't see it.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
That's the most you're going to get,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
a possibility, but even then.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
So that's why someone's pathogen

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
can't free themselves from sensuality.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
There is a possibility of this beautiful

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
tasty beverage being poisonous,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
as a similar.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
So there is always that possibility.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But unless you have a good reason

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
to entertain the possibility,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
and act according to it,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
you won't do it.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Because it just seems unreal,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
actually.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Seems face, seems artificial,

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
seems imaginary,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
because it is on that level.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
But if you keep doing it,

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
turns out there was a poison

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
and now you're liberated from it.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
So you can't have pathogens

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
free from sensuality.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So it's the same principle

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
like that when it comes to self-view.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
But you can't do that by yourself,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
because it's yourself doing it.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
So you have to take on something completely externally

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
by somebody who already done it

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
and then keep doing it.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And then eventually,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
it will correspond to the nature of things,

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
which is that nothing can be yourself.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
So it's the same principle

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
of it's undetectable,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
because your whole experience is about yourself.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Someone says, well, it's not self.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
So you can hear, oh, okay,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
there's no self.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
There's no self.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
But then there's no self.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
It's the experience of yourself.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
So you have to discern

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
the lack of self

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
in the reason things.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
But you can't perceive,

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
you can't see it,

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
you can discern it.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
So the mind comes first

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
and all the senses meet in the mind,

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
and so on.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Which is why again,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
the common contemporary interpretation

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
of impermanence

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
as a flux and things changing

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
and the modern science has proven

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
that nothing is permanent

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
because the atoms are like,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
that's all based on perception.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
And the starch makes no difference.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Yeah, I can say this chair is unreal,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
but if I'm personal,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I attach to that chair.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
And even if I know

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
it's unreal,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
you're breaking it.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I'll suffer.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I've got my attachment.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
How many of you say it's not real?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I've seen things externally.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
It's whether it's real or not real

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
or moving or not.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
As such, it is real.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
The fact that it has a reason

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
means it's real.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Oh, that's just delusion.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Delusion is real.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
So the type of the danger

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
of the escape with the gratification

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
and the escape is something

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
you cannot perceive through your senses.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
So saying that all the objects

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
are impermanent,

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
oh, this is all changing constantly.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
That makes no difference.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Because as such,

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
as changing constantly,

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
it's real.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
And as such,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
you're not free from the nature

26:45.000 --> 26:58.000
of the rising.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Yeah, nature is not impermanence.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
And nature is basically

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
the impermanence

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
in terms of,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
well, things that think

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I think is impermanent

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
because it has a reason.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Not because you witnessed its cessation.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
Whatever has the nature of a rising

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
for that reason

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
is subject to nature's ceasing,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
even if it's still persisting

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
right in front of you.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Because depending on something

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
that I have no control of.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Well, yeah.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Well, that's something

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
that becomes apparent

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
if you're still looking

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
at the manifestation of things.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
And when I say manifest,

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
I don't mean like

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
seeing things through your senses

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
or something.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
I mean them manifesting

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
as phenomena,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
which is sometimes through a sense

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
through a sense,

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
sometimes through a mind.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
So even the biggest

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
weird delusional thoughts

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
are really such.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
You can designate them,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
you can talk about them.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
You cannot perceive them

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
by your five senses,

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
but you can perceive them

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
by your mind.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
They're there.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
So that's all real.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
So you have to acknowledge that

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
and then it becomes apparent

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
that whatever has the nature of a rising

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
is out of your control.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Like you have no say.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Well, actually,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
you have no access

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
to the point that they are rising

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
from where they are rising.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
They're just there.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
You just find them already there.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
So even if you're just witnessing

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
something appearing,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
when that thing appears,

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
appears as if

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
it's there beforehand.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Simultaneous.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Not necessarily time-involving time.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Or yes, this can be asked to know.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Simultaneous appears

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
as something before.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
So for that reason,

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
you realize the roots,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
the foundations of that thing

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
are inconceivable,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
inaccessible to you.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
And that's what impermanence is.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Even if that thing remains standing

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
for the rest of your life,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
which is actually your body,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
you can't let everybody disappear

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
and get destroyed

29:01.000 --> 29:09.000
and you still remain standing.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
And things are around these

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
because, well,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
it's possible for them to run

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
because consciousness.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Well, yes.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
See, but even that.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
There has to be consciousness.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
You can't see that directly.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You can explain that.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Because the consciousness.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
But then you're conceiving that consciousness

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
as the cause of the rising of the things.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
That's you're conceiving it as yourself.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
You're enclosed within the five aggregates

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
and they're manifested.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
For the reason they're manifested,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
they are impermanent.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Is enclosed within the five aggregates.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
You can't step outside of them.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
So you can't say consciousness.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Is this consciousness? Is that?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Well, you can't do that.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
It's because you can't face.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Yes.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
But you can...

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Well, no.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
In terms of all of the aggregates.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
You cannot own them.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
You can just...

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
You can describe it.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Well, yes, but your description is such.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Appropriate to them.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Saying consciousness is the reason for this.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You're just appropriated it.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
So I can't say it arises

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
like this particular thing.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Whatever it is.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
My hand arises within consciousness.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Within the...

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
Self-consciousness. No.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
No.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Because that would mean like consciousness

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
is some sort of vessel.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
And which things appear.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Which means you take the ownership of the vessel.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
But arises with consciousness.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Well, within your whole experience

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
is within the five aggregates and closed.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
So when you have the experience of my hand

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
as a reason,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
the experience of having a hand

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
that is realizing in your experience

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
is within already.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
You can't step outside of it.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And saying that arises

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
inside of the consciousness

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
or inside of this means stepping...

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
means putting it into something.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Which means you adapt.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Which is outside.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
You become the vessel

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
in which things arise.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Therefore you become its owner.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
No.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Whatever the aggregate is manifested.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
It's found there beforehand.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Seal teniously is manifestation.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
So whether it's a perception of your hand

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
or your feeling

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
or just the knowledge of something

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
means

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
it's manifested.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
And you have no say in that manifestation.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
You have no say.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Absolutely no say.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
They arise on their own accord.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
They persist on their own accord.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
And that's within that.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
That's why they're impermanent.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
So again,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
witnessing something disappear

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
means taking an external view

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
in regard to their disappearance.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
And as such,

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
their disappearance will not pertain to a

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
a Nietzsche,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
which is the personal impermanence.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
The impermanence that frees you from suffering.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Well, because you're just with witness

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
to the external,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
which means that which was witnessing

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and it remained unaffected by it.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
But if you recognize,

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
well, it's not because

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
cessation of things

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
is something that's manifested.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
And as such,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
it's impermanent

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
because it's manifested,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
not because it's ceasing.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
So rising is manifested.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Cessation is manifested.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Persisting while changing is manifested.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
All of those things are impermanent.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Impermanence is in regard to all of them.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
Not just bound with cessation.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
Well, the dead nature of impermanence

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
is superimposed to any of those

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
particular manifestations of it.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
It's on a different level.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Simultaneous to present,

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
inseparable from,

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
but on a different level.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
It pertains to the nature of things.

33:01.000 --> 33:11.000
A rising, the nature of arising,

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
the nature of ceasing,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
the nature of persisting while changing.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Well, the three things have come.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
They have a nature.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
A nature.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
That nature is manifested

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
and as such,

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
it's impermanent for the reason

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
that it's manifested.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
If you were able to be a creator,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
if you were able to be a creator,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
you would be able to take the possession

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
of cessation, that thing,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
which means you can have it as long as you want,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
but you can't.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
You can't even conceive,

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
you can't even access the point

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
where things manifest.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
You just find them as manifested,

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
even if it's simultaneously right now.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
And as such,

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
when they cease,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
that's also inaccessible to you.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Which is why the aggregates cannot be actually assumed

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
in the first place.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
They cannot be held by up and down in the first place.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
