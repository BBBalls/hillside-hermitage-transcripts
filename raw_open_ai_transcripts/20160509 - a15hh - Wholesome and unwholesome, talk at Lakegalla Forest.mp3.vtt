WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
So the first step is that if you know for yourself what's wholesome as wholesome, wholesome,

00:08.840 --> 00:13.960
wholesome as unwholesome and then you can see increasing in you or decreasing you and

00:13.960 --> 00:19.040
then you can see sometimes circumstances being responsible for it, sometimes not when

00:19.040 --> 00:22.840
they are you know what all life exchange is in certain times, if they're not, if it's

00:22.840 --> 00:28.040
not the circumstances to be blamed then you are, I'm not making enough effort or I'm becoming

00:28.040 --> 00:33.840
careless or something like that, but either way comes down to being self-transparent and

00:33.840 --> 00:38.280
you see through that and then knowing how to act because as I said if you see that

00:38.280 --> 00:46.440
at like initial stage you don't need a great amount of effort to keep it on the course.

00:46.440 --> 00:51.800
So for somebody sure too don't like this might be great but then also living in a secluded

00:51.800 --> 00:57.800
is great, if I don't have a secluded and I'm living through them well I'll just keep doing

00:57.800 --> 01:03.080
what I have because it's good enough, if I have secluded and I don't have to go through

01:03.080 --> 01:15.240
them well I'll keep doing that, it's not black and white and it's determined basically

01:15.240 --> 01:32.920
by your message that you need to be honest with yourself about and it's often actually

01:32.920 --> 01:42.080
more about recognizing what unwholesome is because if there is no unwholesome you most likely

01:42.080 --> 01:49.160
can practice wholesome when you're doing fun, that's the thing once you can recognize

01:49.160 --> 01:57.320
the unwholesome and keep that at bay then I can start moving more freely and I might

01:57.320 --> 02:04.520
happen if that's my thing to go through them, because there is no increase in unwholesome

02:04.520 --> 02:08.920
and even the one that and then you can exactly within that you can start defining it further

02:08.920 --> 02:13.160
oh not just that there is no increase in unwholesome, there is also a decrease in unwholesome

02:13.160 --> 02:22.600
so I might do that more now, yeah, if you don't know what you're doing and you're just

02:22.600 --> 02:28.160
trying to take an external form on an expectation that that would, well most of the most of the

02:28.160 --> 02:42.000
practice is exactly that, but it's not such a thing, there is not such a thing as half

02:42.000 --> 02:58.080
a practice for you, yeah good luck with that, but yeah, people who project

02:58.080 --> 03:03.320
for other whom is place where the practice is, would hold on to the rules is practice,

03:03.320 --> 03:08.360
would hold on to the etiquette is practice, would hold on to observances is practice as

03:08.360 --> 03:12.800
a virtuous practice and it's nothing other than still about the Paramahansa, and those

03:12.800 --> 03:16.920
same people would also think circumstances of practice, to monastery of the practice,

03:16.920 --> 03:23.800
keeping up to the routines is a practice, never ever using any of those things like as

03:23.800 --> 03:29.880
a basis to reflect upon their mind themselves choosing, intending, being responsible for all

03:29.880 --> 03:35.400
of that in the first place, so that's why you know you can spend 50 years in roles as

03:35.400 --> 03:39.640
a monk following all the routines perfectly, doing everything perfectly, but never have

03:39.640 --> 04:09.520
a moment of proper reflection, so basically as you asked before what if the seconds

04:09.520 --> 04:16.520
are provided both, wholesome and a wholesome, it's a wholesome day, you know you might have

04:16.520 --> 04:25.520
a pot of curd, shillunk and curd, and half of it is good, half of it went off, and it's

04:25.520 --> 04:33.840
all kind of mixed, even good bit is off, because you can distinguish it, so you want to focus

04:33.840 --> 04:40.840
on not having the increase of one wholesome, but not having the increase of one wholesome,

04:40.840 --> 04:47.240
that's already wholesome, and then you take that further through your effort, refining

04:47.240 --> 04:53.760
the circumstances, refining the things you do throughout the day, you take that further

04:53.760 --> 04:58.320
so that it starts to bring in the increase in one wholesome, but again all of this turns

04:58.320 --> 05:03.800
to the very general wholesome and wholesome, they need to be like that, general like that,

05:03.800 --> 05:07.560
because that's how you recognize them, you recognize the nature of one wholesome, the

05:07.560 --> 05:16.560
nature of wholesome, and exactly as we said before, for somebody walking around charikas

05:16.560 --> 05:22.760
and pudongs, but then out of complete restlessness, or some romantic ideals, and you know lots

05:22.760 --> 05:29.840
of monks do, lots of monks live quite a number of months really harder, and two dongs

05:29.840 --> 05:36.600
or whatever else, and then they come in common civilizations, they fall apart, they get angry,

05:36.600 --> 05:40.240
they get angry, they get lost, they get pissed, they disrobe, and you know what you've been

05:40.240 --> 05:44.920
doing all this time walking around, you clearly haven't been practicing, because if you were

05:44.920 --> 05:50.640
you wouldn't be affected by those unwholesome states when they do eventually rise.

05:50.640 --> 05:55.280
So the whole point is, whatever you choose to do as a form of practice is to be fortifying

05:55.280 --> 06:00.960
yourself, against the farmers, against the hindrances, and become stronger, and obviously

06:00.960 --> 06:07.160
develop wisdom through that, but if you know somebody, again perfect monk keeps all the

06:07.160 --> 06:23.320
things, sits eight hours a day, and then he dissolves, well, but did that do to him?

06:23.320 --> 06:38.920
Maybe things that stir you up, and so you think, I'm fine, yeah, and people often would think

06:38.920 --> 06:44.920
that, yeah, they would often think that if there is no transparency to recognize, okay, I'm

06:44.920 --> 06:49.920
fine now, but would I be fine if those things would arise, they unwholesome things, would

06:49.920 --> 06:56.080
they go into the city, going into the village, every day, for his arms, they have to keep

06:56.080 --> 06:57.080
his strength?

06:57.080 --> 06:59.680
Well, exactly, that's where you can see it.

06:59.680 --> 07:04.480
Because you know, often people would stop and wonder, why are monks not allowed to grow

07:04.480 --> 07:07.880
the food, because you can go and live on top of the mountain, drawing around food, and

07:07.880 --> 07:08.960
never see anywhere?

07:08.960 --> 07:13.600
Well, that's exactly why, because lots of people use that as a form of escape, and never

07:13.600 --> 07:22.560
develop any wisdom, and on top of that, means the dharma wouldn't actually be drawn to others,

07:22.560 --> 07:28.560
but by being in some marginal contact, with lay people, with people who are not monks,

07:28.560 --> 07:33.520
who are not practicing, they get to see it, they get married, and you actually get to

07:33.520 --> 07:38.440
be kept in check, like yourself, you get to measure, you get to measure, you get to see

07:38.440 --> 07:42.640
whether your hindrance is arising, decreasing, if you just live in your mountain, you get

07:42.640 --> 07:47.640
used to that, you have your own comfort, self-sustainable, you don't see any, oh yeah, it's

07:47.640 --> 07:51.880
nice and romantic, but it's quite likely you aren't going to be pushing yourself as hard

07:51.880 --> 07:57.360
as you should, but these things will prevent you from being complacent.

07:57.360 --> 08:02.000
So there needs to be that kind of, ah, okay, no, I do dependant people, so I can't just

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
run off.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
But you can't go now, you know, in the middle of it, you go and catch it in a bar, kind

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
of thing.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.760
Oh, I'm going to test myself, if you're older, they have a mental state with testing

08:14.760 --> 08:18.840
yourself, you're older, they're affected by the nature of those things, because if you

08:18.840 --> 08:22.720
are not affected by nature of those things, well, if you're not affected by the nature

08:22.720 --> 08:27.840
of things you're testing yourself in regard to, you wouldn't need to test yourself.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.320
Means, but if you're doubting whether you're going to be affected or not, that's already

08:32.320 --> 08:38.320
a form of being affected, but if you're doubting, oh, with these sites affecting me, so I

08:38.320 --> 08:45.200
go and test myself, means, well, you're already affected by that doubt.

08:45.200 --> 08:49.760
And then you needed to prove that to yourself, ah, by going and testing, you're exposed

08:49.760 --> 08:53.240
going to the town or to a bar to see how you're going to react.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.040
That's just completely like a wisdom.

08:55.040 --> 09:00.400
First of all, oh, I'm trying to overcome this, thus any exposure won't help, even in

09:00.400 --> 09:04.520
a form of testing myself, why would I need to test myself if I know this needs to be

09:04.520 --> 09:10.200
well done, and truly overcoming something is when you become indifferent towards it.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.880
And then even the idea of testing yourself means, well, why would I need to test my strength

09:13.880 --> 09:15.520
when I know I'm strong?

09:15.520 --> 09:17.760
I don't need to go and keep flexing.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.960
But if you doubt whether you're strong enough, then you have to go and keep doing that.

09:22.960 --> 09:27.840
So what you want to do is not keep testing yourself in silly, unwise ways, you actually

09:27.840 --> 09:30.640
want to remove the doubt in regard to it.

09:30.640 --> 09:31.640
And that's it.

09:31.640 --> 09:38.640
And for as long as I demand seal, nothing can enter to it.

09:38.640 --> 09:50.000
Okay, so again, I'm a bit lost, but if I'm sitting in the crew team, and I can't,

09:50.000 --> 09:59.080
yeah, I can't down, nothing's going on, it's just neutral, neutral feeling generally.

09:59.080 --> 10:15.120
Yeah, I can easily become complacent, but I have to keep on looking where, where do I have

10:15.120 --> 10:17.120
to keep going?

10:17.120 --> 10:23.880
Well, if everything is, if there are no disturbances of any kind, you do have sutras, you do have

10:23.880 --> 10:28.600
study, and you do have knowledge that you are not sotapana yet.

10:28.600 --> 10:35.400
Which means there is a task for me to do, and all the circumstances are quite suitable,

10:35.400 --> 10:38.480
so I need to do it, I need to keep doing it.

10:38.480 --> 10:43.760
I think even a state of just.

10:43.760 --> 10:48.320
Then once you become sotapana, get the right view, then it's purely about recognizing

10:48.320 --> 10:51.440
wholesome and avoiding unwholesome.

10:51.440 --> 10:57.000
And if you stick to it with restrained, with renunciation, with things that are required

10:57.000 --> 11:02.720
for different people, for different mindsets, different predispositions, that's it.

11:02.720 --> 11:06.920
If you stick to it, as Janavira said, by practicing neck and a sun couple, the thoughts

11:06.920 --> 11:11.560
of renunciation and intention of renunciation, you become like a tower of strength.

11:11.560 --> 11:15.520
And then, you know, the knowledge arises and so on, and the person becomes tired, over

11:15.520 --> 11:17.000
comes sensuality and so on.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.640
All this everything is to start with the right view, there is no practice, there is no right

11:22.640 --> 11:23.640
view.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
Yes, yes, yes.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.720
The right view makes the whole noble age of path, right?

11:27.720 --> 11:31.080
There is no such thing as you get this, a bit of that, a bit of this.

11:31.080 --> 11:38.240
So you have the suitable enough circumstances, get the right view, spend the time trying

11:38.240 --> 11:40.240
to get the right view.

11:40.240 --> 11:46.040
And you know, there are like, again, many different ways you can get to the right view.

11:46.040 --> 11:51.000
Obviously, it's the right way, the same understanding of the same nature, but if people can

11:51.000 --> 11:56.560
arrive through contemplating different things, contemplating wholesome and unwholesome, wise

11:56.560 --> 12:02.000
and wholesome and wholesome, avoiding it, abandoning it, not tolerating, not entertaining

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
it.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.320
When the mind gets like, it used to wholesomeness, you start recognizing it, you start grasping

12:09.320 --> 12:12.720
the sign of your own mind.

12:12.720 --> 12:17.240
And then, you know, the impermanence and other things become much easier to sort of see

12:17.240 --> 12:24.240
in the right context.

12:24.240 --> 12:31.720
I need to ask you, like, need a clarification about something, just that, I read and I heard

12:31.720 --> 12:42.720
about this something called one-check-a-dama, basically sort of like, illusion or sort of,

12:42.720 --> 12:49.720
basically, I don't know how, like, for me, it sounded like an unwholesome, unwholesome

12:49.720 --> 13:01.720
nature of a thought or a process, but there was this article, but it was written by a monk,

13:01.720 --> 13:08.120
it was about having unwholesome, wholesome and a third to be one-check-a-dama, basically

13:08.120 --> 13:15.120
when you recognize something to be wholesome, but in reality, it's unwholesome, for example,

13:15.120 --> 13:25.200
like, let's say this dog, like, goes on and I'm trying to catch that hair and I stop it.

13:25.200 --> 13:31.240
In a way, I'm saving the hair, so I do have good merits or sort of wholesome, but then

13:31.240 --> 13:38.080
again, I'm stopping the dog, or in the process, I get the dog, right, right, and so what

13:38.080 --> 13:41.080
is the, what's the question, what's the context of that?

13:41.080 --> 13:42.080
What are you saying?

13:42.080 --> 13:48.600
I'm asking, like, basically, is there a third, like, that sort of thing, like, one-check-a-dama

13:48.600 --> 13:57.680
is there, is it a third sort of act or sort of thought process, or is it still just unskillful

13:57.680 --> 13:58.680
and...

13:58.680 --> 14:03.080
A third as opposed to wholesome, unwholesome, and then wholesome and unwholesome.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.080
Yeah.

14:04.080 --> 14:10.280
Yeah, there is, there is meditaries, the meditaries, and now the meditaries are no meditaries,

14:10.280 --> 14:16.680
so basically saving somebody, saving the life of, again, something, something is more,

14:16.680 --> 14:17.680
something's less.

14:17.680 --> 14:23.680
So, if you just prevent the dog from eating by preventing him from killing a hair and

14:23.680 --> 14:27.680
you save the life of that hair, that's obviously more wholesome.

14:27.680 --> 14:31.760
It's unwholesome if you're going to end up committing, but it's not as unwholesome

14:31.760 --> 14:34.360
if you kill the dog.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.400
Well, if you kill the dog, that's much worse here, because you wouldn't have been killing

14:38.400 --> 14:41.480
the hair in the first place, it would have been the dog.

14:41.480 --> 14:46.600
So, again, you always need to look it from your point of view, from the point of view of

14:46.600 --> 14:51.560
your action, like, you know, locked in the people when they say, well, what if I killed

14:51.560 --> 14:55.560
one person who was about to kill 500, I saved 500?

14:55.560 --> 15:00.880
Well, it wasn't your responsibility to save 100, but it was your responsibility to not

15:00.880 --> 15:01.880
kill anyone.

15:01.880 --> 15:02.880
Yeah.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.880
And you can't avoid that, as well.

15:04.880 --> 15:05.880
Yeah.

15:05.880 --> 15:11.260
So, yeah, there are things that the neither pleasant or untranslatable, neither

15:11.260 --> 15:14.480
militaries nor militaries, neither good nor bad, mixed.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.480
Be the both, or be the bad.

15:18.480 --> 15:27.720
Yeah, the one-taker means, like, sort of, like, but why is there a relevant, I don't

15:27.720 --> 15:34.720
understand what to, because there was, in that article, it was divided into three sections,

15:34.720 --> 15:40.920
rather than having wholesome, or unwholesome, for, like, when it's wholesome, or unwholesome,

15:40.920 --> 15:45.560
you know, if this is wholesome, this is wholesome, if it's not wholesome, to me, sounds like

15:45.560 --> 15:51.040
that article was talking about, comma, and then the ritual, if we park of it, like, all

15:51.040 --> 15:55.160
what you do, that is good comma, or your bad comma.

15:55.160 --> 16:17.760
But, basically, the term one-taker means one-taker is in, like, dishonest, old, like, to

16:17.760 --> 16:26.280
con some one sort of thing, like, so this dumbness, this, this, this, makers, are conning, or this

16:26.280 --> 16:27.280
honest sort of.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.800
But, again, it's always in relation to an act of one kind or the other, so I suspect the

16:30.800 --> 16:34.400
whole article was written with that in mind, like, you know, because you are, I do good,

16:34.400 --> 16:38.600
I'll be reborn in heaven, or I'm making merit, well, there are things that con you think

16:38.600 --> 16:42.040
you're doing good, but you're not, but that's not what we've been talking about, in terms

16:42.040 --> 16:46.880
of wholesome, and unwholesome, in terms of practice, is what you recognize where your

16:46.880 --> 16:51.800
intention is rooted, whether your intention is rooted in greed, aversion, delusion,

16:51.800 --> 16:55.720
if you recognize your rooted in that, you do not do it.

16:55.720 --> 16:56.720
Yeah.

16:56.720 --> 17:01.440
So in that sense, there is no neutral there, basically, it's either good, or it's either

17:01.440 --> 17:02.440
bad.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.640
Yeah, that's the problem.

17:03.640 --> 17:10.960
And if you start seeing like that, recognizing that it's not rooted in bad, that's what

17:10.960 --> 17:16.840
makes it good, good for the practice, that's what it means, suitable for the practice.

17:16.840 --> 17:23.920
And from the point of view of karma, like if what you've done happens to be like this

17:23.920 --> 17:31.400
or like, well, you've done that, but you will know for sure that it's impossible to have

17:31.400 --> 17:37.880
an action, a deed done while it was rooted in wholesome, not in unwholesome, to result

17:37.880 --> 17:40.520
in unwholesome, you can't have that.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.960
So you kind of bring it back to the source, you stop speculating about this particular thing

17:44.960 --> 17:50.000
means that, or if I do this, if you mean that, or, no, you just bring it really, really

17:50.000 --> 17:55.320
to the source, which is your intention, and then you know, my intention was not rooted

17:55.320 --> 17:59.760
in unwholesome, and you don't have anything to worry about.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.560
But if you don't see that, then yeah, then you have to worry about external and what

18:02.560 --> 18:07.520
other people say, it's good or bad, and then you're trying to get your way by pondering

18:07.520 --> 18:08.520
on those things.

18:08.520 --> 18:12.680
But actually, you just need to bring it down to the very point of origin, and then you

18:12.680 --> 18:13.680
will know.

18:13.680 --> 18:23.240
So, I think that's more about, again, about authenticity of it, it's absolutely prerequisite

18:23.240 --> 18:25.640
for everything right.

18:25.640 --> 18:37.920
It's like, you can think of something as you're doing wholesome, but you're ignorant to

18:37.920 --> 18:38.920
a little more.

18:38.920 --> 18:50.120
Yeah, I mean, you know, people think various things that are socially or in the environment

18:50.120 --> 18:53.720
you live accepted as good and wholesome, but you can be doing it for completely unwholesome

18:53.720 --> 18:54.720
reasons.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.720
And it's those reasons that matter.

18:57.720 --> 19:07.640
Yeah, it's not the external, traditional way of people, what people say, no one knows

19:07.640 --> 19:10.640
what wholesome and unwholesome is.

19:10.640 --> 19:15.400
It's accepted based on, kind of, some general knowledge, but it's not something that's

19:15.400 --> 19:16.400
on the cell accurate.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.400
Whatever you're asking to do, it might be.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
Yeah.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.400
Whatever is the case.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.400
Yeah.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.400
Oh, it's good.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.040
This is the right to do it, but why are you doing it?

19:25.040 --> 19:30.840
Like things can be externally neutral, nobody would mind, but you know you're doing it

19:30.840 --> 19:33.480
for absolutely wrong reasons, so you're going to do it.

19:33.480 --> 19:38.640
And sometimes things can be perceived negatively externally, people can complain, but you'd

19:38.640 --> 19:43.360
know you're not doing it for the bad reasons, so you don't have to worry about doing it.

19:43.360 --> 19:53.480
So what it comes down to is that, like, can I say, like, if it's wholesome, like, if

19:53.480 --> 19:59.480
it's not wholesome, it is unwholesome, if it's not unwholesome, it is wholesome.

19:59.480 --> 20:05.680
And it comes down to the mind where your intentions are rooted, like, if it's neutral, then,

20:05.680 --> 20:09.920
okay, it's not unwholesome, that's all it matters.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.840
There can't be a neutral position, can it?

20:11.840 --> 20:15.320
Well, it can be, like, certain, like, it doesn't affect anyone, it doesn't affect you,

20:15.320 --> 20:19.800
it doesn't affect others in any way, in any shape of form, it doesn't affect anything.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.160
But what about your volition, like, the intuition?

20:22.160 --> 20:25.000
Well, even your volition doesn't really affect, doesn't care.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.420
It doesn't come from my wholesome, it doesn't come from greed, it doesn't come from

20:27.420 --> 20:29.720
delusion.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.040
And in that sense, from the point of view of the practice, it's wholesome, that neutral

20:33.040 --> 20:40.520
it's wholesome, because, well, it's certainly not an obstacle.

20:40.520 --> 21:00.520
So, in between greed, abortion, and delusion, and wisdom, generosity, and, like, the counter

21:00.520 --> 21:01.520
of those three.

21:01.520 --> 21:06.600
Well, the counter of greed, the version delusion is non-greed, non-version, and non-delusion.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
Non-delusion, yeah.

21:07.600 --> 21:14.640
So, between those six, there's no other intention left, right?

21:14.640 --> 21:21.760
If you're, if you're intending to doing something, either one of those things, or a modification

21:21.760 --> 21:22.760
of those things.

21:22.760 --> 21:26.920
In terms of where it's rooted, exactly, yeah, you have it by that, because, as you say

21:26.920 --> 21:30.760
yourself, and as, you know, things in some case, there's a bit of mix, but the fact that

21:30.760 --> 21:37.760
it's mixed, with unwholesome means, well, it's rooted in unwholesome.

21:37.760 --> 21:46.720
Yeah, that's why I wasn't here a while ago.

21:46.720 --> 21:52.040
And then if it's rooted in neutral, in a sense of, well, there's no greed, and non-greed

21:52.040 --> 22:01.040
either, it's just complete indifference, by being like that, well, that's, that's wholesome.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.040
So, if there is no greed, it's a non-greed.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.040
Yeah.

22:05.040 --> 22:11.600
If there is both greed and non-greed, in regard to various things, well, that's greed.

22:11.600 --> 22:18.120
So the difference would come down to, like, the neutral feeling, for example, when it's

22:18.120 --> 22:23.120
neither pleasure, nor this pleasure, it's being felt.

22:23.120 --> 22:29.720
And it's actually a lot of the feeling, but if that feeling is not known, it's unpleasant,

22:29.720 --> 22:33.920
it's delusional, it's unwholesome.

22:33.920 --> 22:44.680
If that feeling is known, it's pleasant, and it's wholesome, and it's peaceful.

22:44.680 --> 22:50.400
And it's, in itself, it's a neutral feeling, in that sense, you would have, like, a neutral

22:50.400 --> 22:54.800
intention that doesn't result, neither in good, nor in bad.

22:54.800 --> 23:00.000
But if it's unknown, as such, if it's not recognized for what it is, it's unwholesome.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
If it's recognized for what is, it's wholesome, oh, okay.

23:07.000 --> 23:15.800
So it's like your intention towards your feelings.

23:15.800 --> 23:20.680
Because the intention towards the feelings would be whether there is craving, if it's a

23:20.680 --> 23:24.320
proper intention, there wouldn't be craving, it's improper, there would be craving, in regard

23:24.320 --> 23:26.680
to whatever you feel, good or bad or neutral.

23:26.680 --> 23:32.360
If it's a proper intention, there's going to be craving, what's the proper intention?

23:32.360 --> 23:39.360
The proper intention would be intention that would not lose the sight of impermanence.

23:39.360 --> 23:47.360
For example, okay, keep having, keep having, keep having, keep having, keep having, keep

23:47.360 --> 24:02.360
from having that in perspective, because it, there's that, what none of you ever wrote,

24:02.360 --> 24:11.360
real quotes, I can't remember how to say exactly, any intention, which doesn't imply craving,

24:11.360 --> 24:19.000
I think you understand?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Yeah.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
An intention.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
What is the, has the rest of the question there?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
All that comment there.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Well.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
An intention that doesn't imply craving.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.400
A half thing can be understood.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.560
Because how can you say, why?

24:31.560 --> 24:37.120
How can you intend something without craving, without, that's just the duties towards feelings

24:37.120 --> 24:38.080
that one has.

24:38.080 --> 24:45.080
Well, basically the intention of effective ignorance will be

24:45.080 --> 24:50.080
kind of over-intending, you can say, which is when you're craving.

24:50.080 --> 24:56.080
But because there is no beginning of your craving, you've always been over-intending.

24:56.080 --> 25:00.080
So the question is how to now learn through that over-intending,

25:00.080 --> 25:04.080
through that craving for things, how to learn that actually intention can be

25:04.080 --> 25:09.080
without you needing to over-intending or doing anything about it.

25:09.080 --> 25:13.080
So it's more like discerning within that over-intending intention,

25:13.080 --> 25:19.080
what in itself is just intention, and what is your doing on top of that?

25:19.080 --> 25:21.080
Well, what you're doing.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.080
And recognition, for example, of the fact,

25:24.080 --> 25:28.080
well, recognition of intentions as phenomena is the very first step.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.080
Yeah.

25:29.080 --> 25:32.080
Because most of the people when they think intention, they immediately

25:32.080 --> 25:37.080
that's my evolution, my direction, like, oh, intending this, intending this.

25:37.080 --> 25:42.080
It's always, it's like a direction, being directed that way or this way.

25:42.080 --> 25:46.080
And you don't see that as in the reason of phenomena.

25:46.080 --> 25:50.080
You see that in regard to being manifest in regard to reason of phenomena.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.080
Ah, this is the reason I'm going there.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.080
This is it, I'm going there.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.080
Oh, I'm running away from that.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.080
I don't want that, I want that.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.080
So it's always this movement.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.080
I'm thinking about this.

25:58.080 --> 26:06.080
So seeing the movement of your intention as a still phenomenon is the very first step.

26:06.080 --> 26:13.080
And that means grasping the sign of your mind, grasping the still sign of your moving mind.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.080
The thing is of your mind.

26:15.080 --> 26:19.080
Exactly, because changing while standing, the third characteristic,

26:19.080 --> 26:21.080
that's what movement is.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.080
Whether it's moving away or towards, or away and towards whatever,

26:24.080 --> 26:29.080
it's changing while standing or rather changing while remaining the same,

26:29.080 --> 26:33.080
resisting while changing, depending on whatever translation you're going to use.

26:33.080 --> 26:37.080
The point is, even if there is a movement, it can be not,

26:37.080 --> 26:41.080
towards or away, that movement is a thing.

26:41.080 --> 26:44.080
On a more general level, it's a single thing, single phenomenon,

26:44.080 --> 26:46.080
that it's sort of moving, changing on particular level.

26:46.080 --> 26:50.080
That's why the movement is possible, is because on a different level,

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
there is no movement.

26:51.080 --> 26:55.080
If everything is moving constantly all the time, everywhere,

26:55.080 --> 27:00.080
there wouldn't be movement at all, because it wouldn't be a reference point at all.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.080
So recognizing the nature of intention as a movement,

27:03.080 --> 27:09.080
but then being able to see that movement as a reason thing, while it's moving.

27:09.080 --> 27:16.080
They will eventually, could lead to discerning, ah, the aggregate of intention,

27:16.080 --> 27:21.080
the phenomenon of intention, means even the intention, even the most,

27:21.080 --> 27:25.080
the quickest moving things of your mind, like this, that, this, that.

27:25.080 --> 27:30.080
It's only possible, because it has a reason beforehand, as a whole.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.080
And over that, you have no say.

27:33.080 --> 27:37.080
So the only fact, you can move along a certain trajectory,

27:37.080 --> 27:43.080
is because the trajectory has been given to you as a possibility to move.

27:43.080 --> 27:46.080
And thus you can never create anything.

27:46.080 --> 27:51.080
You can just go along with what has a reason, based on your choice.

27:51.080 --> 27:55.080
And then you realize that even choosing left or right, or up or down,

27:55.080 --> 27:59.080
is only possible, because all those directions are implied, given.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.080
All those intentions are there.

28:01.080 --> 28:05.080
So you're completely enclosed within that.

28:05.080 --> 28:09.080
So there's many, there's infinite number of intentions,

28:09.080 --> 28:11.080
or directions you can go.

28:11.080 --> 28:20.080
Okay. But there is the thing called intention.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.080
But it can move indefinitely.

28:22.080 --> 28:26.080
You can say, let's say there is an infinite number,

28:26.080 --> 28:31.080
and infinite ways that intention can move.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.080
But all of those ways, all of those movements,

28:34.080 --> 28:37.080
are possible only if the intention has a reason beforehand.

28:37.080 --> 28:42.080
If there is no intention, you can't conceive a movement of that intention.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.080
And there's many intentions.

28:45.080 --> 28:48.080
You can say there is an infinite amount of movement,

28:48.080 --> 28:51.080
of the given reason intention.

28:51.080 --> 28:56.080
So you recognize, if the intention is the necessary cause,

28:56.080 --> 29:00.080
the phenomenon of intention, the presence of intentionality,

29:00.080 --> 29:05.080
is a necessary cause for any particular intention to be manifested.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.080
You recognize that any particular intention that you engage in,

29:08.080 --> 29:11.080
intentional intention, volition, whatever else,

29:11.080 --> 29:14.080
is completely subordinate, completely dependent upon,

29:14.080 --> 29:20.080
completely determined by the phenomenon of intention being present.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.080
And if you discern that, you would have,

29:22.080 --> 29:24.080
well, you have absolutely no say,

29:24.080 --> 29:28.080
and you can't intend the phenomenon of intention.

29:28.080 --> 29:33.080
Which means, you can't ever even conceive it to be yours.

29:33.080 --> 29:36.080
Yet, because of, upon that very thing,

29:36.080 --> 29:38.080
that is inconceivable to be yours,

29:38.080 --> 29:40.080
your whole volition, your whole sense of self,

29:40.080 --> 29:42.080
your whole intentionality, stands upon,

29:42.080 --> 29:46.080
and it's completely determined by an inseparable form.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.080
So by seeing that, and you recognize,

29:48.080 --> 29:51.080
no matter how hard I will something of it,

29:51.080 --> 29:54.080
it cannot, it's inconceivable to be taken as much,

29:54.080 --> 29:56.080
it's impossible.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.080
But fully discerning that impossibility,

29:58.080 --> 30:00.080
you'll stop taking it as yours.

30:00.080 --> 30:03.080
You're making a choice.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.080
That's very much as we used to think.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.080
That's where your sense of self sits.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.080
The fact that you're able to choose.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.080
But that's not, like again,

30:12.080 --> 30:13.080
it's such a point.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.080
So even potusion, I can get a hint of that.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.080
You might be able to choose,

30:17.080 --> 30:20.080
but while you're not able to not choose,

30:20.080 --> 30:22.080
because even when you say I'm not choosing,

30:22.080 --> 30:23.080
you've just chosen that.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.080
So you're completely,

30:25.080 --> 30:26.080
not to choose.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.080
Yeah, if so, I'm referring to the choice

30:28.080 --> 30:30.080
while you just chose to not choose.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.080
There's another choice.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.080
It was always a possibility,

30:33.080 --> 30:35.080
if you chose to refrain from choice.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.080
So you're always, which is wide,

30:37.080 --> 30:39.080
which is exactly, that's the core of it.

30:39.080 --> 30:43.080
The fact that you can't choose your way out of choice.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.080
You can't intentionally stop impending it.

30:45.080 --> 30:49.080
And that's exactly why you condemn to karma

30:49.080 --> 30:51.080
and then the eventual results of it.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.080
You can't stop performing karma.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.080
You can't stop performing action,

30:55.080 --> 30:58.080
which means you can't stop experiencing results

30:58.080 --> 31:01.080
no matter how far ahead they are.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.080
And that's why every intention,

31:03.080 --> 31:05.080
every action is intention.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.080
So if you condemn to such intentions

31:07.080 --> 31:08.080
that you're no escape from,

31:08.080 --> 31:10.080
means, oh, result will be,

31:10.080 --> 31:12.080
it will result in action eventually,

31:12.080 --> 31:14.080
which means, oh, whatever then results

31:14.080 --> 31:16.080
of those actions are,

31:16.080 --> 31:17.080
will fall onto me,

31:17.080 --> 31:19.080
even if I have no say over that.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.080
And you never had say in it from the beginning,

31:21.080 --> 31:23.080
but by not knowing that,

31:23.080 --> 31:25.080
you just kept doing it,

31:25.080 --> 31:26.080
and kept appropriating it,

31:26.080 --> 31:29.080
which means whatever came as a result of it later on,

31:29.080 --> 31:32.080
was also falling on your, on your, on your end.

31:37.080 --> 31:41.080
So all acts have results,

31:41.080 --> 31:46.080
but born Abraham, they don't.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.080
Well, on to anybody.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.080
Every action is intention,

31:50.080 --> 31:54.080
but then if you fully discern intentions,

31:54.080 --> 31:56.080
none of those intentions will be yours.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.080
Does anything that those intentions result in?

31:59.080 --> 32:00.080
No.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.080
Any acts don't actually,

32:01.080 --> 32:02.080
won't be actually act,

32:02.080 --> 32:04.080
because act, in a sense of karma,

32:04.080 --> 32:06.080
is when the intention is appropriated

32:06.080 --> 32:08.080
and they brought you to result in committing

32:08.080 --> 32:09.080
an action of a kind,

32:09.080 --> 32:11.080
which means then the results of those actions

32:11.080 --> 32:13.080
will also be yours.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.080
They will still be results.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.080
So you can't, like you can say,

32:16.080 --> 32:17.080
I'll stop performing actions,

32:17.080 --> 32:19.080
because action karma is bad.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.080
But if you don't address,

32:21.080 --> 32:22.080
if you don't overcome,

32:22.080 --> 32:25.080
if you stop appropriating your intention,

32:25.080 --> 32:28.080
means you're not really abstaining from any action,

32:28.080 --> 32:30.080
because from that point of view,

32:30.080 --> 32:31.080
even not performing an action,

32:31.080 --> 32:33.080
is a form of action.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.080
That you find it.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.080
Yeah.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.080
And sooner or later,

32:36.080 --> 32:37.080
you will be, you'll do something

32:37.080 --> 32:39.080
that will be resulting in one way or the other.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.080
You can't see,

32:41.080 --> 32:44.080
you can see intention directly.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.080
You can't, you can't.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.080
Well, you can see the movement,

32:47.080 --> 32:49.080
like if you're expecting to stop the intention,

32:49.080 --> 32:51.080
to stop the movement in order to examine it,

32:51.080 --> 32:54.080
means you're already looking at the wrong place.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.080
You can't have anything in there.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.080
The fact that there is a movement means

32:57.080 --> 33:00.080
there is the phenomenon of movement

33:00.080 --> 33:02.080
that is still,

33:02.080 --> 33:04.080
basically, literally,

33:04.080 --> 33:06.080
the trajectory you move

33:06.080 --> 33:08.080
has to be given beforehand.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.080
Otherwise, there is no movement.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.080
So you don't have to stop the movement.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.080
You just have to recognize its nature,

33:14.080 --> 33:16.080
which is not moving.

33:16.080 --> 33:19.080
Hence, the movement within that is possible.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.080
Well, you, for, um,

33:28.080 --> 33:29.080
intention,

33:29.080 --> 33:31.080
because, because,

33:31.080 --> 33:34.080
like if you want to phenomenologically describe it,

33:34.080 --> 33:36.080
it would be a movement.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.080
It's a movement,

33:37.080 --> 33:38.080
movement of the mind,

33:38.080 --> 33:39.080
movement of the speech,

33:39.080 --> 33:41.080
movement of the action,

33:41.080 --> 33:42.080
for the body,

33:42.080 --> 33:44.080
depending on how far it takes you.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.080
And the choice is a movement,

33:46.080 --> 33:48.080
because of this, over that.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.080
And while, because while you,

33:51.080 --> 33:52.080
you have chosen something,

33:52.080 --> 33:53.080
you choose something,

33:53.080 --> 33:54.080
and it's,

33:54.080 --> 33:55.080
and it's a bit...

33:55.080 --> 33:56.080
Well, that already implies

33:56.080 --> 33:58.080
the other things that you didn't choose.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.080
Yeah, but while I'm,

33:59.080 --> 34:01.080
I'm sitting now,

34:01.080 --> 34:02.080
but I'm doing that,

34:02.080 --> 34:03.080
so the mind,

34:03.080 --> 34:04.080
intention to sit,

34:04.080 --> 34:05.080
remains,

34:05.080 --> 34:07.080
as long as I,

34:07.080 --> 34:09.080
don't choose something else.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.080
It's able to require you to stand up.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.080
Yeah.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.080
So I'm constantly,

34:15.080 --> 34:17.080
if I wasn't choosing to sit down,

34:17.080 --> 34:18.080
I would be doing something else.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.080
Yeah.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.080
And now,

34:20.080 --> 34:23.080
you have made a choice of sitting down.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.080
Now, you're not actively,

34:25.080 --> 34:27.080
constantly choosing to remain seated,

34:27.080 --> 34:30.080
but the fact that you've made that choice,

34:30.080 --> 34:31.080
and your body is still seated,

34:31.080 --> 34:34.080
means you're actively engaged in that choice.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.080
Yeah, it's...

34:35.080 --> 34:36.080
So you're engaged, it's active.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.080
It's on.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.080
Yeah.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.080
Yeah.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.080
Which is why the fourth,

34:40.080 --> 34:41.080
um,

34:41.080 --> 34:44.080
body postures can be, can be a good foundation of mindfulness.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.080
Because within that,

34:46.080 --> 34:48.080
now, any intentionality that you have,

34:48.080 --> 34:50.080
will come from the intentionality of the seated body.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.080
Which means you can't,

34:52.080 --> 34:54.080
all of the other intentionalities,

34:54.080 --> 34:56.080
it would exist on account of a different body posture,

34:56.080 --> 34:58.080
are now excellent.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.080
Uh...

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
You can't,

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
like now,

35:01.080 --> 35:02.080
start intending things

35:02.080 --> 35:04.080
that would require you to run,

35:04.080 --> 35:05.080
or stand up,

35:05.080 --> 35:07.080
without running or standing up.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.080
Mm-hmm.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.080
So even if you think about it,

35:09.080 --> 35:11.080
that's not really intention,

35:11.080 --> 35:12.080
because it's not really as a possibility,

35:12.080 --> 35:14.080
it's just an extra thought,

35:14.080 --> 35:15.080
that you think,

35:15.080 --> 35:18.080
from the point of view of seated intentions,

35:18.080 --> 35:20.080
body in this posture,

35:20.080 --> 35:23.080
has these things at its disposition.

35:27.080 --> 35:30.080
But then, so what's the duty then?

35:30.080 --> 35:31.080
So I'm watching my mind.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.080
Well, the duty is,

35:32.080 --> 35:34.080
you don't really have to be analyzing,

35:34.080 --> 35:36.080
the domains of your intention,

35:36.080 --> 35:37.080
and what's given,

35:37.080 --> 35:39.080
and what's not. The duty is,

35:39.080 --> 35:41.080
to see that,

35:41.080 --> 35:43.080
whenever the movement is possible,

35:43.080 --> 35:45.080
whenever the movement is occurring,

35:45.080 --> 35:46.080
intention, relation,

35:46.080 --> 35:47.080
it's only because things,

35:47.080 --> 35:49.080
in regard to which you're moving,

35:49.080 --> 35:51.080
are given beforehand.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.080
As a more general thing.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.080
I've seen,

35:54.080 --> 35:55.080
impermanence.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.080
Exactly, thus,

35:56.080 --> 35:58.080
any movement that occurs,

35:58.080 --> 35:59.080
that will occur,

35:59.080 --> 36:00.080
that has occurred,

36:00.080 --> 36:01.080
is within.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.080
It's now seen within,

36:02.080 --> 36:05.080
that inherent impermanence.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.080
Which means,

36:07.080 --> 36:09.080
you do that long enough,

36:09.080 --> 36:11.080
any movement,

36:11.080 --> 36:13.080
no matter how quick,

36:13.080 --> 36:14.080
how fleeting,

36:14.080 --> 36:15.080
or whatever else,

36:15.080 --> 36:16.080
will not be taken as mine.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.080
Why?

36:17.080 --> 36:20.080
Because it's impossible to be taken as mine.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.080
So you dwell on it long enough,

36:21.080 --> 36:22.080
and then it becomes apparent,

36:22.080 --> 36:23.080
that there is no movement

36:23.080 --> 36:24.080
without a still thing

36:24.080 --> 36:25.080
being given beforehand,

36:25.080 --> 36:26.080
for which,

36:26.080 --> 36:27.080
just if I was given beforehand,

36:27.080 --> 36:28.080
you had no say,

36:28.080 --> 36:29.080
in its origin.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.080
You're able to make a choice,

36:30.080 --> 36:32.080
you must have things to choose.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.080
Yeah.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.080
Options, yeah.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.080
Well, yeah.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.080
A nice option.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.080
Option would be more particular,

36:38.080 --> 36:39.080
like proliferation,

36:39.080 --> 36:41.080
but just if I did,

36:41.080 --> 36:43.080
to be able to make a choice,

36:43.080 --> 36:46.080
you have to be able to move,

36:46.080 --> 36:48.080
mentally.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.080
Which means,

36:49.080 --> 36:50.080
in order to move mentally,

36:50.080 --> 36:51.080
the mind needs to be there

36:51.080 --> 36:53.080
beforehand.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.080
So instead of chasing the movement,

36:55.080 --> 36:57.080
you actually use movement,

36:57.080 --> 37:00.080
like as an indication,

37:00.080 --> 37:04.080
of the fact that the mind is still.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.080
Hence, the sign of the mind,

37:12.080 --> 37:31.080
chitta mimita.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.080
And then,

37:32.080 --> 37:33.080
then,

37:33.080 --> 37:34.080
blow me nothing,

37:34.080 --> 37:36.080
I put it's craving thing.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.080
Well, craving,

37:37.080 --> 37:39.080
is possible for as long as

37:39.080 --> 37:41.080
there is sense of eye out.

37:41.080 --> 37:43.080
Then,

37:43.080 --> 37:45.080
I am intending this means,

37:45.080 --> 37:46.080
basically, I am craving this.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.080
But once you start realizing

37:48.080 --> 37:49.080
that it's completely redundant,

37:49.080 --> 37:51.080
and that actually you can be

37:51.080 --> 37:53.080
intending and moving

37:53.080 --> 37:55.080
as a result of, you know,

37:55.080 --> 37:57.080
five aggregates doing just that.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.080
On their own,

37:59.080 --> 38:01.080
not requiring you.

38:01.080 --> 38:03.080
Then you won't.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.080
Yeah.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.080
You won't be needing to crave

38:06.080 --> 38:13.080
anymore in any way.

38:37.080 --> 38:41.080
Yes, well, suppose that the

38:41.080 --> 38:43.080
equation comes up,

38:43.080 --> 38:45.080
means I'm,

38:45.080 --> 38:48.080
if I am not the one intending,

38:48.080 --> 38:51.080
then,

38:51.080 --> 38:53.080
who's going to be responsible

38:53.080 --> 38:54.080
for the choices?

38:54.080 --> 38:55.080
Well, that's the thing,

38:55.080 --> 38:56.080
that I'm going to make.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.080
The question who implies

38:58.080 --> 38:59.080
someone,

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
and the implication of someone

39:01.080 --> 39:02.080
means, well,

39:02.080 --> 39:04.080
the sense of self is still there.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.080
So, whether you have

39:06.080 --> 39:07.080
that sense of self as

39:07.080 --> 39:08.080
internally or externally,

39:08.080 --> 39:09.080
or both,

39:09.080 --> 39:11.080
it's still there.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.080
So, oh, well,

39:12.080 --> 39:13.080
if it's not me,

39:13.080 --> 39:14.080
who is it?

39:14.080 --> 39:15.080
It means, well,

39:15.080 --> 39:16.080
the general,

39:16.080 --> 39:17.080
then the nature of the

39:17.080 --> 39:18.080
self-view is still there,

39:18.080 --> 39:19.080
because now you're looking

39:19.080 --> 39:21.080
for somebody else.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.080
But if you start seeing

39:22.080 --> 39:23.080
that even that movement,

39:23.080 --> 39:24.080
that looking,

39:24.080 --> 39:25.080
that intending,

39:25.080 --> 39:26.080
that thinking,

39:26.080 --> 39:27.080
is possible because

39:27.080 --> 39:28.080
things are given before,

39:28.080 --> 39:29.080
you just start,

39:29.080 --> 39:32.080
including everything properly.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.080
And if you do long enough,

39:34.080 --> 39:36.080
then it will sort of,

39:36.080 --> 39:38.080
um,

39:38.080 --> 39:40.080
cancel out the things

39:40.080 --> 39:41.080
that were never meant to be there,

39:41.080 --> 39:43.080
in the first place.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.080
You sense of self craving,

39:44.080 --> 39:45.080
you know that,

39:45.080 --> 39:47.080
because now that is required,

39:47.080 --> 39:48.080
it's completely done.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.080
That's what Nihanna

39:49.080 --> 39:51.080
really felt as a parasite,

39:51.080 --> 39:53.080
upon gratuitous parasite,

39:53.080 --> 39:55.080
but completely beginningless.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.080
So, it's no first point

39:56.080 --> 39:57.080
that ignorance is manifest

39:57.080 --> 39:58.080
before which you were

39:58.080 --> 39:59.080
not ignorant,

39:59.080 --> 40:00.080
but actually,

40:00.080 --> 40:02.080
ignorance is not supposed to be there.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.080
It's not required.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.080
Hence, when you know that,

40:05.080 --> 40:06.080
you're not ignorant.

40:06.080 --> 40:07.080
There is no,

40:07.080 --> 40:08.080
no, no, no, no,

40:08.080 --> 40:08.080
no, no, no, no,

40:08.080 --> 40:10.080
no, space in between.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.080
So, are either ignorant

40:11.080 --> 40:14.080
or you're not ignorant?

40:14.080 --> 40:15.080
Knowing that ignorance has no

40:15.080 --> 40:17.080
room removes ignorance.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.080
It's mutually exclusive

40:21.080 --> 40:23.080
video and I will show you,

40:23.080 --> 40:25.080
come.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.080
Knowing that you're seeing

40:28.080 --> 40:29.080
things in the wrong way,

40:29.080 --> 40:41.080
Well, knowing, for example, that you can't own things in the first place, not knowing that makes you own them, through that not knowing.

40:41.080 --> 40:45.080
Hence, a Vigia is responsible for your sense of self, for your appropriation.

40:45.080 --> 40:57.080
Knowing fully and discerning fully that you can't actually own them means Vigia is responsible for your disown and complete removal of appropriation.

40:57.080 --> 41:05.080
And that's the thing, you will know that you can't own them and you see them fully determined always, by that which is a reason beforehand.

41:05.080 --> 41:14.080
You are not saying that, which is a reason, or whatever arises would be determined by this, that has a reason beforehand.

41:14.080 --> 41:18.080
So I can't even conceive to own it.

41:18.080 --> 41:25.080
The only way you can conceive to own it is when you forget that it's determined by that which is a reason beforehand.

41:25.080 --> 41:39.080
And the practices in discerning, and that's the whole particular part is discerning the connection between the two.

41:39.080 --> 42:00.080
And the connection is that connection of dependence, determination, being determined by, being inseparable from Sankara.

42:00.080 --> 42:09.080
Because it's not that there's nothing else in your experience than the five aggregates, by the Patryunal Narahand, whether you've been experienced, you're not.

42:09.080 --> 42:14.080
It's just the five aggregates, one way or the other.

42:14.080 --> 42:19.080
But you want to discern the way they arise.

42:19.080 --> 42:32.080
So within that which you already have, which you've been experiencing, within that you need to start discerning the right things. That's why the correct instruction is absolutely crucial.

42:32.080 --> 42:41.080
Like you can have all the right attention in your life, if there is nobody telling you what you need to attend properly.

42:41.080 --> 42:50.080
How? You simply wonder, you wouldn't know how. Because there is no immediate confirmation whether it's right or wrong.

42:50.080 --> 42:59.080
Only after repeating it for five hundred thousands of times, then the confirmation, ah, okay, yes, I see this. I see the direct connection.

42:59.080 --> 43:12.080
But you would be repeating something, five hundred or thousands of times, they doesn't bear any fruit initially. Only if somebody tells you that you should keep repeating it, they eventually will show it.

43:12.080 --> 43:18.080
So that's why you can't stumble upon them accidentally. You can't accidentally become a sort of honor.

43:18.080 --> 43:32.080
Oh yeah, all the luck. You just told the right thing at the right time. Impossible. You need to think the right thing at the right time for thousands of times. Just repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition until it wears out the ignorance.

43:32.080 --> 43:41.080
When it's worn out sufficiently for you to see over it, imagine again, like a tall tree as you can see anything from whatever.

43:41.080 --> 43:48.080
And then you're just hacking away and hacking away and hacking away. And you still don't see anything because it's tall, she's still.

43:48.080 --> 43:59.080
But when you have hacked away sufficiently, you start to see. And then you know, oh, this hacking is actually working because now I have a degree of confirmation.

43:59.080 --> 44:10.080
And that's all about it. You keep hacking further. Now you know for sure you have it confirmed for yourself that this hacking works in such and such way and you keep doing it and then eventually you'll see nothing.

44:10.080 --> 44:17.080
You see what you need to see.

44:17.080 --> 44:38.080
But if nobody tells you, I mean, you can stop the thing for yourself. If nobody tells you that repeating something away of attending things, away of reflecting.

44:38.080 --> 44:43.080
If that is the right thing and if you don't have faith in what they told you, that's the right thing.

44:43.080 --> 44:54.080
I mean, what are the chances of you yourself doing something right that you don't know that is right and then doing exactly the same thing on and on and on for no apparent reason.

44:54.080 --> 44:59.080
Perhaps you don't know the apparent reason because nobody told you externally, you should be doing nothing.

44:59.080 --> 45:04.080
While everything, your whole experience is directly completely the opposite way.

45:04.080 --> 45:12.080
It's impossible. It's literally impossible. That's why it's impossible for somebody to arrive at the right view just by accident.

45:12.080 --> 45:19.080
So if somebody says, oh, yes, happened. I've done this monitor treat and it happened to me.

45:19.080 --> 45:25.080
You most likely know they don't know what they're talking about because it doesn't happen to you. You develop it.

45:25.080 --> 45:34.080
And if there's something, if something you develop, if there is something that you developed, you will know how you developed.

45:34.080 --> 45:42.080
Thus, Sotapana knows that he knows. He's not just like, oh, yeah, it happened to me. I don't know how I can put it in the words, but it happened.

45:42.080 --> 45:46.080
There's lots of nonsense. There's a spiritual mystical talk.

45:46.080 --> 46:00.080
But if you've done something for thousands of times internally and then you have to confirm for yourself that it works, it's freeing you from suffering directly here and now, then you will know that.

46:00.080 --> 46:27.080
And you will know how to, no matter how not eloquent person you are, you still be able to say at least that it should repeat thousands of times how you've done it.

46:27.080 --> 46:34.080
So that's why the utterance of another is one of the two factors for the right view. The other one is proper attention.

46:34.080 --> 46:41.080
So you go the utterance and then you keep properly attending it on and on and on.

46:41.080 --> 46:46.080
But if you don't have proper attention, you can have all the right utterance of other people all the time.

46:46.080 --> 46:57.080
As you know, sometimes people did. They lived with the Buddha all the time but never became anything because they never properly attended.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.080
Proper attention.

47:00.080 --> 47:11.080
Proper attention is all this where we've been talking about. Proper intention.

47:11.080 --> 47:22.080
But that's another thing. Like, you need to know, or you need to, well, I'm sure you know, but you need to keep in mind that it doesn't happen overnight in a sense.

47:22.080 --> 47:31.080
Oh, I just need to do it once rightly. It happens if you just keep doing it.

47:31.080 --> 47:39.080
Like drilling, training, drilling.

47:39.080 --> 47:46.080
Similarly, the similar of the axe handle in the soup is like a carpenter who uses his axe every day.

47:46.080 --> 47:52.080
He doesn't know. Well, he said basically the wooden axe wouldn't handle. He uses it every day.

47:52.080 --> 47:57.080
And then each time, you know, he grips it, he's wearing it down.

47:57.080 --> 48:03.080
But you can't look at it and say, oh, today I've worn down my handle this much or that much.

48:03.080 --> 48:10.080
Only after, you know, years of using it, one day you're looking, oh, it's really thin.

48:10.080 --> 48:15.080
I've really worn this handle down. And that's how ignorance is being removed.

48:15.080 --> 48:21.080
It's the same sense, same feeling. Like, if you just keep doing it and you keep doing it,

48:21.080 --> 48:27.080
and then there will be a point where, oh, my ignorance diminished.

48:27.080 --> 48:36.080
But you can't say on a daily basis, oh, today diminished this much. Tomorrow it will diminish this much.

48:36.080 --> 48:41.080
You can notice how much you've been attending on a daily basis.

48:41.080 --> 48:45.080
Attending, would you mean? Like, practicing.

48:45.080 --> 48:55.080
Well, you can notice how much effort you've been putting on a daily basis, but you can't have a direct confirmation how much fruit that will bear.

48:55.080 --> 49:03.080
When you do, then you'll be more confident in. Then you'll know, oh, yes. Attending like this has resulted in confirmed confidence now.

49:03.080 --> 49:09.080
And then, obviously, you're your own guide. You know what to do. You know how to do it.

49:09.080 --> 49:16.080
But until then, you just have to keep doing it and trying to make it as right as possible without knowing whether it's right or not.

49:16.080 --> 49:24.080
Because that's the thing. If there is something you need to repeat for thousands of times and then eventually recognize it as right.

49:24.080 --> 49:32.080
Well, you won't know before you repeated thousands of times whether it was right or wrong.

49:32.080 --> 49:36.080
And you will know whether it was right or wrong only if it was right what you've been doing.

49:36.080 --> 49:39.080
Because then you go to criteria whether it was right or wrong.

49:39.080 --> 49:47.080
That's why it's so important to discern the instruction and really understand, try to understand and constantly respond and read the suitors

49:47.080 --> 49:57.080
and talk with people you think they know the suitors, not just like the followers of the day or the day or the day of the ceremony, but really to try to understand.

49:57.080 --> 50:01.080
Trying to understand can lead to understand.

50:01.080 --> 50:12.080
But one thing for sure, you can't understand something accidentally without making an effort.

50:12.080 --> 50:21.080
Yeah, but in able to see these things in the sense, you know, some people you can't be busy person.

50:21.080 --> 50:24.080
No, you need to dedicate your life to it.

50:24.080 --> 50:28.080
You need to dedicate your whole time to it.

50:28.080 --> 50:39.080
You can't, okay, you start contemplating and really getting into that mode and then you know, your phone rings, you have to go, you have to do this, you have to do that person, it's done.

50:39.080 --> 50:44.080
Then the effort will be getting back to the starting point.

50:44.080 --> 50:48.080
Not even starting, it's getting back to the point where you can start.

50:48.080 --> 50:52.080
So no, you can't be busy.

50:52.080 --> 50:57.080
Not even this kind of life, wondering something.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.080
Yeah.

50:58.080 --> 51:01.080
Well, I think wondering would work if you get a right view.

51:01.080 --> 51:02.080
Yes, yeah, okay.

51:02.080 --> 51:13.080
When you know how to already attend things and then you would be attending because there are like, it's physical challenging, it's tiring, it's uncomfortable and everything else.

51:13.080 --> 51:14.080
You get to see it.

51:14.080 --> 51:25.080
And as nice as this forest is, there are lots of things that can bother one in many ways, insects, rain, rock, mud, whatever, whatever.

51:25.080 --> 51:27.080
I don't know.

51:27.080 --> 51:32.080
But none of that would be a reason for you not attending properly, once you know how to attend properly.

51:32.080 --> 51:37.080
If you don't know how to attend properly, then yeah, everything can be a distraction for you, everything in the drug.

51:37.080 --> 51:40.080
So you won't, that's just a far fly, I think, in my face.

51:40.080 --> 51:44.080
Everything, everything can be a distraction for you.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.080
So you really want to minimize that.

51:46.080 --> 51:54.080
Still use the transparency that you have as putugina to know, okay, I'm not just avoiding things, I'm not just going out to them because I'm restless.

51:54.080 --> 51:59.080
Or I'm not just staying in my country because I fear discomfort.

51:59.080 --> 52:05.080
You find a balance of what you think is right, because you don't have a criteria that's right or wrong as putugina.

52:05.080 --> 52:09.080
And then you just have to, okay, do I have time to read the sutras?

52:09.080 --> 52:12.080
Do I have time to meditate, do I have time to contemplate?

52:12.080 --> 52:17.080
Whether I sit and meditate and contemplate, whether I walk, meditate and contemplate, I do have time, okay.

52:17.080 --> 52:24.080
Do I have time, like what other is the environment supporting me, keep the seal, keep the winner, it is.

52:24.080 --> 52:31.080
There are no distractions, there are no unwholesome things happening, that's those criteria as a matter, that's it.

52:31.080 --> 52:35.080
That's more than enough for somebody to be making effort.

52:35.080 --> 52:40.080
But then you know, you can be, oh, do I have enough time? No, I don't.

52:40.080 --> 52:46.080
Am I not being this, well, I'm being disturbed all the time, but people, you know, mingling with laypeople all the time

52:46.080 --> 52:49.080
because after this, after that, well, that's not wholesome.

52:49.080 --> 52:59.080
Well, then you certainly won't be able to expect that you will have enough time to dedicate, like, contemplating the meanings you grasp from the sutras,

52:59.080 --> 53:04.080
like constantly reflecting, constantly drilling, and drilling, and drilling.

53:04.080 --> 53:08.080
Because it's a hard work as it is, you don't need any other.

53:08.080 --> 53:14.080
So, yeah, by all means, before you get the right view, yeah.

53:14.080 --> 53:19.080
Run away from the crowd, leave the world, whatever else.

53:19.080 --> 53:24.080
Then later on, you might see even more, oh, actually, I don't have to go this far from people.

53:24.080 --> 53:27.080
I don't have to run on top of the mountain because I'm fine here.

53:27.080 --> 53:31.080
The mind works well here. I can still be progressing here.

53:31.080 --> 53:36.080
You definitely have to calm down and have a still place.

53:36.080 --> 53:41.080
Until such time, you can be, you can dry enough.

53:41.080 --> 53:48.080
Fair alone, like rhinoceros, the first, the first, the sotapan, the nyanavira quoted.

53:48.080 --> 53:52.080
I've gone beyond the withering of the views that we put in the monument.

53:52.080 --> 53:55.080
Nobody's my own guy. Fair alone, like, yeah.

53:55.080 --> 53:58.080
Once you become your own guy, then fair alone, like rhinoceros.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.080
Not before that.

54:00.080 --> 54:06.080
Because then you'll be fairing like a dumb rhinoceros, pumping into trees and stuff.

54:06.080 --> 54:09.080
Yeah.

54:09.080 --> 54:12.080
Yeah.
