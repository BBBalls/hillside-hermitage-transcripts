00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
So some people say that we only live once, so we must enjoy our lives to the fullest.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Do whatever makes us happy.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
Go after our desires, try to achieve what we want to achieve.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
We enjoy our lives to the fullest.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
That's the idea.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
That's okay.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Good late.

00:44.000 --> 00:59.000
Well, if you're an authentic person, I mean many people say that as a formal dismissal,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
are you only live once?

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
There's nothing you can say to them, but say people start doubting that notion of you only live once.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
The fact is you don't really know how many times you live.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
So as simple as that, you can't know.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
You cannot know.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
There are people who believe, they live only once.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
There are people who believe that you live many times.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
There are people who believe you live twice, such as rebirth in heaven or hell and that's it.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
But the point is, it's always going to remain a matter of belief.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
So if you're somebody who is trying to help yourself in an ultimate manner,

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
who want to develop your mind and so on, you have to recognize that and admit

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
that it's always going to be a matter of belief.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
So when you're sure, when you feel completely confident in saying you live only once,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
well, that's not true.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Because you don't know, for sure, yet you've been sure based upon a mere belief.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
It's a big mistake.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
It's a very risky thing to do.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
So I'm not saying you should stop believing whatever you believe.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm just saying you have to recognize that it is a belief and it cannot be more than that.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
So from that point of view, then you recognize, well, what is the safest belief I can have?

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Like, if I live only once, if I believe that, okay, sure.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
And then as a result of that belief, I end up behaving in this life whichever way I want.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
But what if you live more than once?

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
And then because of your bad behavior in this life, you end up paying the price.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Because those people who do believe in future lives, be Christians or Buddhist or Hindus,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
they believe that you're going to be able, accordingly, to your actions.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
Even Christians, like if you're not a good Christian, having those will be close to you.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.000
So you recognize that, okay, so the belief of more lives requires a certain degree of good behavior.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
In a sense, if you don't behave well, your future lives, they're going to be very compromised.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
So that's all you have to do. You don't have to go further and you have to look for a proof.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
You just have to recognize it. It's a belief.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
And as such, the best belief for you to adopt is the one that's safest in a long run.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
As with everything else in the life, you don't want to think just for tomorrow.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, I'll just steal this today. Enjoy the money.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
Enjoy the money I stole tomorrow, and then they have tomorrow going to go to jail for the rest of my life.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
That's a very unwise thing to do.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
So in the same manner, you recognize there might be only one life, there might be more lives.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
But I should assume that there are more lives in case that there are more lives,

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
and then I end up paying the price for my misbehavior in this life.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
And that's it. And it's not exactly that you need to relinquish this life in order to gain heaven in future lives.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
You just have to not behave like an animal in this life.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
That's it. You just have to have a degree of virtue.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
That's what everybody agrees upon.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
So what is the safest route for you to go?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
It's basically to believe that there are probably more lives just in case.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
If they're not so bad, you behave well in this life.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
People praise you. People you were trustworthy.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
They trusted you. They were never laid down, but you were not a scoundrel,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
not stealing, whatever cheating.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
So you behave properly, and you were rewarded right away with respect,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
and people wanted to help you.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
And then if there were, if there are future lives, you're going to be rewarded even more,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
according to those who believe in that.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
If not, well, so be it.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
And this whole thing like, I need to, people should do whatever makes them happy.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
Probably about three quarters of people don't really know what makes them happy.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
Which means for them, happiness is the experience when they're not experiencing unhappiness.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
Which means for them, pursuit of happiness is actively running away from the prospect of unhappiness.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
Which means your whole life revolves around running away from experiencing unpleasant feelings.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
That's your definition of happiness.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Being constant, being constantly chased by unhappiness and anxiety.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Exactly, exactly.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
And that's what definition of happiness becomes for people.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
And if you look at it, that's exactly how people live their lives.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
That's why there's so many issues in the modern society.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
People with mental problems developing them too much pressure, too much stress.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
They can't deal with it, medications, everything else,

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
vices, giving in to extreme measures, because you don't know what to do anymore.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
You're proliferated in that escape so much and took it at its face.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Well, you both took it as if it's sort of a good thing.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
How you just do whatever makes you happy.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
What makes me happy?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Well, I'm happy when I don't experience unhappiness.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
So then what must move?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I must prevent unhappiness and all cost.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And then you become very stressed.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
And then sensuality becomes the only mean of gaining some degree of happiness.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
But that's not happiness. That's just management of your unhappiness.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Which of course, from the point of view of that unhappiness, is happiness.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
But it's a very relative happiness.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
It's not really a happiness that can last.

06:24.000 --> 06:32.000
But a happiness that lasts is one way you don't have to maintain it.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Exactly.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, the happiness is the happiness in itself, which means it's happiness of freedom.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Happiness of being above things that can affect you.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Not kind of happiness of necessity.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Like, I need to keep running away because it's this beast chasing me.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
That's not happiness.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
You might feel a relief when you feel like, oh, you're temporarily safe from the beast.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
And there is happiness from the, obviously, the threat, the imminent threat of the beast attacking you.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
But overall, you're still not free from the beast, which means that's only a relative happiness.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
And that beast is basically any form of suffering in this life.

07:11.000 --> 07:20.000
Internal, external, any anxiety, fear, stress, burden, loss, any of that.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
It's basically an example of the beast you're running away from.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Because the mind is just at its face value.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
What it does when it experiences suffering, it turns away from it.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Wants to get rid of it.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Wants to prevent it.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
And then that becomes a definition of the purpose of your life, just running.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
And that's why people compulsively give in to the central desire.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It's not optional.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
There is no matter, oh, I will refrain from sensuality today, unless the circumstances refrain you.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
That's why it's not, it's almost mandatory for people to, why?

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Because they chose the path of running away.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
Which equals to say they chose the path of just taking their desires at the face value.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Which means they won't be able to resist them.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
And that's why you're bound.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
You're bound by the desire.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
You're bound by fear.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
You're bound by running away from suffering.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
So any happiness that you can experience is going to be within that.

08:26.000 --> 08:54.000
Which means it's a measly happiness.
