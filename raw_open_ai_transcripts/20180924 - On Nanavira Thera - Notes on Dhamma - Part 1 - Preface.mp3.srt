1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,720
Okay, so we thought of doing a short, or not so short, series on the Nyanavira Telestichis,

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,600
specifically on his notes and Dhamma book.

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,680
And Venera Paine Ratan is behind the camera, so he's going to ask some questions that are

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,280
usually what people ask us about Nyanavira, starting from preface and then going through

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,080
different notes of that book.

6
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:48,160
So also, if the viewers have any questions about Nyanavira teachings regarding this particular

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,720
series, they can ask in the comment section and then we can probably include it in some

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,320
future videos.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,040
So yeah, we're going to start with preface and then move onwards with other notes, especially

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,560
the ones that usually people have problems grasping them or understanding, or there's

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,120
some lack of clarity or something like that.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:17,480
So I'll start us off with just reading a section from the first paragraph of the preface.

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:26,120
He writes, there is therefore nothing in these pages to interest the professional scholar

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,280
for whom the question of personal existence does not arise, for the scholar's whole concern

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,000
is to eliminate or ignore the individual point of view in an effort to establish an objective

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
truth.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,080
It would be impersonal synthesis of public facts.

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,280
The scholar is essentially a horizontal few of things seeking connections in space and time

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,800
and his historical approach to the texts disqualify him, many possibility of understanding the

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,480
Dhamma that the Buddha himself has called Akalika, or timeless.

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,880
Only in a vertical view, straight down into the abyss of his personal existence is a man

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,360
capable of apprehending the perilous insecurity of his situation and only a man who does apprehend

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,640
this is prepared to listen to the Buddha's teaching.

24
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:21,160
So it can be a bit confusing about the idea of having two different kinds of thinking,

25
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,920
like what exactly it is that distinguishes a horizontal kind of thinking as he's saying

26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,360
versus a vertical kind of thinking.

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,560
Could you elaborate more on that?

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:42,200
Well in brief, the main difference is the vertical thinking is the thinking done through

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
your existence.

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,960
So you do that thinking arises on the basis, literally on the basis of anxiety, existential

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,200
dread, recognition of your human situation.

32
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,640
That's where the Buddha would often refer in the suttas as a young man would get disillusioned

33
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,600
with life and then he would ponder on human situation and he would recognize this human

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,280
life he's subject to suffering, you would pray to suffering, I mean suffering is this

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,440
invisible hunter that can pounce on you at any time and you can't do anything about it.

36
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,080
So the main, that's the prerequisite, that attitude is a prerequisite towards the existential

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,240
understanding and then towards the right practice of Dhamma.

38
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,800
So that's what Janiro is talking about, when you're not trying to overcome any particular

39
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,200
issue that you might have in your life, but really understanding the nature of a human

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,560
deal and not being satisfied with it.

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,040
So that's why you cannot approach practice correctly as a scholar or as somebody who

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:54,240
just merely collecting information about the Dhamma, but you really need to make it not

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,840
optional for yourself in order to be able to do it rightly.

44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,440
So that's what he meant because often people approach the suttas, approach the study mostly

45
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,480
for the scholarly value as in collecting the data, collecting information, drawing the

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:23,800
parallels in time and space and sort of rationalizing it, but not really approaching it on the

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:31,840
basis of that personal necessity of practice, in which case it's not optional anymore and

48
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,400
you really need to understand what the Buddha was teaching in order to be free from the

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,280
existential era.

50
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,600
So what is it about this vertical view that also made it the timeless view as opposed

51
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,520
to the horizontal one that's looking at connections and space time?

52
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:58,600
Well, as the Buddha said, the suffering has a presently arisen cause of craving, which

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,600
means that the freedom from suffering, freedom from possibility to suffer, which is suffering

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:12,360
in itself, is to be found in the present moment, but not in that kind of a contemporary mystified

55
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,520
notion of just being the present, but in understanding that pertains to the present

56
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,600
moment as in understanding the cause of that suffering that's here presently, simultaneously

57
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,640
arisen with that suffering.

58
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,920
So that is, that's what Nyanavir Atera described as a vertical view into your own being as

59
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,880
opposed to that horizontal view of you assuming or rationalizing before and after and in between

60
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,760
and left or right, not seeing present there isn't suffering simultaneously through that

61
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,240
you see present there isn't craving.

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,480
And you know that with the absence of that craving, suffering cannot stand even for a

63
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,200
second longer.

64
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,980
And that's why to be known individually, as in vertically, personally, by the wise,

65
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,560
dhamma that's timeless in that sense, it does not involve a passage of time, that direct

66
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
insight doesn't involve it.

67
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,160
People in the modern day like neuroscientists and psychologists and stuff, they also try

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,040
and study suffering, study, maybe apply their fields to the Buddha's teaching.

69
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,520
Are they using that vertical view or are they divorced from that in some way?

70
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:34,680
Well, they're divorced from that long time ago, when they sort of gave the unquestioned

71
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:42,720
validity to the scientific method, because science in itself negates the observer.

72
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,960
But certainly that's the starting premise.

73
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,080
Later on they might try to factor in the observer, but only through that scientifically assumed

74
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,760
external public world of matter, and then you try to re-include the observer, but you fail

75
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,280
to see that the observer was the one who was first.

76
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,040
He was the one who decided to look for these particular things and develop science out

77
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,480
of it, which means you can't use them that science to explain the tools of your perception

78
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,080
of your feeling, of your point of view, that as an observer you're inseparable from.

79
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,920
Yet that whole domain, that whole sphere, disappears in science, and when it's included,

80
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,040
it's included as a second best.

81
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,080
So then when a modern science talks about Buddhism, as if they're proving the Buddha's

82
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,080
teaching to be right, they've completely misunderstood it to begin with.

83
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,560
Because if the scientists were truly understanding that the Buddha was right, they would have

84
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,880
been at least, they would become at least the Sotopanna through their science, probably

85
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,480
Arrahants as well.

86
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
But they're not.

87
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,120
They're not free from sensuality, greed, aversion, delusion, wrong view, which means

88
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,320
when they say this is what the Buddha meant, they don't know what the Buddha meant, because

89
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,920
only when nobody's short in a Sotopanna knows what the Buddha meant correctly.

90
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,280
And that's one of the things that Venerina Luitero is always insistent upon, which is

91
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,560
a good thing to insist on, because you might be unpleasant to admit to yourself, especially

92
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,120
if you invested years of practice, but ultimately it can actually spur you further, because

93
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,960
you don't make a compromise thinking to know that which you don't, and you keep striving

94
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,760
until you reach that clarity of knowledge, which is necessary for any correct practice

95
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
of Dhamma.

96
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:39,160
Okay, I'll start reading now.

97
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:48,880
So going for the next part to page 12 of the Roman numeral 12 of the preface, it starts

98
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,880
existential philosophies then insist upon asking questions about self and the world,

99
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,640
taking care at the same time to insist that they're unanswerable.

100
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Beyond this point of frustration, these philosophies cannot go.

101
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,440
The Buddha too insists that questions about the self and the world are unanswerable, either

102
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,080
by refusing to answer them, or by indicating that no statement about the self and the world

103
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
can be justified.

104
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,920
But, and here is the vital difference, the Buddha can and does go beyond this point, not

105
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,560
to be sure by answering the unanswerable, but by showing the way leading to the final

106
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,360
cessation of all questions about the self and the world.

107
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,640
So one issue that we can sometimes have when we're trying to start reading Nenevere is

108
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:46,080
it all sounds so very like kind of lofty and philosophical, you know, talking about existential

109
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
ambiguity.

110
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,680
For some, for some people it may be hard to see the connection between this vague existential

111
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,200
problem and just, you know, the suffering I have when things don't go my way, for example.

112
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Could you, so could you talk about how suffering all does kind of come to be rooted fundamentally

113
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,040
in this, this problem?

114
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,600
The problem of existence.

115
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Yeah.

116
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,800
Well, the reason why Nenevere approached it through the existential philosophy is because

117
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:29,040
he himself read quite a lot of it, because he wasn't existential philosophy, likes of

118
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,680
Slak-Sartre, Heidegger, well, even Kierkegaard is considered to be part of that.

119
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,000
It's not really a philosophy in a sense of a system of a thought that you develop and

120
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,680
again rationalize or idealize, but it's really in its root, obviously some of those philosophers

121
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,960
have went further afterwards, but initially the whole point of existential philosophy

122
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:58,520
was to found to be like a descriptive method of the phenomenological insight, and saying

123
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:06,880
phenomenological insight, nothing other than saying mindful discernment.

124
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,040
And that's why that philosophy was useful for a European thought, because most of the

125
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,440
other philosophies were pretending to forget the existence of the subject as a priority

126
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,040
as they would say existence precedes the essence.

127
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,160
And then the whole descriptive method developed around just seeing what's present there, not

128
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,600
developing conclusions based upon it.

129
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,840
So that's when Nenevere picked that up as a starting point for the protugena, because

130
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,600
that's the most you can get as a protugena to clarify the issue of your situation as

131
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:44,000
highly get described in the heart of every human situation is a concern, it's fundamentally

132
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,840
rooted upon concern, that's the most primordial aspect of human being, concern.

133
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,240
And that's nothing other than Dukkha in itself, you're not specifically concerned about this

134
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,440
or that, just a general, vague and biguous uneasiness, lack of ease, and that's what

135
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Dukkha means, means an absence of ease.

136
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,960
So that's why that he would use existential philosophy to relate to the reader, because

137
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,440
that was his background obviously.

138
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,720
And also because it would require the person who has it to have some sort of, well at least

139
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,440
a degree of that self awareness of their own existence, which means they won't be coming

140
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:40,280
from some mystical point of view, some devotional inspiration and wanting to have the ecstasies

141
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,520
of meditation, like how they used to translate the Jhanas and so on.

142
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,960
So many people still have those, the residues of those notions as some sort of some transcendental

143
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,280
projection through the Buddhist practice in some new astral realm of arahanship and similar,

144
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,080
but it isn't, it's just freeing you from yourself, literally.

145
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,780
Hitting you from greed, aversion, delusion, framing you from unwholesome, that's what

146
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,440
Nibana is.

147
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,080
So in that sense, by opting to not sort of border down the instruction, he kind of sieved

148
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,760
out many people who would have just casually arrived at it and misunderstood it, it's

149
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,600
no doubt about it.

150
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,640
So that was his approach, but obviously, there was his approach, it can be different approaches,

151
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,680
but what cannot be different is the necessity of that existential concern.

152
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,600
As the Buddha said, a young man recognizes that he's prey to suffering, that's exactly

153
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,400
a description of the entire existential philosophy contained just in that one line in the suttas.

154
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,240
Imagine how would you feel if you go about every day of your life feeling your prey to

155
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,880
a hunter that you don't know where it is, who it is, and when it's going to pass.

156
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,520
You will feel very uneasy, and that is the definition of a human situation.

157
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:58,640
So that's why people use sensuality, distraction, even anger, all the worldly projects to destroy

158
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,240
themselves from the basic insecurity of the situation.

159
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,040
So that's how it relates to that practice.

160
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:17,440
So it sounds like it's what's more primordial than is not so much always when things do

161
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,560
not go one's way, but the fact that maybe they could, that these philosophers were pointing

162
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,960
at and Nyanavira was pointing at.

163
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,640
They could go wrong, not necessarily that it does go wrong, you don't need to wait

164
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,200
for it to go wrong, because sometimes by that time it might be too late.

165
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,040
You want to recognize that it could go wrong, that it might go wrong, and then of course

166
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,320
as the Buddha went step further and says well eventually it will go wrong, sickness, aging

167
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
and death.

168
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,320
But those are the ultimate examples of the human situation that can go wrong at any time.

169
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,880
So that's why that Dukka is not like intense, acute suffering, like you're being tortured,

170
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,520
tormented by something.

171
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,960
It's the recognition of the possibility of being affected by suffering, and you wouldn't

172
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,080
be able to do anything about it.

173
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,840
And that in itself it's a cause for concern, and concern in itself is an unpleasant feeling.

174
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,200
Thus Dukka is translated as the most general of suffering.

175
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,440
So you've mentioned that Nyanavira borrowed heavily from an existential, phenomenological

176
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,360
approach to his understanding of the Buddha's teaching.

177
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,760
Do you think it's important or necessary for a person who's trying to understand the Dhamma

178
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,800
themselves to become familiar, like start reading Sator and Heidegger and things like

179
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
that?

180
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:51,480
You haven't been reading it, no, no, even probably a result in wasting more time.

181
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,960
If they're already familiar, yeah it can be helpful.

182
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,560
But as I said, Nyanavira was referring to that, to those descriptions, to that terminology

183
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,760
of existential phenomenology, because, well because people who ordered them to suit it

184
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,800
could relate with greater clarity as it gives them a better starting point.

185
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,240
So it was just efficient way, but it's not, you know, it is, as I said, either you approach

186
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,960
it in that manner or in some other manner, one thing that a person must have is that existential

187
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,920
concern, recognition of its own existential human situation.

188
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:35,040
So if a person is aware of that and approaching Dhamma for that purpose, then they don't need

189
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,400
to go through the existential philosophy.

190
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:43,880
They just need to, well, become mindful of the feeling, the phenomenon of feeling, and

191
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,200
mindful of the possibility of things that they might feel while they're alive, as in

192
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,720
become mindful of the possibility of suffering.

193
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,240
One thing that a person reading through the notes can start asking is, you know, all these

194
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,320
descriptions of various terms we find in the suitors are great, they really make sense,

195
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:13,600
they're really clarifying, but how do I start practicing, meditating, and things like that?

196
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,200
The suit is so general, because it's been a long time ago, and the way of that oral

197
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,160
transmission means now they're very condensed in meaning and very general in instruction,

198
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,640
which means people can come from literally diametrically opposing angles and read the

199
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,440
same suits differently.

200
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,480
And you can't help that, because the Buddha is not alive anymore, as nobody there comes

201
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,360
from that time to point you in the right direction as to how to read, that's why it is necessary

202
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,200
to start with that existential attitude and self-awareness, because of that you won't

203
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,400
be able to go too wrong in your misreading of the suitors, which inevitably everybody

204
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,920
starts by misreading them.

205
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,440
And then you realize, yeah, you can interpret it like this, you can interpret it like this,

206
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,040
you can interpret it like this, but which one of those ways that you can interpret it really

207
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:14,880
pertains to that existential suffering, that becomes your criteria for practice.

208
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,000
So that's why it's important to develop, which is quite unpleasant, often results in

209
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,120
anxiety and sense of dread, because otherwise a person would be sort of overly committing

210
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,840
to a view, and then they would be reading the suitors from that point of view and then

211
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,520
defending it and so on, and not really applying it to that existential basis.

212
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,680
And is there a, I guess I was trying to ask, is there like a specific method or technique

213
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,720
by which one does apply it to that place?

214
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Most certainly not.

215
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Now, if it were, the Buddha would have spoke about it, and the closest to method or technique

216
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,760
is what the suitors tell us, develop very strange by the precepts, see the danger in

217
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:05,520
the slightest fault, be moderating eating, spend your days being mindful and wakeful.

218
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,120
As in, don't give in to distraction, don't give in to careless thoughts, that would in

219
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,880
itself result in calmness, tranquility, that can then result in seeing things clearly and

220
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,480
knowing exactly what you need to abandon, as in the unwholesome thoughts.

221
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,600
Those are routine, greedy version, delusion, they are routine, distraction, and desire

222
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,320
and craving.

223
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,200
But yeah, there is a tendency, obviously, that what I mean, a person, if a person does

224
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:40,000
not have that individual, personal, vertical criteria of existential angst and suffering

225
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and possibility to suffer, it will be easy then to just give in to a promise method or

226
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,840
a mechanical technique, they can then result.

227
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:55,400
Well, you hope to result in liberation, but really, the only way you can liberate yourself

228
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,600
is to come to grips with your own existence, Baba, and see that you are responsible for

229
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,560
upholding it and then undo it.

230
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,200
That's why when the narrator was often talking about undoing things.

231
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:17,160
So the closest method that can result in understanding that you can come is to say you have to keep

232
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,880
trying to understand.

233
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
That's it.

234
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,880
I can't tell you do this to this to this to this and then that will automatically result

235
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,040
in understanding, because understanding is when you understood, based on the given data

236
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
and information.

237
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,560
So you inform yourself, through Naira, through the suttas and using the personal criteria

238
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,600
of being liable to suffering, because if you understood things correctly, that liability

239
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,800
to suffering should be diminishing and you will see directly.

240
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,680
That's why Sotapana, somebody who has reached that first stage, knows exactly what suffering

241
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,960
is, what origin of suffering is, what cessation is, and what to do to develop that cessation.

242
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
He's not guessing anymore.

243
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,880
He has a direct knowledge into that.

244
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:06,840
So to reiterate then, for one who's trying to develop this proper attitude and is trying

245
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:16,040
to undertake a study of the suttas and the notes on Dhamma, what is then the proper place

246
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,000
of these notes in that pursuit?

247
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:31,800
Well, the notes are sort of, well first of all, they need to live restrained by the precepts.

248
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,400
Depending on how far they want to go in their understanding, either fiber, but ideally eight

249
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,640
precepts, which means whether you are reading the notes or reading the suttas, if you don't

250
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,960
have the basic virtue being developed, maintained through your practice of mindfulness and samadhi

251
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,080
that comes out of it, no amount of understanding will take place.

252
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,680
It will all be in the abstract scholastic theory.

253
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:01,680
So the place of notes is for somebody who does live restrained and wants the work laid out

254
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,880
for them, as in what needs to be understood.

255
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,160
Some people can handle more of it, some people less, but the point is you do need to understand

256
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,880
at least a degree of the Buddhist teaching.

257
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,920
So the notes could help you develop that right attitude towards the suttas, how to read them.

258
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,480
Whether you would read them just as an Indian folklore, a social commentary of the times,

259
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,240
a loose compilation of the Buddhist utterances, or you're going to read them as the strictest,

260
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:37,840
condensed, and most universal, as in general, phenomenological description of your experience.

261
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,320
Because if you start reading them like that with that attitude, you realize, yeah, all

262
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,720
it takes is to understand fully one sutta and you can be another hunter to encounter it.

263
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,600
If you approach them as a folklore, then you can have it all, makes no difference.

264
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,320
But if you approach them actually as a direct description of something that universally present

265
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,960
in every human experience, it means then that you need to see it in order to understand

266
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,920
that sutta.

267
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,880
So that was one of the examples that really kind of, I didn't realize that, because when

268
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,080
I was a layman, I was reading the suttas and I found them useful, but I didn't quite

269
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,760
understand, well, their extent, their importance, until I came across in a era who, but by that

270
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,880
time I was reading lots of sattra, hide the gear, and other philosophy, being in time,

271
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
being in nothingness.

272
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,120
So I could read philosophy and I had no trouble following it, and I was quite familiar with

273
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
it.

274
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,520
So there was one bit when Janavira mentioned he gives this entire quote from sattra, or

275
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,640
hide the gear, maybe, the entire page, about a human situation and so on, about the senses

276
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,160
and sense perception.

277
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,760
And I remember I read that quote many times, so he felt like, oh, yeah, this is very useful.

278
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,000
And then he says, or for example, as the Buddha would say, so he compares what this like

279
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,200
pages of this philosophy said, compares, and he was just like one line from the suttas.

280
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,800
Then I read many times, but he never occurred to me to read it in such a heavily condensed

281
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,640
manner, to give it that kind of importance.

282
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,560
But then I realized, well, actually, I should be giving it that kind of importance, because

283
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,920
that's how people at the end of a discourse, discourse by the Buddha, would have become

284
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,680
utterance, or at least sotupanas, and then we read it today, we wonder why there's nothing

285
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,840
happening to me, because you're not reading it rightly.

286
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,880
If you approach every single line to be condensed with meaning, not in that scholastic sort

287
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,960
of investigation of the information and connections with other passages and so on, but genuinely

288
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,640
just what it actually is, what is describing it phenomenologically, what is being described

289
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,680
by it, phenomenologically, as in presently right here, right now.

290
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,320
And if you approach it like that, then you realize, yeah, one sutta, fully understood,

291
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,840
can certainly result in the right view.

292
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,280
As I just gave the example, like when the Buddha, I mean, many of us, would have just

293
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:01,640
read over that line when the Buddha says, a young man feels he's prey to suffering, subject

294
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,280
to suffering, so he goes forth into homeless life.

295
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.

296
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,960
But if you stop and think about it, just that, just those two words, three words, prey to

297
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,920
suffering, contains the entire existential philosophy, volumes and volumes of work, centuries of

298
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,160
phenomenological development, it's all in that attitude.

299
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,960
That's all the existential philosophy concern about, experiencing concern in regard to the

300
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,440
basic nature of your existence, yet the Buddha just included in the first line of every other

301
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,160
sutta.

302
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,480
But then you realize, hold on.

303
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,280
So if I read the rest of this sutta, I have to have that attitude then, because he would

304
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,080
go further, that man who would feel he's prey to suffering, goes into homeless life, finds

305
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,120
a teaching, applies himself, and then becomes another.

306
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
But that's what I mean.

307
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,480
So you can, you can say, no, it was just a social commentary, and you can't debate that

308
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,400
because there is no proof in between or a living person who can say, no, you're right, you're

309
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
wrong.

310
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,000
But then you ask yourself, well, why do you practice?

311
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,600
Is it because some sort of cultural enrichment or gathering data or scholastic development

312
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,520
or is it for freedom from suffering?

313
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,600
Then you recognize that, well, scholastic understanding, social understanding, no matter how vast the

314
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,480
net of your connection develops, does not free you from suffering.

315
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,880
But phenomenological understanding, the present there isn't cause of the present there isn't

316
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,640
suffering does free you from.

317
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:32,120
And then you can decide yourself how you want to read the sutta.

318
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:40,680
One set of terms that comes up fairly often is a positive and negative.

319
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:48,960
There's footnote letter N, which describes a brief quote from Soren Kierkegaard regarding

320
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,360
the negative thinking, says, precisely because the negative is present in existence and present

321
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,240
everywhere for existence is a constant process of becoming, it is necessary to become aware

322
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,760
of its presence continuously as you only safeguard against it.

323
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,240
Janavir writes, positive or abstract thinking abstracts from existence and is thus incapable

324
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,280
of thinking continuously.

325
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,880
So it's not, it may not be clear to many people what exactly, what is a negative and a positive

326
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,760
kind of thinking, like those domains may not mean anything to some people.

327
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:33,160
In simple terms, a negative thinker is a thinker who is aware of his own situation while thinking.

328
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,440
He doesn't abstract the content of his thoughts from the situation, which is why it's called

329
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
abstraction.

330
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,520
So he remains aware of the background that the necessary basis for his whatever engagement

331
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,920
might be.

332
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,160
So that's why the negative thinker is in that it's negative in relation to the positive

333
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,320
content of his particular thought.

334
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,080
So he's kind of like aware of the background of his act of thinking or speaking or doing

335
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,400
things by body, aware of the peripheral.

336
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,240
That's exactly where in the sutta, that's exactly where the development of mind comes

337
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,440
down to, practice of samadhi, practice of jhanas, developing the sphere of that peripheral and

338
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:21,960
thus overcoming the particular domains of sensuality, ill will and so on.

339
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:30,200
So then when one is trying to understand these notes, is it that negative kind of thinking

340
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,800
through which they have to be understood as opposed to the positive thinking that one

341
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
may be used to?

342
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,440
Well, it's not something you can, negative thinking, not something you can jump into

343
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
by choice.

344
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,320
So it needs to be developed.

345
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,760
So by trying to understand what negative thinking is, what the negative thinker is,

346
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,520
that's how you begin to develop it.

347
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
So that's what I mean.

348
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,760
If you approach it just through like a positive comparison and scholastic study and so on,

349
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,800
you're not going to understand the notes.

350
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,680
But if you approach it because you want solution to the existential problem of liability to

351
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:08,240
suffering, then you will start to understand that because you will be reading them increasingly

352
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,000
more rightly, so to speak.

353
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,200
And that's what I mean, the virtue, the restraint, the sensory strength and the establishment

354
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,400
of virtue and the precepts needs, it's not negotiable, needs to come first and needs

355
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,320
to be maintained beforehand as well.

356
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,200
Which means then you took it on as your lifestyle.

357
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,800
The whole approach to them are not just something you might do on the weekend or occasionally

358
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
on an online floor.

359
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,600
At the end of the preface he talks about this fundamental structure, which is at the back

360
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,480
of the notes on Dhamma.

361
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,440
A lot of people have many questions and are very interested in mathematical appearance.

362
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,080
Do you think that's something that's important for understanding the Buddhist teaching?

363
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,280
No, absolutely not.

364
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,760
As the animator Thérrez himself said, it's just an instrument of thought that he himself

365
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:09,280
found very useful, but you can't really think fundamental structure in phenomenological terms.

366
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,320
Because you are the structure, your experience, the pancha, pancha, pancha, but I can't,

367
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,880
the five aggregates, is your experience.

368
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,720
So what he deals there with, he deals with the description of the structure, which would

369
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,880
require you to have an external view to it, which you can't.

370
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,760
So in order to describe it, you must give up the phenomenological method.

371
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,760
If you give a phenomenological method, you're not talking about existence anymore.

372
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,000
That's what he felt it as an instrument, as a justification for reflexive thinking and

373
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,560
so on, as an explanation for it.

374
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:49,560
But in terms of somebody needing to understand it, or something, it's not necessarily completely.

375
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:55,920
Because also, you cannot factor in that structure, which is the problem of science as well.

376
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,480
They meet the same problem, which is when you assume the external point of view to your

377
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,640
experience, you can't factor in the feeling, the domain of feeling.

378
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,840
I mean, you can represent it on the paper, but that's not being felt right there and

379
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
then.

380
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,720
So in that sense, feeling is always present, but you remember the past feeling, the future

381
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,560
feeling, the present feeling, you feel it presently.

382
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,920
Hence the Buddha said, my teachings for the one who feels, who knows how to feel.

383
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,320
So that's why I wouldn't, unless you already have a starting point that allows you to relate

384
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,760
to fundamental structure and kind of just enrich the instrument of your thinking, that's fine.

385
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,320
But otherwise, you'd be just wasting time.

386
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,240
I think he included it because it is quite unique.

387
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,680
And for somebody who was in philosophy and phenomenology, yeah, it's a very interesting

388
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,680
and useful thing in that semi-scholastic semi-phenomenological sense.
