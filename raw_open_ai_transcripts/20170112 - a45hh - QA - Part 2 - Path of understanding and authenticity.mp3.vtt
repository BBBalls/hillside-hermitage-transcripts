00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
But can you explain the practice of samadhai, the basanam?

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
Sure. Well, you can start by sort of applying a blanket.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Or maybe I just, I will start with some idea which I do.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Okay, so yeah, you can do that.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
So it was after you know talking with you about this phenomenological approach,

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
in the pafero, I was still considering that actually to practice just simple,

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
and upon a meditation as I used to do it, you know, just relax,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
staying in the present is your briefing.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
It's actually still a good thing to do in your spare time.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
But seems that you have something to say about it.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
I think what I say is that, yeah, yeah, well basically most,

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
more often than not, it won't be a good thing because you won't do it mindfully.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Like if you go into an object of meditation, whatever that might be,

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
and if you want to do it just to sort of calm down and well not,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
yeah, you can do it, but on the basis of mindfulness.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
And the basis of mindfulness as we've been discussing all these previous talks

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
is the basis of the awareness of the paerifero.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
So as I said yesterday, sure, you can't possibly sustain,

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
although you could, surprise yourself,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
but your amount of energy you can invest in sort of repetition of this discernment

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
of the paerifero in regard to actual and actual in regard to paerifero

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
so that you fully sort of keep drilling that in,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
training and drilling and training and drilling.

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
So, but say you're tired of it, so then yes, you stop actively pursuing the discernment of that principle,

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
but you don't then turn completely away and then become unmindful,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
become unaware of the principle.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Because that means you're not mindful.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
That means when you go to meditate, if you meditate without being aware of the principle,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
you meditate without mindfulness, which means that's not meditation at all.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
But it can be still awesome activity.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
You know, you are not engaged.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Well, I'm sure desire is between something unholy, something...

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, it's also in a very relative manner.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
It's awesome because only because you don't engage in sensual desire.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
But it remains very much on wholesome,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
because you won't take you out of the putugena status.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Nor will it take you out of the wrong view.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
On the contrary, it will probably keep perpetuating the wrong view.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That's why the Buddha said those meditators,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
summoners and Brahmins without the right view,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
they end up meditating...

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
They think they meditate by the end of premeditating,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
overmeditating, mismeditating, undermeditating,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
and all of those kind of permutations.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Because why?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
The mind is still bound with sensuality,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
with the notions of self, with all the wrong assumptions,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
and they meditate with that.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
So a putugena cannot meditate with a pure mind,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
because he doesn't have such a thing.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
He doesn't even have a concept of what phenomenon of the mind is.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
But he could purify his mind by practicing jhanas.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Yes, and jhanas are nothing other,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
than fully established upon the principle of mindfulness,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
which is the principle we've been discussing,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
which I think maybe was even recorded.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I explained to you that extending the same awareness

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
of the peripheral legato,

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
you can go as far as to their casinos.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
The four great elements,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
the element of consciousness,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
which is the most refined one,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
told the jhanas to the immaterial,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
and mindful establishments.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
It's the extending the mind along the same principle.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
That's why the sari puting, one by one,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
that's the imaginary kaya,

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
goes to the first jhana,

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
and then he kind of,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
oh, the recognize the factors that are there,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
and says this is all kind of being held by mindfulness,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
and then he's there beyond,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
and then following the same principle says,

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
yeah, there is beyond.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
So then he goes, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
until obviously with his right view,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
he reaches to the cessation of perception and feeling,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
which is obviously that there is not beyond that,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
when things cease.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
But that's just to see how far this great structure,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
kind of structures itself,

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
is there beyond this?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes,

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
up to the infinite space,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
the infinite consciousness,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
now the perception and not perception.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
All those things in the regard to mind

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
being developed in regard to the peripheral,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
because when you're able to sort of reach,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
and it's not like it's abstract now,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
because the mind is not developed,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
but for the developed mind,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
reaching the verges of the phenomenon of space,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
goes into the infinite space.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
The verges of the perception,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
surmounting the perceptions of unity and diversity,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
doesn't matter in particular,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
general nature of perceptions,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
surmounted, you reach a base of neither perception

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
nor perception.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
So Janus, that's why the good phrase is Janus,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
because even, sure,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
you don't need necessarily the right view,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
but in order to do them,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
you're doing them along the right view,

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
along the right principle,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
along the principle of partition part,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
along the principles of semantics,

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
sensuality, semantics,

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
the master, I am of the experience,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
many sort of say that,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I am cannot be present in the Janus,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
it ceases beforehand,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
that's where the monetized Janus and so on.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So that's why the good phrase is that,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
because if you were to develop Janus as protagonists,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
then you would need very, very little instruction

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
to put it all together

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
and become probably not right away,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
because the mind is already developed

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
to such an extent

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
that has amounted the domain of sensuality,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
has fully understood the nature of Salatina,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
and it's impermanent and so on.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
So it's very important to recognize that,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
the tutuja cannot meditate rightly,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
unless he is a sotpan.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh, that's a strong statement.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, well, you don't need to go further

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
than some of it is so fancy,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
that right view makes everything right.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Yes.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, so it's not my statement,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
it's the whole suit about it.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
So how can you meditate rightly if you have no review?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
And the story.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
But it can mean it without you knowing

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
that you are meditating rightly,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
you just meditate and prepare your mind

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
for a crying effect.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, if you don't know it,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
well, if right view is about the knowledge,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
if liberation is about the knowledge,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
how can you be knowing while not knowing?

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
How can you be doing it rightly while not knowing?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
If you are not knowing all the instructions of good heart.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, the one who understands those instructions

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
is the sotapana.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Nobody shortens in that,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
which means you follow something you haven't understood.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So how can you follow it?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
If I give you instruction and you make no sense out of it,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
how can you perform it?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Because you just follow instructions.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Well, no, it means some task to do

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
and I don't understand.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Exactly, I just say you won't do the task rightly.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
If the task is based upon you understanding the task,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
like the Buddha didn't say,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
just perform these mechanical things

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
and you get to the final result.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
He said, understand what I'm teaching you,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
and then you will be your own kind of leader,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
your own sort of guide to the final task.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So what you are sort of talking about

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
would be as if the Buddha gave this in person,

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
in person, sort of set of methods and instructions

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
that you can just stick to it and you will arrive at it.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
But he didn't.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
He did give instructions that need to be understood.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Hence the right view comes first.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
And he said himself,

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
in Samadhi Sutra,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
why some samadhi right?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
It's because of the right view.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
So without the right view,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
you cannot meditate rightly.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
But on the other hand,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I have no say but but but.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
But on the other hand,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
we have quite a few examples of people

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
who had Janas,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
and there is the Buddha Janas.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, that's what I said.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
So theoretically, as putugana,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
you can develop Janas.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
You can develop the full understanding of this principle

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
and develop your mind.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
And not necessarily,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
until somebody tells you externally,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
turn that to the nature of the sense of self.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
That's why putugana can be free

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
from all the other rupadanas,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
except the rupadana of the self.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
There is a sutra,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
but I think it's Imaginika,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
or maybe Angutra.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Not sure.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
But putugana can be free from sensuality,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
can be free from silabat paramasa.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
He cannot be free

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
from the self-view.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Because for that,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
you need utterance of another.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I see.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
But he will have very much of Ayurveda,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Manasikara,

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
if he had Janas.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
That's why, like say Janas,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
they are the four Janas,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
but then you have even,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
kind of, more refined immaterial attainments.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
That's why when the Buddha became the Buddha,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
when the Brahma pleaded to him to go and teach,

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
he generated,

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
who should I teach?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So there are putuganas,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
but which ones had the least dust in their eyes?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So he turned to his previous teacher,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
not out of some traditional gratitude,

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
or anything like that.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
No, because he had the least dust in his eyes,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
he was the basis of neither perception

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
or perception.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
So you realize,

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
as a putugana,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
he was really, really,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
he had done 99.9% of work

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
that Arahana needs to do.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
All he needed is just that

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
1, 0.1% to set everything right.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
He already had.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
So when they told him,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
the day was told him he died,

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
he said, why,

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
it's a really great loss for him.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
I mean,

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
unimaginable loss,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
because he actually was so, so close

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
to this very thing.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Then he went down the next one,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
which is the base of infinite space,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
wherever it was,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
all for the purpose,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
because they had

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
did done all the work mostly.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
And that's why when they do have people in the suit

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
as they heard,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
just one line from the Buddha

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
and became Arahana,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
it's because they've done all the work,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
rightly.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
So they developed the whole understanding

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
that resulted in the whole freedom of

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Upadana and everything.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
They just needed the last drop.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
So they did a lot of right understanding.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Really?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Yes, of course.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Well,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Buddha comes to you and tells you

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
in seeing, let there be the scene,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
in herd, let there only be the herd.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And you understand that, right there and then.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
You won't be able to understand that

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
if you have many wrong views blocking it,

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
covering it up.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
But if you clear all the wrong views,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
but you're not still quite there yet,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
and then somebody tells you that,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
and you understand it as clear as a day,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
as they tell to you.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
You can only do that if the mind is able to

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
sort of reach it at that level.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
And it can reach it at that level,

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
if it made the right effort.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
That's why again,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
you should keep trying to meditate

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
and keep trying to sort of understand

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
along the lines of understanding,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
not along the lines of mechanical technique

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
that you hope is purifying your mind

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
somewhere down the line.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Because even if we were,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
you have no right criteria.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You don't have right view to recognize

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
what the actual purity is.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
So even if it sits in your face,

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
you won't recognize it.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
It seems that I can't agree with this statement

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
that last one you said about.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I will show you my other thing,

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
which I used to,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
or which I have.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I was thinking that you purify your mind

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
so never enough,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
and by purifying your mind

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
so never enough,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
you will remove your obstacles.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And then you can,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
well,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
sure, that's not wrong statement to make,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
but purifying your mind

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
of never enough is done

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
by understanding what never enough is.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
But fully understanding the nature,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
you're surmounted.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
That's why Mahamogalana entered the first jhana

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
by understanding what the first jhana was.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Not by doing this or that.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Or going on a retreat,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
or watching souls of his feet.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
By understanding the nature of the first jhana,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
he entered the first jhana.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
So can he say that actually overcoming,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
you overcoming by understanding what nivarana is,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
means that you don't overcome them by technique,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
by just practicing some meditation.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Exactly.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Exactly.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
You overcome by understanding them.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
That's how the mind develops in regard to it.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
And understanding can take place only on the basis

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
of principle of the Titsamapara,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
the basis of principle of understanding

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
that a reason phenomena as it has a reason,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
which means on the basis of mindfulness,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
which means on the basis of

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
discerning peripheral in regard to the actual,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
or actually in regard to peripheral.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Because nivaranas are also phenomena

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
that are manifested in your visit experience as a whole.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
So if you understand it there,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
on the basis of the experience as a whole,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
you remove the ownership of it.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
You remove sort of their influence over you,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
but not only in them.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yes.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Because you give them power by taking possession of them.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
Or I'm involved about sotapana

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
and then separately in regard to nivaranas.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
To an extent.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
To an extent.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
So you have understood it.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
But as I said before,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
even with this principle that you can kind of understand,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
you still didn't fully understand it, didn't you?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Because you haven't repeated it long enough.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
So that's why an Arya,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
who is still not an Arhan,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
still has work to do.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
He still needs to keep re-engaging

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
in repeating of the same principle of the same understanding

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
that he has, which is why nobody else can be his guide,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
not even Buddha.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
He himself.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Because he got a criteria.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
He got a principle.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
He got a base for it.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
He got an understanding.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
He just needs to keep drilling it.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So just keep drilling it.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Exactly.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
That's why the Buddha we passed see before he became

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
some of some Buddha.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
He discerned,

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
but it's some part.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And in that deepening kaisuta,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
he disclosed,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
but it's some part.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
And he comes to the point of

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Nama Rupa, the term is Vinyana,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
and Vinyana, the term is Nama Rupa.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
And then he doesn't define,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
but it's some part of further.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
And then he says,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
but understanding that,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
he remained contemplating

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
manifestation,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I arising and ceasing of the five degrees,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
of the experience as a whole,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
until his mind was purified

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
from all of the kilesas,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and he became some of some Buddha.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
So if you understood the principle,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
then just remain drilling it.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
And it doesn't say,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
he remained drilling,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
but it's an opada.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
It says,

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
he understood,

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
but it's an opada.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Nama Rupa Vinyana Vinyana,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
and then he remained just

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
mindful of arising and falling

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
of the five arguments.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yes.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Of the enduring of the five arguments,

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
of persisting, of changing,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
of the five arguments,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
being independent of any

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
sort of notion of mind

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
and myself,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
he fully drilled that

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
to the extent necessary

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
for the final knowledge

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
and then a second,

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
he was done.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
So can we say that,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
or basically the essence,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
the point is to

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
understand that structure

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
of experience,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
and then understanding,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
that's the point.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
That's why, like,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I mean,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
it's kind of unfortunate

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
that this needs to be said,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
not like to be particular

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
about any generally,

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
because yeah,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
many people,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
when you read so much in every

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
certain, just like,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
the final knowledge,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
the final knowledge,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
the final understanding,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Puthujana can relate

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
to knowledge.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Just think about the phenomenon

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
of knowledge,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
means when you know something.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
So then, you must not

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
abandon that notion of knowledge,

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
when you're pursuing

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
the way out of suffering.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
As appealing as it is

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
to giving to an impersonal

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
mechanical technique

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
that sort of numbs you out

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
for a while,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
makes it very peaceful,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
it's a very, very dangerous path

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
to take, because you become

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
dependent upon it,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
in that pleasure,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
that forgetfulness,

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
that oblivion.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
So initially,

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
everything seems painful

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
because you want to know

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
everything, but you can't,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
but it's on the basis of that,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
that you can actually

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
be certain important

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
from unimportant,

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
which is an

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
description for Puthujana.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Like, I,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
what's important knowledge,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
what it isn't.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
But it's still,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
sorry,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
but it still is the knowledge.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
So,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
to answer your original question

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
about Samatha and Vipassana,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Vipassana is actively

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
pursuing the discernment

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
of those principles,

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
whatever approach you take,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
the five aggregates

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
from Puthujana

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
or the referral and actual,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
anything that's based

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
on mindfulness,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
that's where you can

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
not have too much of mindfulness

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
and that's where mindfulness

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
is always first,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
basically,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
in whatever list they come up.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
So, Vipassana will be actively

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
pursuing the discernment

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
while Samatha will be

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
not actively pursuing

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
the discernment

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
containing the basis

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
for discernment.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
So, if you maintain the

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
basis for discernment,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
but not exerting yourself

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
in understanding,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
you will progress a bit slower

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
in terms of understanding,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
but nevertheless,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
you eventually start seeing those things,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
why? Because you know

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
where you're supposed to see,

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
and you keep holding it

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
in front of you.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Even if you're not necessarily

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
trying to see,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
you still hold all the components

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
rightly in front of you,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
in Samatha.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
That's where Samatha carries

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Vipassana,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
vice versa,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
actively pursuing Vipassana

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
means you composing that

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
principle and keeping it

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
in front of you,

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
means Vipassana is

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
dragging Samatha with it.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And it's not optional,

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
if done rightly.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
That's where it's like

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
the two yolks,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
yolk to the two,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
two lobsters.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
So, one might go slightly forward

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
and another might,

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
that doesn't matter.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
They will both be going forward.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
But if you engage in any form

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
of Samatha,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
that is not based on mindfulness,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
not based on maintaining

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
the same principles,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
even if you don't necessarily

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
actively pursue them,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
well, you have no basis

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
for any Vipassana,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
which means that's

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
not Samatha.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
That's Patujan Samatha.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
That's his premeditation

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
or meditation under meditation

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
and so on.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
And that cannot possibly

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
magically sort of transfer you

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
into the right,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
right way of meditating.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
You just couldn't.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
So, I will just try to

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
stay in my own words

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
if I go there.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
So, that mindfulness

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
you are talking about,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
is actually the mindfulness

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
of this principle.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Mindfulness is, yes, mindfulness

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
is in common to Vipassana

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
and to Samatha.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
That's where every Jhana,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
it's not properly,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
which is what Jhana is,

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
when it's not properly,

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
has mindfulness as its basis.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
And you read that,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
you read one by one,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
sort of you read other,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
sort of mindfulness

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
is present in every Jhana.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
So, must be basically

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
founded upon it.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
So, instead of thinking

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
what kind of

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
contemporary sort of

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Buddhist schools think

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
and teach,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
that meditation

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
is some sort of concentration,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
that makes you focus

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
upon something

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
that you forget everything else.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Think about meditation

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Samatha literally means

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
composure.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
But if you're composing something,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
you need components for that,

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
something needs to be composed.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Something needs to be kept there,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
composed.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
And it's your mind,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
it's the principally

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
understanding of mindfulness

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
that we spoke about before.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
So, think of Samatha

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
or Samatha.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Think of Samatha

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
or Samatha as unwavering mindfulness.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Not actively engaging

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
on the basis that mindfulness

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
is just being mindful.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
So, mindfulness enduring.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Mindfulness is the

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
secret of mindfulness.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah, not like it doesn't

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
change at all.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Yes.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
It changes while remaining

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
the same.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Because mindfulness

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
is another phenomena.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
It's work.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Mindful of experience

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
is a whole which is the phenomena

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
that is present.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Is it not to be

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
right focused on one particular thing?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
But just to

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
actual and peripheral means

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
you see basically

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
from one point of view

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
you see both ends.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
You don't have to

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
chase them.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yes.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
You don't have to step into

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
the peripheral

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
and forget about actual

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
and chase actual

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
and forget about peripheral.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Like, the other one,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
what was the

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
that similarly?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Well, think about the other

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
similarly, basically, which can

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
serve the purpose

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
like a gatekeeper.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
You don't chase people

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
outside of the city

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
or inside the city.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
You just stay at one point

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
from which you know

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
whoever passes here

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
is inside,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
whoever goes out

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
is outside.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
That's all you need to know.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yes.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
So, in the same sense,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
that's how

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
you establish your mindfulness.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Now, by chasing the

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
particular sensations

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
or whatever

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
perceptions,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
but by being mindful

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
of the basis of them.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
And whatever.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
And they can change as fast

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
as they want.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
You won't lose your

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
mindfulness.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yes.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Because you haven't

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
based your mindfulness

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
on such a fleeting,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
particular notion.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
But, on a more general

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
of fundamental

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
recognition of the

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
experience as a whole,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
which is a basis

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
for these things changing.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
So, you don't care

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
how they change.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
You know, they have to

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
change inside of the city.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Because they have

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
a reason.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
They cease.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
They gone.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Now, they're not my concern.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Yes.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And what about

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
wholesome and unwholesome?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
The relationship

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
between my influence

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
and wholesome and unwholesome

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
states.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
You know, because that

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
gatekeeper needs

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
actually out

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
words and others.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
In order to get

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
sort of this kind of mindfulness,

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
they've established,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
developed and established.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Unwholesome habits,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
unwholesome behavior,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
unwholesome engaging

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
with unwholesome need to

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
have been already

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
kept at bay.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Obviously, sometimes,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
you sleep, you engage

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
in unwholesome.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
If you have right mindfulness,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
it will be quicker for you

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
to kind of readjust.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
And reset.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
And start doing things

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
rightly.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
That's the case for an

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
area.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
We can quickly pick back,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
pick up the training,

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
back.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
And do it even

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
after a slip.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
So, for Patujan,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
he needs to purify

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
his behavior beforehand.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
He needs to have been

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
engaging in a pure

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
behavior in a sense

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
of not getting into

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
the unwholesome.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
And as we spoke,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
a few days ago,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
there is an unwholesome.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah, there is the obvious

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
unwholesome.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
But often, that unwholesome

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
is actually determined

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
by the state of your mind.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Whether it's rooted

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
in desire,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
in craving,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
or if it's not rooted

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
in desire, in craving.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
So, that's what you become,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
aware of.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Not like, kind of,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
oh, well, everybody says

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
this is fine,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
and I'll do it.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
No, you know you'll be doing

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
it for the wrong reasons.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Yes.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
The reasons of pursuing

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
distraction,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
carelessness,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
whatever,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
and feeling justified about it.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
No, no, no, no.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
That needs to go.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
And then these things

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
can take root,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
if you,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
if you obviously apply,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
apply the effort.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
That's why the suitors

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
say that he practiced

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
restraint,

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
by the rules of Patujan,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
he sees the danger

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
in the slightest fault.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Yes.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Which means, basically,

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
even the slightest

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
danger in the slightest

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
giving into the desire.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yes, actually,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
that you are not

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
able to do anything.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
It doesn't mean you don't

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
do anything.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
It means you just do

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
things that are not

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
rooted in your

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
unhulsing desire.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
So if you want to go

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
for a walk,

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
because, well,

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
because you are

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
basically feel too lazy

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
to read the suitors

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
or maybe all you can,

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
they run in front of you,

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
you want to go for a walk

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
and then,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
that's okay.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
It is a compromise,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
you can see.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Going for a walk,

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
depending,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
like you want to go

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
into the wilderness,

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
well, that's not necessarily,

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
you're not going to

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
have any kind of

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
sensual distractions there.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So, you could sort of

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
do that compromise,

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
because it's quite

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
likely in the wilderness,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
your mind will go back

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
to the dharma.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
But, say, you go

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
for a walk and you

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
choose to go to the village.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
And then, you realize,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
well, you will be

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
meeting people,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
you will be engaging

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
with it.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
So, you might not

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
give rise to any

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
seriously unhulsing desire,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
or an offense,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
or something like that.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
But nevertheless,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
you're going for the purpose

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
of socializing,

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
turning your mind away

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
from the practice,

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
giving in

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
to distraction of others.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
So, that's unhulsing.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
If, for example,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
you want to go to the

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
wilderness because you want

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
to practice further,

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
then it's same.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Again, you go for a

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
same walk,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
but now it's

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
based in wholesome.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
It's done for good

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
reason.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
So, you become

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
responsible for

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
rooting it.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Or, like, you live in

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
the monastery.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
You live in a big temple.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Most, like, the

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
temples that have

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
a library,

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Buddhist libraries

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
every book you want.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
So, you are in your

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
boredom, the pressure,

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
the dread starts to

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
come up anxiety.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
You're a bit tired.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
You can't keep making

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
the effort.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
So, well, you know,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
it's obvious you'll feel

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
too guilty if you just

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
go to the

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
salon or reception

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
room where people are.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
But, no, you go to the

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
library to get the book.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
But, deep down,

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
or not even that deep down,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
just underneath that,

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
you hope that you will

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
meet people in library

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
to get somebody to talk

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
to and get your mind

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
off things.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Now, if you say that,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
you're going to

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
library to take some

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
practice.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Nobody will criticise

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
that.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Everyone will say,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
yeah, very well.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
He's really making the

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
effort.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
But, you know, that actually

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
you're doing it for

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
completely wrong reasons.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
So, then you shouldn't

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
do it.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Because there will be a

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
fault.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
But, sometimes, you don't

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
know actually because you

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
don't know.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Well, you have to know.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
It's not necessarily

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
you don't need a great

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
wisdom of a

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
sort of an

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
argument to discern that.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
You just need to be

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
honest to yourself.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That's why that,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
the mundane right view

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
is required for any

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
other right for you to

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
take place.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
That recognition,

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
that kind of

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
admitting things to

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
yourself,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
being transparent to

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
yourself, or as a

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
university, being authentic.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
So, you recognize why

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
am I going to library?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
What is the main

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
reason?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
And that's why, like, once

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
you say,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
develop in the transparency,

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
that's where, you know,

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
the contemplation of the

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
food.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Like, you can't help,

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
but eat.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
You have to eat,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
because otherwise you'll

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
die.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
And then, you can eat

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
for unwholesome reasons,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
or you can make the effort

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
and re-root the reasons

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
for your eating,

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
that are necessary.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Root them forcefully

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
if you have to,

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
in wholesome.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Don't give rights

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
to the desire,

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
and root them in wholesome.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Root them in the purpose

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
of your practice,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
purpose of this life,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
purpose of your commitment.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
That's why you eat.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
So, to remain healthy,

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
affliction-free,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
so that you can practice.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
So, it's not like,

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
or eating is bad,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
or eating is good.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
You make it so.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
If you remain mindful of,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
and if you're mindful of these,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
more general vague reasons,

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
why you eat,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
like, or to be coming out

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
hunting, to do this,

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
and to be able to practice,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
and to be able to

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
apply myself,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
then the desire can creep in.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
If you become mindful,

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
goes back to the default,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
which is with the grain,

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
which is with the flood,

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
which is with the desire,

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
with the taste,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
with the thirst.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
So, in the same sense,

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
sometimes you might

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
actually have to go

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
to the library.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
You really want to get these

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
sutras,

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
but you've been carefully

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
attending to that,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
unmindfully,

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
and the real reason

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
becomes meeting other people.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
So, then you have to re-roach it.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Then you have to keep bringing back

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
the other reason for getting

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
the sutra books,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and then go to the library,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
and if you do meet other people,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
you may therefore know engaging

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
with them, avoiding them,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
taking the books,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
and getting out.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Is this Sila Mata Paramasabh?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Well, it's within this.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Yeah.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Yeah.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
If you fully develop this

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
principle of transparency,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
paired with understanding of the

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
base of mindfulness,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
there would reveal the sign of the mind,

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
the notion of the phenomenon

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
of the mind.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Then you would recognize exactly

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
where the purpose of

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Sila, the virtue,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
and the butter,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
the duties, is.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
You would recognize it,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
and you wouldn't need to hold on to it,

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
because it took responsibility

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
for the whole thing.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
But if you don't recognize it,

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
that's when people say,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
no, no, no.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
But it's always good to go

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
and take the sutra.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
It's always good to be virtues.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Yes.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
It is always good to be virtues.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
It is always good to read the sutras.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
But the putugin as a mind can make

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
even that unwholesome.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
If it doesn't know that fundamentally,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
wholesome unwholesome is rooted in desire.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
So unwholesome is always rooted in desire.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And then in hindsight,

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
you can recognize it.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Oh, yes, of course.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
A sensuality of any kind,

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
anger,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
ill will of any kind,

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
cruelty of any kind.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
It's always rooted in desire.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
You cannot re-root the reasons for that.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
That's why you stop doing them beforehand.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
You take that on trust,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
so that you can develop that understanding.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Not just so that you can blindly

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
adhere to it for the rest of your life.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Yes.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Because they will not serve as a basis for wisdom

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
and knowledge.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
They will talk about it.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
So in that sense,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
the behavior needs to be purified beforehand,

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
and then obviously the practice of the
