1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But then something else is your situation on the general level.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You see what I mean?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You are mindful that you are here in the cave sitting on the floor while they're talking the Dharma.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But now you can have a thought of you sitting in the cave on the floor talking Dharma.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And that thought is particular for you now.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
While you're sitting in the cave on the floor talking about the Dharma, which remains general.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So it can be the same thought.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can see it twice or doubly, simultaneously.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can see the same thought on the particular level.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And you can see it on the same thought on a more general level.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's immediate in reflection approach.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But again, it's the same structure, same principle, same generality.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What you should not do is confuse then the particular things for general and I think they are general.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because they are particular.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And if you see them as general, then their general became particular and now something else is general.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Even if it's the same thing.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Either way, you lose the sight of the general, you lose the sight of the mindfulness.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's very unnatural.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Because natural means ignorant.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Natural means going with the grain as the Buddha referred to it.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But the practice of Dharma goes against the grain.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Against the way of thinking.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That doesn't mean you kind of go mad and do crazy things.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Just means you start thinking in the opposite direction.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And this is the opposite direction.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The most common thing is me, my cup, I want to drink the water.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But now you start thinking indirectly.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I can drink this water only because my situation allows it as a possibility.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Water to be drunk.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So you start bypassing your sense of self.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You start making it redundant.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because I want to drink water not.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The water is possible to be drunk because of the situation.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And that's why you can attend it.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So it is, my sense of self that comes with this intention, I want to drink the water.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Depends upon that intention, I want to drink the water.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Which is given by this situation that it's not in my control.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Therefore, my sense of self is something I can't control either.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Which means it's not my sense of self.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You don't have to define your situation.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can just know your situation.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because you are already in.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All this is given in the example.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
As I said, the situation can be as general as you want, such as unseated.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And you don't even have to say it to thinking.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You just know already that you are seated.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So recognizing situation, it's almost like on the level of knowledge.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because if I ask you, what's your body posture now?

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You will know that.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You won't have to get up in order to tell me that you were sitting down.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You'll know your seat.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So it's already there.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you don't need to keep it in the mind.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But yeah, over defining it means making it, approaching it in particular turns.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Which means you forget about general.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But the way I think, the way I think something about my situation about weight,

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
or it becomes particularly important to general.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's quite difficult to see.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, not to general.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thinking is particular.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thinking is particular.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, it can also be general.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Depends what you think.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Depends what how you think.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In other words, it doesn't mean that particular ceases.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
As I said, particular in return makes the general possible.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The things that you see particularly, you realize, oh, it's because of this,

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and my situation has a reason.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But then the particular things are defined as such because of your situation.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's like two sticks.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can't conceive them separate from each other.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So even for another general in particular, that all remains the same.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's ignorance in regard to the structure, and taking it as mine,

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and everything, that's gone.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But yeah, of course, yeah, that's how it works.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It doesn't mean that you go into general and everything in particular disappears.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Impossible.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's quite difficult, I don't know.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But general particular is the five aggregates.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Potugina holds them.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Arun doesn't.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So general in particular is the structure.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's the same in Arun and in Potugina.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Potugina holds it as a result of his ignorance.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So he has great version delusion, nothing else.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Arun doesn't.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So that's a difference.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This whole relationship of sitting in the room while sitting, talking to you,

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it's the same for Arun or Potugina.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's just the Potugina takes it as mine.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're welcome.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And it's because Potugina takes things as mine in regard to hunger or thirst,

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
particular or general, he suffers.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Arun doesn't take his mind, he doesn't suffer further.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
For Arun, there's no serve build.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And how could you see anything something in Potugina?

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You see, everything to me must become general for Arun.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, see the point.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The flowers can drink the water.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He's only possible for you to attend and go and drink the water

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
because he was available.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He was possible.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
None of that, that's the same for Arun and Potugina.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There makes no difference.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That is indifferent to your sense of self.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The situation allowed for a drinkable water to be present.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And then, oh, I'm thirsty and I can drink the water.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So it makes no difference whether you take it as mine or not.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because it didn't come from you.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It came from the general situation.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How does he feel?

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If he's thirsty, he feels significance of thirst.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So then the water will make sense.

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But he knows that the water and the entire situation originates external to him.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Nothing to do with him.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So whether he drinks the water or not, or while he drinks the water,

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
he won't think of me and myself and for me,

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because he understood the entire situation

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that already holds this particular drinking water experience in it.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He understood that is not self.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's still young, actually very beautiful.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What makes me still I feel that why is it important to think this situation?

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Because I think whatever it is,

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
because whatever you can feel,

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
it means appearing as a bubble in the mind,

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
whatever appears, I think if all of them,

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
if I can see clearly these things,

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
my control appears in everything.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Isn't it enough?

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's self then. What are you seeing just what's in front of you?

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If these bubbles, if I can see that,

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
cannot support the same view.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, you're seeing the bubbles,

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
but what is overseeing you're seeing?

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Means I'm standing outside.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Means you're assuming yourself outside.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
By assuming these things in front of you,

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
you put yourself out,

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
which means you don't really include your sense of self there.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So there is seeing, there are bubbles.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There are bubbles being seen.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So you're seeing everything,

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
but you're not seeing the nature of seeing.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If I could think that only I can think of myself as a self view.

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is my self.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If I can think that these bubbles only I can think,

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
they're really good at mind.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Then my mind, I am,

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
it's included in these bubbles.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Only because that only could come from the perspective.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Not quite.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No, no.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No, see, because when you say,

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the fact that bubbles already arise for you,

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
no matter how you think them afterwards,

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
a sense of self was already there.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So you're just managing the situation,

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
as opposed to uprooting it.

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, but you actually,

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I never see any other,

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
really appearing as bubbles.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
These are actually coring as mine, I am.

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No, you will not.

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You won't see that.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because if the sense of self and sense of mind

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
was to appear right in front of you so clearly,

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
you wouldn't need a Buddha to become an Arant.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But then what did some coring as myself?

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, that depends, really.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You can call any of the aggregates myself.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And the thing is,

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
you expect to find a particular thing

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
that you called myself.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But as I said,

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
my sense of self is never particular,

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
is always general.

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So, but if using to look at the general level,

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you'll never see the sense of self.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Because you expect to find it on the particular level.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And it doesn't appear there.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So no wonder you can't find the sense of self anyway.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But the fact that we can talk about your sense of self,

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
means there is something being designated as such.

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Something very ambiguous,

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
unclear, general, non-particular.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And as such, it is real,

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
it is present as a phenomena.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So you have to start seeing it like that

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
in order to be able to understand it like that.

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But if you're just used to seeing things in front of you,

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
bubbles, particular,

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
sense of self never appears like that,

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
which is why it's sense of self.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And that's why you can never see it.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But if you see your general situation,

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
which is where sense of self is,

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you see that has fully determined

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
by these particular random bubbles.

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Indirectly,

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
then you're already,

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
like, uprooting your sense of self

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
without directly looking at it.

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because you can't.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Whenever you look directly,

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
your sense of self is behind your look.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's how it works.

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It means need to see the relation.

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How these bubbles appeared.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, no, that's not the relation.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
See, that's the explanation.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How the bubbles appeared would be an explanation.

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And the fact that the bubbles are there

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
means you're in the situation.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The fact that you're in situation

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
means bubble can appear as bubble.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Now, sense of self

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
lingers somewhere in between.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But you can never look at it directly

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
because it's always behind your look.

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So then you learn to know

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
where it is without needing to look.

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because looking will hide it.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It means for me not able to see

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
what I'm calling myself or something.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No, directly.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Not as a particular thing.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can know it indirectly

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
where your sense of self is.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You can't look at it directly

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
because look comes from the sense of self.

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was feeling that whatever,

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
what do I feel inside the body or in the mind?

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Those things are actually

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
thinking as mine, myself.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
My feelings, my thoughts, everything.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
These all combine together.

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was thinking, here I am.

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Well, even those things.

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The sense of mind is in regard

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to the things.

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The mind is not in the things.

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So in other words,

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
it's your attitude towards certain things

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
that is the attitude of mind.

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So that doesn't mean that everything is yours.

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It just means there's some things,

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
it's enough for some things

250
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
to be regarded as mine.

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Sense of self is there.

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Sense of self.

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So even the sense of mind doesn't appear

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
clearly right in front of you.

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's also general in regard to

256
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
particular things that you took as mine.

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Attitude.

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What is attitude?

259
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Can you see your attitude particularly?

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, here it is.

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You can't.

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's an attitude in regard to things.

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So it's a mental phenomenon.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Or just a phenomenon.

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Done.

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But it is always clear.

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Everything else.

268
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Well, yeah.

269
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It doesn't mean that it's permanent,

270
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
but it means it's in regard to everything.

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So when you're looking at things in front of you,

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you're not seeing your attitude in regard to those things.

273
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're just seeing what's in front of you.

274
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And that's why it's wrong.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You leave your attitude out.

276
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But your attitude is that which needs to be changed.

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Not the things.

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because they were not a problem in the first place.

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So the bubbles, they're all bubbles, whatever.

280
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But it's a attitude in regard to them

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
that you need to change.

282
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Not them.

283
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
For pututina, always looking at everything

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
to the record.

285
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Based on self view, everything is mine.

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No, no, no.

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No, it's not everything.

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I am.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But pututina takes his, takes not self with self,

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
or takes self with not self,

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
or takes self with self.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But he cannot do,

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
what he cannot do is take not self with not self.

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Is it something, I'm supposed to be looking at something.

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Everything I'm thinking, I am looking at this.

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But maybe he is looking at it.

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, yeah.

298
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
In a way you can say that.

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But he can think, I am looking at this.

300
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But the thought of I am looking at this is not his.

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's not I.

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's not me.

303
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There is no conceit.

304
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's all gone.

305
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So then it's just a designation, I am.

306
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I was thinking.

307
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What do I do?

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What do I do?

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Maybe I was thinking, I am doing everything, looking at it.

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No, that's like when you're trying to force the view

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
or already I and this on this.

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But no, you have to find yourself within that situation.

313
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And that's how you abandon it.

314
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Like if you're producing things in front of you constantly,

315
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
you are doing that, which means that you, which is doing it,

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
it's not included there.

317
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's why I can never work.

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But for producer, it's not a temper, you know,

319
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you know, the record is, same view is already there.

320
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The attitude in regard to the most fundamental aspects of the aggregates,

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
yeah, it's always the same, which is why it's a producer.

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And when I say the most fundamental, I mean the most general.

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So he might not be taking this particular,

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
this particular flask carpet cushion is mine.

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But he's taking the whole general situation.

326
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
His body at least has mine.

327
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Therefore, whatever situation his body ends up being in,

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
he'll imply his sense of self in it.

329
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And whether through for me or not for me or me or both or neither.

330
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So that's why he needs to be undone in that indirect manner,

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
through undoing the situation.

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
To see things actually, generally, in the record something,

333
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I have to put something outside,

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
not to see something, like a...

335
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No, the same answer.

336
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You just have to discern it where it is, how it is,

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
without having to move it about in order to understand it.

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
To the extent the thing has a reason,

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that's how and that's where you have to understand it.

340
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's discernment.

341
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Discerning what's given.

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The things given by you to discern within that what's given,

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
how, what's important, what's impermanent, and so on.

344
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's very new, actually.

345
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is the teaching of Venomanyam.

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't really know how much this is now.

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think here it's within the same, same ideas.

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But it's from the sutras.

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You didn't invent anything.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
From the sutras?

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, of course.

352
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, if you see all of this explanations you can find in the sutras.

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Obviously, the sutras being so general,

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
like, you know, Bikobodi calls the sutras to support his three life interpretation.

355
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Because he finds parts, they've nothing to do with it,

356
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
but he's on par, but he would call them for a petition par.

357
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And then when he needs to, he would ignore the abstract principle,

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
just to support the view.

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And the sutras allow that because they're so profound and so general

360
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:41,000
in the description that actually people can use them, misuse them.

361
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Which is why, like, if you start thinking like this,

362
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
then you can start reading the sutras in this way.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And then they will read very differently.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Then they will become apparent why, like, one sutra is enough for all of them.

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Even before understanding.

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Before you were reading sutras in different ways.

367
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, before I was reading sutras, I had everybody else does.

368
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Like, kind of wise inspiration, but kind of product of folklore,

369
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
India, long time ago, ancient text type.

370
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But then I started reading in the Vera.

371
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well, then I started reading extension philosophy

372
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that was making lots of sense in terms of intention, action,

373
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
responsibility, feelings, anxiety, and so on.

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Then I started reading in the Vera,

375
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
talking about the sutras in those terms.

376
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And I realized, wow, you can actually...

377
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, you can read it as an ancient sacred text

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that just produced poetic inspiration.

379
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But you can also read it as an existential

380
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
phenomenological description of experience right here right now.

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And if you stop and think which of those two ways,

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
either a romantic inspiration or a phenomenological accurate,

383
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
actual description of your experience,

384
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
which one of those two is most likely to make an around,

385
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
you realize it's the latter one.

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If you read it as a description of the universal aspects of the experience,

387
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
whether two and a half thousand years ago, whether now,

388
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
whether two and a half thousand years later,

389
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
it's still the same universal experience.

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You understand it like that?

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, yeah, of course.

392
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
All you need is one sutra to become an around,

393
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
if you fully understand it.

394
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Whether it's been spoken two millennia ago,

395
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
or now, or ten millennia later, just makes no difference.

396
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's the same thing spoken.

397
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And that's what the Buddha said when he discovered the Dalma,

398
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
he realized, oh, it's like finding an ancient path

399
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that was already there.

400
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He didn't invent himself, nothing.

401
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So that's what I said to people like,

402
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
you know, you don't need to get into all the philosophy

403
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and everything that he talks about.

404
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But at least if you get the attitude towards the sutras from him,

405
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you can't ask for more.

406
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And how to read the art approach.

407
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, it's very interesting.

408
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, because then you read the sutras

409
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and you stop and think about every single sentence.

410
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Because as I said, you read our consciousness and do I even know

411
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
putting the sutras in my own terms what consciousness is?

412
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't.

413
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So how can I expect that that which I think consciousness is,

414
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
is that which the Buddha talks about when he says consciousness?

415
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And then you stop and think further.

416
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And you realize, well, if my thought of consciousness

417
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
would correspond to the Buddha's thought of consciousness,

418
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I would be an other hand, or at least a sutra partner.

419
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But I'm neither of those, therefore,

420
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
when I think consciousness, that's not the consciousness

421
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
the Buddha talks about.

422
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So you keep drilling and drilling and drilling.

423
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And then even if you read this, you come back to it.

424
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And you read again.

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Many times.

426
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's very interesting.

427
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't know if I can't explain it in such a way.

428
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's very interesting.

429
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, I don't know.

430
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I haven't heard anybody speak.

431
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So it's different.

432
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
In these 10 years.

433
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You had no teacher, you said?

434
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
No, no, no.

435
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
No teacher.

436
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But I haven't even heard anybody resembling

437
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
this type of approach when they speak.

438
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This way of thinking.

439
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So it's not surprising that you have no idea.

440
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Through your experience and through your meditation.

441
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, yeah, through experience, through meditation,

442
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
through the sutras, through the pondering and understanding,

443
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
you get to see where people come from when they talk about it.

444
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And I haven't really heard anybody

445
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
even coming remotely from this direction.

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The direction that I was talking about,

447
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the direction that's implied in the sutras.

448
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That doesn't mean that there aren't any,

449
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
but just I haven't heard.

450
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
There are some monks that don't agree with the sutras.

451
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Some of them say that they are some of them wrong.

452
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, yeah, exactly.

453
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, that's the thing.

454
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It was such a long time ago when they were spoken.

455
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You can't prove, you can't disapprove either.

456
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So when people come across some parts,

457
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
they can't come to terms with,

458
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
oh, they must have been introduced later.

459
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's like, well, yeah.

460
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
How do you feel? Do you agree with this?

461
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't care.

462
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I mean, it's kind of relevant.

463
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think it's a silly thing to do,

464
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
because unless you're a sotapana,

465
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
you have no criteria of what's right, what's wrong,

466
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
which is why you're not a sotapana.

467
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Therefore, when you choose to ignore certain parts

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
because you believe that they were introduced or whatever else,

469
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
well, you're following your protrusion as criteria.

470
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So it's, again, you don't know for sure,

471
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
but to be on the safe side,

472
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
you take it all.

473
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You accept it all just so that you can practice

474
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and hopefully get the right view.

475
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
When you get the right view, then certain things might become more apparent.

476
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, I don't really know whether this came later or not.

477
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But if there are such parts,

478
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
they won't pertain to the demo.

479
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It might pertain to some story

480
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
or some social relationship or something.

481
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It will not pertain to the four noble truths

482
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and the concept, the main concept, is just you won't.

483
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Because if it does, you will know this is wrong.

484
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This is not the Buddha.

485
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Which is why when you read Mahayana sotras,

486
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
it's not a single Buddha word there.

487
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Near it?

488
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's part of stuff.

489
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I read at least the huinei and the six-part chat.

490
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Six-part chat, huinei and hard sutra and stuff.

491
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It was just very strange.

492
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I mean, it's not debatable that it's introduced later

493
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
by their own teachers and preachers.

494
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But the thing is, you know,

495
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
there can be things introduced later,

496
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
new arahats coming and teaching in their own terms.

497
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It will still be the same Dharma.

498
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And if it isn't, it means it's not.

499
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They're not arahats.

500
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And you can see that.

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It's not a problem.

502
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You see that when you are barapai, you eat or not.

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You don't have to disagree in the sutras.

504
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You must avoid it.

505
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It depends.

506
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
If they're disagreeing with the key concepts,

507
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
if they're dismissing the teachers and the body,

508
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
you should dismiss Him.

509
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You don't have to dismiss His scholarship,

510
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
but His views should be considered.

511
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Again, as I said,

512
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You know, needing to be a son of something, if you stop thinking about it well,

513
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
even as an abstract principle, but it's still a principle within which the whole,

514
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
the only reason it's abstract is because a person does not see directly.

515
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So if anything, if you call something abstract principle means

516
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that's something you didn't understand, which is why it is abstract.

517
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's abstract only in regard to its content, not in its nature.

518
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So principle is principle.

519
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh, that principle is abstract for me because I don't understand it.

520
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So if everybody starts with this principle and then you have somebody comes

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and dismisses the principle and gives you a different explanation,

522
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
you should be doubtful of that.

523
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Or if somebody goes even further and blatantly says,

524
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
no, I disagree with that sort of.

525
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Like, some of these sort of, I think that's all wrong.

526
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Well, you shouldn't waste your time speaking to them then, if they say such thing.

527
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Because some of these sort of does not pertain to any traditional,

528
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
any cultural, any product of the ancient India.

529
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It pertains to the right view and the noble way for path.

530
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So if somebody dismisses that, well, they're not really following the Buddha's teaching,

531
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
even if they're monks.

532
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, generally, everybody's teaching if someone doesn't agree with it.

533
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's okay.

534
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, that's different.

535
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because what they're not agreeing, they're not agreeing with an interpretation

536
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
of the Buddha's teaching.

537
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
They don't agree with the view of the Buddha's teaching.

538
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You see, some are here, they don't agree with it.

539
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Well, no, no, see, that's the thing.

540
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They might disagree or they might not be able to comprehend all of the things

541
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
in a bit of a saying.

542
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But I think with little effort, they would understand the basic ideas

543
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and they would know whether in a way that was or wasn't a sort of department,

544
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
if they were truly artists.

545
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But people often dismiss it entirely.

546
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, they're still, they know their putuginers,

547
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
but they don't know that there's putuginers.

548
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
They cannot know what's right, what's wrong.

549
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I met quite a lot of monks there, senior monks there,

550
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
who would know, who would openly say, oh, I haven't had anything.

551
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But they wouldn't stop them from saying what you should do in terms of practice,

552
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
which is a contradiction in terms.

553
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you don't know yourself, what you need to do in terms of the right view,

554
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
how can you even conceive teaching somebody else to get the right view?

555
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's just mind-bubbling contradiction that doesn't seem to stop them.

556
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So then coming from the same place,

557
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
if they come across something they don't like,

558
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
they don't like the way it was put out, they don't like the way it was taught.

559
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
These pleases them or whatever,

560
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
such as in the videos books and his views, they'll dismiss it.

561
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Knowing themselves their putuginers and they have no criteria for the true dismissal,

562
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
they'll dismiss it, which is why they stay putuginers.

563
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.

564
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, that's just how it works.

565
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah.

566
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So as putuginers, you don't know what's right, you don't know what's wrong.

567
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That's why the element of faith is necessary.

568
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But that faith should be like govern or guided or directed by intelligence.

569
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Not just blind faith, but you accept everything called Buddhism,

570
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
but you discern and you think what is least likely to be wrong.

571
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I don't know what's right.

572
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Everything might be wrong.

573
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What is least likely to be wrong,

574
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and then I'll start putting my effort in that.

575
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And then if I was a little bit fortunate,

576
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
if I was intelligent enough, I might have chosen the right thing,

577
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and with a sufficient amount of effort I could,

578
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'll get a confirmation that it's right thing,

579
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
which is one of the sutras the Buddha would refer to,

580
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
sort of one as somebody who has a confirmed confidence in them.

581
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Like they were confident, this is least likely the correct thing,

582
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and then they had that thought confirmed when they became sort of one.

583
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So they know, they they know.

584
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
If sort of one, if you become sort of one,

585
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
everything or faith and everything to the...

586
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Well, the faith gets replaced by confidence.

587
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It all becomes unshakable faith,

588
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
which is not really faith anymore, it's confidence.

589
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
He knows that he knows.

590
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And he cannot even conceive,

591
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
because the Buddha is the Dhamma.

592
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Dhamma is the Buddha.

593
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So it's not...

594
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's not that the Buddha is the person,

595
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
or something who happened to say something right.

596
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
No, the Buddha is that teaching.

597
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So they understood the teaching, they understood the Buddha.

598
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So that's what it's inconceivable for them to now follow a different teacher.

599
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And when I say a different teacher,

600
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I don't mean another monk who might be teaching the same,

601
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
and then they have, okay, I'll listen to you a bit more,

602
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
because you seem like they did follow Sariputta.

603
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
No, when I say a different teacher, I mean Christian.

604
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Teaching Christian philosophy, Christian views,

605
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
or Western science for that matter,

606
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
because that's almost like religion today, or psychology.

607
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
They wouldn't be able to adopt that,

608
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
because it's a wrong view.

609
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The only way they could adopt any other teaching,

610
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
if it's the teaching that's the same as the Dhamma,

611
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
it would be the Dhamma.

612
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's actually interesting.

613
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Some Christians, they can become Arya, you know?

614
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Not through Christianity, you know?

615
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Not through Christianity.

616
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I've had a venerable man told me that in the Buddha was Arya,

617
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
what time they were sold upon there was something,

618
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and in this life they were born as Christian or something,

619
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
at least in Christian family.

620
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Then something, anyway.

621
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
No, that makes no difference.

622
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
What view your family holds,

623
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and what had it that you're born in, that's irrelevant.

624
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
No, what view you hold,

625
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and what teaching you follow personally to try to understand,

626
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
that's what matters.

627
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So somebody can my world be a Christian priest,

628
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
if he ponders on impermanence,

629
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and suffering, and nature or not self,

630
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
he ponders on Dhamma.

631
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And if he becomes an Arya,

632
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
he becomes because of the Dhamma,

633
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
not because of his belief in imaginary friend.

634
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
If they become Arya with being the Christian,

635
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
all of those believe that they go...

636
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Well, they would see them as wrong.

637
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Wrong.

638
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Well, not even.

639
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Like, they would see them as irrelevant.

640
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Like, the belief in God and everything,

641
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
not as much as it's wrong,

642
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
but it's just irrelevant.

643
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It makes no difference.

644
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Obviously, it makes a difference for people who don't know

645
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
and put their whole life in those beliefs.

646
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Beliefs.

647
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But if somebody understood the nature of suffering

648
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and freedom from it,

649
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
belief, it just doesn't even apply belief in God anymore.

650
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I have this country with many people,

651
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
they believe in astrology and horoscope and everything.

652
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
What's the problem?

653
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Well, it's a superstition.

654
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's the most kind of primal attitude towards, you know,

655
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
the unknown.

656
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
People are superstitious,

657
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
magic and all kinds of good signs and bad signs.

658
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's basically like something people need to do

659
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
in order to quickly escape anxiety,

660
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
anxiety of an existing individual.

661
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Because, you know, just being alive already means

662
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
you're in a parallel situation

663
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
because you can die at any time

664
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and you're absolutely no sane in it.

665
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And just that single thought

666
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
can freak people out,

667
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
can make them mad.

668
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
If they really are who.

669
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Like, you just, you couldn't stop it.

670
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Your whole world can end in a second

671
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and you can't do anything about it.

672
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So the immediate response to that

673
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
is,

674
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
nobody will all be good, I believe.

675
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
God will protect me,

676
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
or Universal Energy will protect me,

677
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
or my horoscope tell me I'll be fortunate.

678
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Anything like that, just to give you

679
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
the little grain of hope to overcome it

680
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and allows you enough to not look at the anxiety.

681
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Because if you keep looking,

682
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
you'll go mad.

683
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And the Buddha did say that.

684
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
He said that if somebody experienced suffering

685
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
rightly,

686
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
correctly, that anxiety

687
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
opened clear without any cover

688
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
of the views and superstition

689
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and all sorts of other religions,

690
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
there are only two outcomes.

691
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Mental derangement,

692
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
or search.

693
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
A noble search

694
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
they will bring that pain

695
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and if somebody is strong enough to not go mad,

696
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
it would result in them looking for a medicine

697
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
that can remove this pain.

698
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So that's the state the person needs to be in.

699
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It needs to be open to the extension

700
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
anxiety to such an extent

701
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
that there is a risk of madness,

702
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
but that means there is also

703
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a possibility of the right search.

704
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Doesn't mean the person actually has to go mad.

705
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But that means the person has to stop

706
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
covering it up through superstition,

707
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
through horoscope,

708
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
through empty beliefs,

709
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
through magic,

710
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and so on.

711
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Mental weakness.

712
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Mental weakness.

713
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Which one?

714
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
The astrology.

715
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Good.

716
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Good.

717
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
When he...

718
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
When he got...

719
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh yeah, the suspicious signs.

720
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Well, he didn't refuse it completely

721
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
in terms of...

722
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The divine interventions.

723
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So, let's say,

724
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
can't say the truth.

725
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What do they say?

726
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It comes through.

727
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Sometimes.

728
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Sometimes.

729
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But it's always 50-50, isn't it?

730
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So, it means five out of ten

731
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
can always get it right.

732
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Because I say this will happen,

733
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
or that will happen.

734
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Well, one of the thought comes,

735
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
will happen.

736
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So, I have 50% of chance

737
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
of being right.

738
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
The Buddha never dismissed that,

739
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
but he never,

740
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
ever used it as a...

741
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Like, in reference to the pertain

742
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
to the court of the teaching

743
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and feelings of a censor

744
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
or whatever else.

745
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So, that also...

746
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Like, back to the question,

747
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
well, how did he use it then?

748
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
In what sense?

749
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Whether it was like a real divine.

750
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Like, there are people who could,

751
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
even back in the day,

752
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
who could develop like supernatural abilities,

753
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
and they could see a future destination

754
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
based on the current actions you're doing.

755
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And then,

756
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
there are people who can see

757
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
or two or three next destinations

758
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
based on the current actions you're doing.

759
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
There are people who can see ten.

760
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So, yeah.

761
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And then, if they say,

762
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
well, this is your...

763
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
like...

764
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
future projection,

765
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
then that's true.

766
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But again, it's not set in stone.

767
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Because if you change your behavior,

768
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
you can change your future outcome.

769
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Like, with the current set of mental...

770
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
determinations and things you do,

771
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and whether actions are wholesome and unwholesome,

772
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
you are heading to heaven.

773
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But if that changes,

774
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
if you start misbehaving with doing some unwholesome stuff,

775
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
you won't be going to heaven.

776
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And that's what the Buddha said.

777
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Sometimes people see only one life ahead.

778
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And then they say,

779
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and then they see somebody here,

780
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
misbehaving.

781
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But they see his next life is heaven.

782
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Then they see somebody behaving,

783
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
but they see his next life is also heaven.

784
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And then they say,

785
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
oh, makes no difference whether you behave,

786
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
or you misbehaved,

787
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
you're reborn in heaven.

788
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But then another person comes and says,

789
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
five lives are ahead.

790
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And then he says,

791
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
well, yeah, he might be in the heaven next life.

792
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Because actually in the previous life,

793
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
he did some good stuff.

794
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But next four lives are misery.

795
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The one who behaves,

796
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
all five will be heaven.

797
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And then he says,

798
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
no, it matters how you behave,

799
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
whether good or bad.

800
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So even those views are limited,

801
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
but they all pertain to the extent of,

802
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
like, nature of samsara,

803
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
what might be ahead of you,

804
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and so on,

805
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
not to the way to escape it.

806
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Which is what the Buddha was concerned about.

807
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Because if you're an Arant,

808
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
that's it.

809
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
No matter.

810
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And I think he was slightly mocking them,

811
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
but he was also proving a point.

812
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
There was that divine,

813
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
he would do this divine divination.

814
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
He would look at the skull.

815
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
They would give him a skull for that person.

816
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And he would tap on it,

817
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and do some things.

818
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And they say,

819
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
he is reborn in such and such place.

820
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And I think there must have been something,

821
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
he might have had some of the abilities

822
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
to see in the future,

823
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
which doesn't mean nothing.

824
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But Ujjana can see future reverts.

825
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's no salvation.

826
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's just,

827
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
if I tell you tomorrow,

828
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
you're most likely be home.

829
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
In 10 years,

830
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you might be next life,

831
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
you might be some,

832
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
like, at such and such place.

833
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's within the same nature of things.

834
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Like, if I tell you,

835
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
in five minutes,

836
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
you'll do this,

837
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and in, you know,

838
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
five hundred lifetimes,

839
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
you'll do that.

840
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It's a greater on a scale,

841
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
but it's the same thing.

842
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So when they brought this skull

843
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
to this man of a monk,

844
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
who died, who was an Arant,

845
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
he tapped it,

846
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
and then he was confused,

847
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and then he kept tapping it,

848
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and he couldn't,

849
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
he couldn't see anything.

850
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And it's like,

851
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
well, that's because he's not reborn anyway.

852
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Because that's exactly what I'm talking about.

853
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yes, I really do.

854
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Well, yeah, the thing is,

855
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
but the problem is,

856
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
people don't take you to like that.

857
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
They take it as a,

858
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
as a setting stone divine,

859
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
like, completely blessed.

860
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, I'm blessed because I was told,

861
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
no,

862
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
at the time when you were told,

863
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
if that person who told you,

864
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
could truly see it,

865
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
you were having it at the heaven,

866
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
the destination.

867
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That's because,

868
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
back then,

869
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
your behavior was good.

870
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But they don't tell you that.

871
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
They just tell you,

872
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
you go to heaven,

873
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and that's it.

874
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I spent my rest of my life thinking,

875
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I go to heaven,

876
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
no matter what I do.

877
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And that's exactly what Christians,

878
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
what they've been doing,

879
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you know, the crusade,

880
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
the wars and stuff.

881
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You go plundering,

882
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
raping, murdering, stealing,

883
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
stealing with the belief

884
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
of you going to heaven,

885
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
because you were told.

886
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But actually,

887
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
even that depends on you right now,

888
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
actions.

889
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So you might,

890
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
you will be better off if somebody tells you,

891
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
if you behave wholesomely,

892
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
if you don't give in to anger,

893
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
don't give it to greed,

894
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
don't give it to any aversion,

895
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
you're most likely going to heaven.

896
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And you don't need any special,

897
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
natural powers to know that,

898
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
you just need a simple intelligent reflection

899
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
which I started this talk with,

900
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
when somebody thinks,

901
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
well, whether I miss behave or not,

902
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
if there is a future life or not,

903
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
it's better to behave.

904
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You're better off if somebody tells you that,

905
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
because then,

906
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
for the rest of your life,

907
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
you'll be doing things rightly

908
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
with that thought of a good river

909
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and the Buddha did say that, actually.

910
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
He said,

911
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
behaving properly,

912
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
keeping the seal and virtues

913
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
goes to more fortunate destinations.

914
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That's better to be told,

915
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
then if somebody just tells you,

916
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
oh, yes, you're heading to heaven

917
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and you take it for granted.

918
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And if they truly knew that you were heading to heaven,

919
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
they probably wouldn't just tell you,

920
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
you're heading to heaven.

921
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You will tell you,

922
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
you're heading to heaven,

923
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
if you keep behaving properly like you're doing now.

924
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But unless you hear that,

925
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
then be a bit more doubtful,

926
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
just in case.

927
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Again, even if they're right or not,

928
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
you can't tell,

929
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
so it's better to be on the same side.

930
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So that's how the Buddha approached you.

931
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It doesn't mean there's absolutely nothing to it,

932
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
but whatever it is,

933
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
it still depends on what you do right here right now.

934
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So it doesn't really mean much.
