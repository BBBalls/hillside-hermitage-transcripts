1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
How can I get rid of attachments to things that are to be free from being attached to things?

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:27,080
Well the first step is to stop, stop using them for again in pleasure.

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,460
So you have to refrain from obtaining pleasure through the things you are attached to.

4
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:40,320
Because attachment is inseparable from the notion of being pleasant, whatever it is.

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,700
If it's your house, if it's your spouse, your children, your friends, attachment to them

6
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,460
means to that degree, there is a degree of pleasure in them, in their company, in their

7
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,360
presence, in what they can do for you, what they can provide you with and so on.

8
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,760
So you have to basically stop maintaining that attachment through constantly exhibiting

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,840
the behavior of that, of gaining pleasure through them.

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,440
And then start seeing the opposite, that it's actually not pleasant but dangerous to be

11
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,520
attached, yeah. Because if you start, all you have to do, like say in telling you

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,680
you attach your house, all you have to do is start pondering, thinking on the quite

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,640
a real possibility of losing it, like through a natural catastrophes or anything, basically

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,980
to things can happen, that are beyond your control, they can happen at any time to you.

15
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,320
And then you realize that your whole world of dependence upon those things, that's what

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,600
attachment is, it's going to be swept away with it, and it's very dangerous.

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:04,480
So when you recognize that perilous situation you are right there, in it you will, well,

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,600
you will want to be not attached to those things, and that's a first step really.

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,360
How much do you throw those things away?

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,480
No, see destroying those things does not free you from attachment or the things, because

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,160
the attachment is not the things, it's your attitude in regard to them.

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,320
Now it is the most natural response then, like when I'm attached to this, I'll throw

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,080
it away, I'll break it apart, I'll say note it, but that doesn't affect your mind,

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,760
your attitude of attachment, which means another thing will slot in, instead of it sooner

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
later, you're going to give in.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,920
So in order to free yourself from attachment, you need to basically discern the reasons

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,320
for your attachment, and things are not the reasons, they are the objects of your attachment.

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,400
The reasons is, well, fear for your life, fear for your safety, fear for your health, fear

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
of boredom, fear of not having anything to do, fear of loneliness, all those things that

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,560
people are afraid of, and that's where they're attached to other people and to other things.

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,400
So that's what you want to overcome, those fears, and not act out of those fears, and the

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,880
very first step of overcoming any fear is being aware of it, admitting it, discerning it,

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:25,840
you can't tell from someone's output appearance that they have free from attachment.

34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,680
No, no, no, no, no, a person can be theoretically, can be living in a very nice house, a very comfortable

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,400
life, have lots of luxuries, but internally genuinely not be attached to it, but it's highly

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,680
unlikely today that that will be the case because it takes a lot of effort, and if a person

37
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,760
is able to make that effort and gain their wisdom, they wouldn't be investing all their

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,400
time in maintaining all those things and luxuries, they're probably giving it up naturally,

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,000
not as a response of, oh, I'm bound by this, I'm sort of trapped by my attachment, so I'll

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,600
just destroy the objects of it and pretend I'm not attached.

41
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,600
No, they would be overcoming it through proper understanding, they would be removing the

42
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,440
actual attachment, not affecting things, so then if something were to happen to those things,

43
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,800
they wouldn't suffer an account of it, but it doesn't mean they seek out the destruction

44
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,480
of those things beforehand in order to prove themselves that they're not, if you need

45
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,320
to prove to yourself that you're attached, means you don't know, sorry, if you need to

46
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,040
prove to yourself that you're not attached, means you don't know that you're not attached,

47
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,480
means you're doubting, it means you are attached, if you're not free from doubt, you can't

48
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:49,000
say you're free, so outwardly, it's not a measure of attachment, a person can have a big

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,200
family, many children, but not actually be attached to them if he has wisdom, so he'll

50
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,720
be helping them, being there for them, but if something happens, he won't be destroyed

51
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:10,680
and completely, completely unable to continue his life.
