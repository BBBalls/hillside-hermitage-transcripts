00:00.000 --> 00:21.880
It's hard to practice noble silence by not engaging in any distracting behavior by practicing

00:21.880 --> 00:35.120
wakefulness. So anything that you discern that it's rooted in an unnecessary desire to distract

00:35.120 --> 00:41.840
yourself, to take your mind away from your present situation and your mindful off, that's

00:41.840 --> 00:49.480
basically against the practice of wakefulness. But it's also important to note it's not

00:49.480 --> 00:53.120
like you don't need to be forcing your mind like I'm present I'm present because your

00:53.120 --> 00:58.120
present where you want to be or not, it's not an option. It's not an option, it's not

00:58.120 --> 01:03.800
optional. Lots of mindfulness, lots of wakefulness, all these things are rooted in basically

01:03.800 --> 01:09.720
unwholesome intentions which means you cannot become un-wakeful, non-wakeful if you don't

01:09.720 --> 01:16.000
engage in any intentional act based on greed andversion delusion. So if the mind's intentions

01:16.000 --> 01:22.560
are not rooted in any of the unwholesome things, that you cannot be un-wakeful. And that's

01:22.560 --> 01:28.560
already a noble silence, you're not distracted. This means you never speak to anyone or you

01:28.560 --> 01:34.440
never do anything whatsoever. You just don't do things that are rooted in desire of greed,

01:34.440 --> 01:42.040
aversion or distraction and delusion. Why is it silence? Because the mind quives

01:42.040 --> 01:48.880
down. When the mind is distracted, the thoughts, the verbal thoughts, the kind of dialects,

01:48.880 --> 01:54.960
it's going on, the whole dialectic of thinking. But once you haven't been, and again people

01:54.960 --> 01:59.360
who are going to stop this thinking, well you can't stop the thinking. You can quiet

01:59.360 --> 02:06.120
it down by seeing basically the thinking, the loud thinking, so to speak, is a symptom

02:06.120 --> 02:11.600
of your lack of your proper restraint, not restraining your mind in a proper manner in

02:11.600 --> 02:18.200
a sense of not delighting in the last version of delusion, resisting delusion, resisting

02:18.200 --> 02:23.440
the version and engaging in distraction and delusion. But if you start discerning that,

02:23.440 --> 02:28.200
that's what quiet is the mind down. You can't know, I'm on my mind quiet, I focus on

02:28.200 --> 02:33.240
my nostrils and I'll be quiet. No, you just fall asleep most likely. Or going some

02:33.240 --> 02:38.160
state of like focused attention to something, but again, you just lost the awareness and

02:38.160 --> 02:44.600
the mindfulness completely, which is not different than if you fell asleep. So you want

02:44.600 --> 02:48.560
to see basically that the problem is not in you not trying hard enough to be in the

02:48.560 --> 02:53.880
present moment, which is again, not the matter of choice. The problem is you're not understanding

02:53.880 --> 02:58.720
the nature of intentions enough, but not understanding it, you don't know when they are rooted

02:58.720 --> 03:02.920
in greed or a version of delusion, you have no idea. You're just guessing, sometimes

03:02.920 --> 03:06.600
you guess you're right, sometimes you don't, but you don't see that, which means you're

03:06.600 --> 03:13.440
going to have a very reason. So the mind will quiet down when the physical

03:13.440 --> 03:18.480
restraint and seal has been developed. The verbal, you know, verbal actions are kept in

03:18.480 --> 03:24.480
check. And then mentally, you just don't give, don't give in to the like presented

03:24.480 --> 03:32.800
options of centrality or a version or distraction. If you don't, just don't give in to those.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.160
If they are not those, that's fine. You don't have to be a harmless, be mindful not. You

03:36.160 --> 03:42.080
are already mindful, but not giving in. You're already mindful, mindful, because you're

03:42.080 --> 03:49.600
already abstaining from certain types of mental intention, which are the unwholesome types.

03:49.600 --> 03:56.280
So basically, things you don't do, that's what becomes your present activity in that

03:56.280 --> 04:01.960
negative sense. That's why it's not on a level of doing or on a level of technique.

04:01.960 --> 04:06.360
You can't be doing the abstaining from this thing. No, it's just discerning certain things

04:06.360 --> 04:10.880
that you won't be giving into. Then everything else, it's not those things, that's fine.

04:10.880 --> 04:15.000
That's why the Buddha, even when he was sort of instructing mind's heart to understand

04:15.000 --> 04:19.360
the jhana and establish the mind in jhana, he would say, he would say, don't like fear

04:19.360 --> 04:25.000
every pleasant experience, because they had the attitude of whatever's pleasant is a problem.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.160
It should be dismissed, so they were interfering with things they shouldn't have. Because

04:31.160 --> 04:36.680
if it's agreeable and not deluded in desire or version of delusion, it's not a problem.

04:36.680 --> 04:42.280
And you're assuming that you go away, well it's you overstepping your jurisdiction,

04:42.280 --> 04:47.080
you interfering with that, which is not yours.

04:47.080 --> 04:59.200
So some people might think that locking themselves into a situation of solitude, no distraction,

04:59.200 --> 05:08.080
no TV, it's just being like a prisoner basically, not a jail, solitude, solitude, solitude,

05:08.080 --> 05:19.000
confinement. But most people in that situation go mad, don't stop thinking, no, no, it's

05:19.000 --> 05:25.040
not. Again, if a person knows what they're doing, as in they understand the nature, they

05:25.040 --> 05:30.000
can discern the nature of their, that indirectly, the nature of their intentions, they can see

05:30.000 --> 05:35.840
when they're rooted, then yes, solitude will just result in further clarity. That's

05:35.840 --> 05:40.240
why the Buddha would encourage monks, provided already had the right view and establishment

05:40.240 --> 05:46.480
in sealer and restraint, to go in the jangular remodeling, not socialize, even without

05:46.480 --> 05:54.360
the monks and so on. But if you don't have that knowledge, then well again you might sort

05:54.360 --> 05:59.600
of use it while keeping a notion in your mind that you must develop knowledge. But sometimes

05:59.600 --> 06:04.040
people forget that and then they try to get the circumstances to do the work for them.

06:04.040 --> 06:09.280
So then I'll go for a three-month retreat to burn mine a cookie and people would just bring

06:09.280 --> 06:13.560
me food, I won't see anyone and so on, thinking that that kind of stream solitude will sort

06:13.560 --> 06:18.640
of result in freedom and might be, but you won't. You can only support the knowledge. If

06:18.640 --> 06:22.840
you don't have the knowledge, that's it. You're just staying in the solitude and you will

06:22.840 --> 06:28.880
not necessarily learn from it. Because if the solitude would always result in, then yes,

06:28.880 --> 06:35.200
exactly the solitary confinement prisoners with OBI and Serrana Garnis. But I don't know.

06:35.200 --> 06:43.400
There's been a wave from the found, a wave from unhowsome intentions, long enough.

06:43.400 --> 06:48.120
Well, it's knowledge of what the firements are and unhowsome intentions. That's what

06:48.120 --> 06:55.120
frees you. Being away from them is necessary to an extent to start discerning that knowledge.

06:55.120 --> 07:01.080
But if you have no notion of what that knowledge is, no matter being away from those developments

07:01.080 --> 07:04.400
will approve them. If anything, it would just conceal them further because now you don't

07:04.400 --> 07:10.080
really don't know where to look for them. Because before, there were things kind of, they

07:10.080 --> 07:14.800
would sort of prop the issues up for you and then you would see the issues are still there

07:14.800 --> 07:21.800
and that's how you could judge your work. But in a completely solitary confinement, without

07:21.800 --> 07:30.800
that prior knowledge, now you really don't know where to look or what to do.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.400
So you're getting the strength being the necessary basis.

07:34.400 --> 07:42.080
The strength being the necessary basis, yeah. And usage of solitude to use it to gain the

07:42.080 --> 07:49.080
knowledge, not to use it to avoid the circumstances that bother you and you don't know how to deal with.
