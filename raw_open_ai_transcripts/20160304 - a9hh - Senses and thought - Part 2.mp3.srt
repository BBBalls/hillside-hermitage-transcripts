1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, the thing was, what is choice?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was going to say, what chooses, why do I tend to this site?

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why is there a tension to it?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, that's the same, asking why, it's the same type of question.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I thought you just, you know, in regard to the licenses.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why, and who chooses and stuff, all those assumptions placed in the faith,

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
do you confuse them in regard to choice?

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Because there is choice.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There is choice.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There is a tension.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There is a tension.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And there is intention in regards to you.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If I take it, if I sit by, if I'm aware of myself,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
plus I'm seeing intention,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
thoughts, thinking about, I'm going to do this, do that.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And I'm also seeing what I'm attending to,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
when I'm seeing intention.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's also the better practice to see that.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, it is, but it's separate things.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Most likely that, which you think yourself is in that setup,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
won't be really yourself.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It would be your idea for yourself was,

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
if the time you thought of it.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because yourself, that's what we meant before.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you are able to choose, will, intend,

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
without inducing sense of iron,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
through that choice, will, or intention,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
well, you'll be an online, or, on the way, to be one.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Which is why, again, mindfulness,

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
of breathing on a punasati, is told to sort upon us.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Nobody shorter than that can really understand it,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and do it properly.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But if there is a right view,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
then bringing that sense of,

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am choosing, I am willing,

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I am doing like this, I am doing like that,

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
makes you include yourself always,

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and not exclude, and make it kind of,

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
disappear in the background.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So then, that mindfulness,

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and that discernment, applies to it.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So what you want to do,

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you can't just directly start seeing yourself choosing,

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
because yourself will step outside of that,

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and take it as yours.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In other words, you won't be a sense of self,

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
if you think that's what.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So what you want to do is,

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
recognizing the inevitability of the choice,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
you have to go the indirect way,

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
realize that, well,

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you can but not choose,

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and whatever you do,

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that's choice.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So you're actually not free,

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
in regard to choice.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You might be free to choose what you want,

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
particularly,

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but you're not free to not choose at all.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So in that recommendation,

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that's what it contains,

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the understanding that,

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
even the most volitional act and choice,

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
cannot be actually taken as yours.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Because they fully depend upon it.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, they're given beforehand,

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
as the actual thing,

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
as the possibilities.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can't choose something

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
out of nothingness.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's only that implicit.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Even if it's a Reynolds spontaneous act,

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
it's implicit as such,

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and that's why you could have attended it

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and choose to do it.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Choosing to do it.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So indirectly,

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you have to kind of hollow it out,

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
so to speak,

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
until the thing is not being fed anymore

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
through the false assumption,

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
to the right assumption of,

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I am choosing this.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And then, yet, the choice remains,

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the preferences remain,

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but they're not being fed anymore,

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and they don't spread,

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
they don't proliferate,

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
three minutes.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So it's like a palm stump.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You destroy the roots.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're not modifying choices,

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you're not trimming the branches,

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
like, garnishing the tree or whatever else.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No, you recognize the problem is in the roots.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They are feeding this whole proliferation of their tree.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So you kill the roots.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And then, whatever,

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
whichever way it evolves and grows,

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
it stays,

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and the point is,

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
it won't go further.

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It doesn't matter how it stays.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Which is why our arms can still have habits and stuff like that.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
External habits.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But now we're being fueled

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and fed through the roots

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and free the very illusion.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So when you're fully aware,

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Markful of your body again.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If you're mindful of the body

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
as a thing out there in the world

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because of which your whole experience

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
recognizes,

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and any choice you make,

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
without actually making any specific choice,

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is then included in that.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You realize that,

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
without fire or awareness of mindfulness,

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
it will always remain determined

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
by this living body out there.

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because if the body is dead,

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
this cannot stand.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And that already includes the nature

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
of the choice within that.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So you have to stop like that.

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
When that view gets established,

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
then you have to kind of go within that

131
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and clear out all of the residues inside.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But first you have to start from the outside,

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
which is why it's sort of when it still has conceit

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and so on that he needs to kind of purify later.

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But he doesn't have that general

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
fundamental wrong view.

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So the starting point is that,

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
seeing that with general awareness.

139
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
To general experience,

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the experiences are all seen determined by the body.

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
In the same sense,

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
as we spoke before, the dead body

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
would not be even discernible as such

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
if there is no general experience

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and consciousness in regard to it.

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So it's not that just everything stands upon the body

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and their bodies are living in the world,

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
independent.

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That body, other in the world,

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
is actually determined by this mind

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that depends upon the dead body.

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But, you know,

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
looks and puts on this.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's now a rupamian,

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but as I said before,

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
it's that matter out in the world

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
with the consciousness out there,

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
with that matter

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that your experience exists as such,

160
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
consciousness is not in your head,

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
it's equally external out there.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But the consciousness is out there.

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Where matter is in matter.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So you discern consciousness

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
based on where matter is discerned to be,

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
because that actual matter is inaccessible.

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
As I said before,

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
when you think of the four elements,

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
well, that's your thought.

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It stands for that which four elements is.

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If it actually stands for

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
what the nature of the four great elements is,

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
means you're not conceiving them,

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that thought is the correct thought,

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
thus you have understood,

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
thus they don't find the footing

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in your experience anymore,

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
so you can say the four great elements

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
have ceased in an hour and a half.

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But if your thought,

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the presentation or the Dharma

182
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
of phenomena where you want to call it,

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
stands for something

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that's assumed to be matter.

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In other words, stands wrongly,

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
misrepresent that which is matter.

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That means,

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
are you have conceived it?

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You have conceived the matter.

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The matter found footing,

191
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and that's why the whole world exists for you.

192
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Which is more party answered.

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, but knowing that whatever I think

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
is only a thought.

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, yeah.

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, that matter is unthinkable.

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Knowing that which you think is only a thought

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and the matter is unthinkable,

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and knowing that also is a thought

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that doesn't stand for that matter.

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And that matter,

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that I just said,

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is also a thought.

204
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So any possibility

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and more and more peripheral

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
of the peripheral thought

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
in regard to your current thought

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
or in regard to your current thought

209
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in regard to your earlier,

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
doesn't stand for that matter anymore.

211
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Not just actual thought,

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but the whole peripheral thought

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
doesn't represent it either.

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Then you can say,

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
you've fully approved your buildings.

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You don't conceive of an initial form

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
far near directing.

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Anyhow.

219
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can agree.

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But then, say, well,

221
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
so it's only my head.

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Well, would that, again?

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay, sure. In a way it is all in your head, but would your head be there?

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you are not discerning it, if you are not thinking of it as my head, you wouldn't.

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And then your reckon as well, would it be even able to think any of that?

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If this body, this material body out there is not living and breathing, you wouldn't.

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So then, yeah, it's all in your head, for as long as your body is alive.

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The body is destroyed, the matter is taken away. There is no more head.

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There is no more mind. So I reckon as well, actually, my mind, the experience as a whole,

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
not image-generally mental, whatever, doesn't, it doesn't actually, it's not independent.

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So, and that's usually about statement, it's all in my head, implies.

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Me and everything else, kind of basically, I am the most fundamental.

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But if you recognize, sure, I am most important mental, and then you take that thought

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and recognize it as determined by the fact that matter is there inaccessible.

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But you know, you can know that, because if something happens to that matter, everything is gone.

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And you can know that, and you know that.

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So knowing that long enough, will bring further recognition, and then, even if you have a thought

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
it's all in my head, you don't take that as me and mine.

240
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because you know that's a permanent.

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, everything is thought, yeah.

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And the thought, the nature of thought, is able to manifest itself because matter is there present alive.

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That gets destroyed, which is another thought.

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So, but that's another thought in regard to matter that's present alive, while I'm still alive,

245
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
which is another thought, which is another thought, which, and yeah, it's infinite.

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There is one, because you can never reach a matter.

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But through that infinity, if you want to pursue it or not, you can know, okay,

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm able to go in this any infinite direction, for as long as that which is matter stays.

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If that which is matter gets destroyed, the only thing that is gone, which is what I meant.

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
When I said, how am I going to put it?

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
When eternal, infinite is not confused with permanent and self.

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because infinite, it's like eternity.

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can go forever, for as long as the matter stands.

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The matter is removed, the whole of the matter is gone, inconceivable.

255
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's put myself to come back to compensate myself.

256
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, in a way you do, which is why it has to be taken on artificially,

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
like a graph, as in a bit I said, the right view.

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And then if you do long enough, because, or if, you took it right me,

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and if it corresponds to the way things actually are, then yeah,

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it will take, it will take the proper root, and then you can see it for yourself as being it confirmed.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But you won't see it naturally, because I mean you can find your own way out of ignorance.

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's why it's taken right conviction, that's right view.

263
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But there is the assumption in every protrusion in different degrees,

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
that things will happen naturally.

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You practice, and then you feel this thing unraveling.

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Like, oh, it happened, I got it, or now it's clear.

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Those are kind of very general descriptions, but they usually take it to the wrong thing.

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You want it to happen, you want enlightenment to be found,

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and then it's all an easy ride afterwards.

270
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No, you need to convince yourself.

271
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I said, well, it's not real, if I convince myself.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, what makes you think that your criteria, what's real, what's not real, is correct.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What protrusion I think is real is itself.

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So you might not go so cruelly, and think, oh, I am, I'm in town, or whatever,

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
but still, for as long as you know, it's protrusion of the human.

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You think, this is real, that's not real.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Means, this is more important, that's less important.

278
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Means, I don't actually know, important, that's important,

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
unimportant, is unimportant.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Which is why there was a sort of another verse,

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
says, knowing, important, is important, unimportant, is unimportant.

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Getting that criteria.

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And you get criteria, if you convince yourself, to such an extent,

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the recognition takes place.

285
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So, yeah, there is a form of natural, unveiling, then, but not before.

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Which is why, as I said, the Buddha will always make such exclamations,

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
like a warrior who won by himself,

288
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've done this, like whatever was to be achieved by my manly effort,

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
but my, I've done it.

290
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Nobody else had any input.

291
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No luck, no circumstances.

292
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've made the effort, and I got it.

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I worked through this conviction, until I've seen it.

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And now I'm sure.

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I had faith that the conviction was right, so I was convincing myself.

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Now I've seen it, and it's right, I don't need to convince myself anymore.

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And I certainly don't have faith.

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I have confidence, because I know that it's right.

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Sounds insane.

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sounds fundamentalist. Sounds like mad.

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Which is exactly how Buddha saw it in the first time,

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
when he met the ascetic.

303
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He says, I am self-in-lightened.

304
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Nobody, I absolutely know the teacher.

305
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm the greatest, I'm this, I'm that.

306
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And this was a so big friend, and walked off.

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because he was all true.

308
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, he said, but obviously, then he realized, well, he found to teach.

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I need to find a slightly more relatable approach,

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that will not induce kind of resistance in people.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Thinking you're all conceit, but it's all fact.

312
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So do I.

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That what we had on the monument in Skraj.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I've gone beyond the widows of the river.

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm my own guide.

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Cannot be, cannot be guided.

317
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Not even I don't want to.

318
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's impossible for me to be guided by another.

319
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's that level.

320
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, that's just fundamentalist.

321
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's just wrong.

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's just fixed view.

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Every views are fixed view.

324
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You want to get the right fix.

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So I want to make sure that your convictions are correct,

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
for as correct as they can be.

327
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So you really want to emphasize the discernment, reasoning, reflection.

328
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Because as you can see, you don't really know what you're convincing yourself,

329
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
whether it's right or wrong.

330
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
If it's right, you recognize it.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's right.

332
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You try to respond to the right things and then you'll see through it.

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But if it ain't, it means you're going to wind yourself further and further and further into ignorance.

334
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So yeah, it's a very risky thing.

335
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But you're ignorant anyway.

336
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So not trying it is even more foolish,

337
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
than at least attempting to break out.

338
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It could be a lot of faith to commit the view of our world.

339
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't hold many fixed views.

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, that's a fixed view for you.

341
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They should have fused responsibility for it.

342
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And that's even worse.

343
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, the point is that freedom comes off from it.

344
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There is a...

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's what you can do.

346
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
A form of measuring, once you start practicing, yeah.

347
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
There are some tokens and little hints that can be,

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
okay, I might be on the right way.

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And that's why they wouldn't explain the four stages and the fetters that have been through reviewing those.

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You get the pointers.

351
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, I might flee from doubt.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I would be free from self-view, I would be free from holding onto virtue and duty.

353
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Keep reviewing that.

354
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Understanding what those are means.

355
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You'll be free from that.

356
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
For us, it's keeping in light of those things that are causing suffering.

357
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, no, holding onto the self-use, what causes suffering,

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
well, it makes your mind able to suffer in good ways, trying it.

359
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But you wouldn't be able to say, well,

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
you're kind of trying to practice, look at these things, look at these things.

361
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And then one day, as well, I am...

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is it working?

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, I'm happy enough.

364
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm happier than I was.

365
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah, but are you a centre-party?

366
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't know, but I'm happier.

367
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, exactly.

368
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Which means you settled for less, or basically settled for nothing.

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Because you would know.

370
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's like what is.

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Basically, putugina is in a trend that's about the crash,

372
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and centre-party thinks you are to the crash called together.

373
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Which you just refer to, well, I'm happier,

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
means you just got upgraded in a fancy compartment.

375
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's still going to crash.

376
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So ultimately, it actually makes no difference.

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Which you want to be is out of that training.

378
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's the way you would know it.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Is that something you would know exactly?

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

381
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Because if you have doubt in regard to it, it means up, you know, free from doubt.

382
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Which means that you definitely, not free from that factor,

383
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
which means you cannot be a sort of fan.

384
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Obviously, so you can get people who get so convinced themselves,

385
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
but it's easy to under that.

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You know, you would see the need.

387
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Like, you know, I understood just a challenge of you or two of theirs,

388
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and you'll see the need to maintain the grip on the view.

389
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Because it's existential dependence.

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But then you can't really do much for them,

391
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
because if they were able to convince themselves

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
to let extent to believe something that they're not,

393
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
it means they're deeply rooted into bad faith.

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And the authenticity has to be the first point.

395
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You really want to do it for yourself,

396
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and completely, like, nobody else.

397
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Really, for me, concerning only me.

398
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So, lying to yourself, just so that others will recognize themselves,

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
or lying to yourself through the others by others,

400
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
or, oh, yeah, yeah, like, that's a security in that they're the basic one,

401
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and you will know what you're doing.

402
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And if you're honest in that level, you wouldn't do it.

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Suffering and freedom from it.

404
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's the goal, that's the criteria, that's the measurement.

405
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Nothing else is accepted as compromise.

406
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I told you that when I was back in Serbia,

407
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and then, you know, you go on,

408
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
you get all sorts of Buddhist books and texts or whatever else.

409
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was reading everything.

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And I came across, and then, you know,

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
sort of by my sacrilegomy and contemplating all that.

412
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And then I came across this eye, came article,

413
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
where she says, about sort of the party.

414
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, great.

415
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Because I was just looking for anyone's input.

416
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I wanted to learn more, I think it was before, actually,

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
yeah, way before I came across Nihirah.

418
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And she said,

419
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
oh, we are basically, we are already sort of partners.

420
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's great, very fortunate.

421
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And my first of all was, wow, I'm sort of a partner name.

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So I continue reading, and she says,

423
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
she explains how we're sort of partners.

424
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well, basically, we all know the power into the shrines

425
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and stages in English.

426
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So we are all free from rights and rituals.

427
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Are we? Yeah, yeah.

428
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Show hands, we are.

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Then we all know that

430
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
that the Buddha was right.

431
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So we have no doubt in regards to his teaching,

432
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
he is up to you to accept it.

433
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, we're free from doubt.

434
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And we all know that self doesn't really exist.

435
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Modern science is proven, the molecules are constantly changing.

436
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There is no substance to it.

437
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yep.

438
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yep, we agree.

439
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So we are all sort of partners.

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And they're thinking, okay, I'm a sort of partner.

441
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And then immediately, next thought, well,

442
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
what difference does he make?

443
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If that's what sort of a body is,

444
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
what difference does that make?

445
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't care.

446
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because I wasn't concerned about becoming a sort of partner

447
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
or whatever, I was concerned about being suffering

448
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and free and fluid.

449
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So, sure, you can have the whole Buddhist world

450
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
recognize you as a sort of partner.

451
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
If you are eternally not free from suffering,

452
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
it's irrelevant.

453
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Unless you were never actually about free and fluid suffering,

454
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
but you were about to recognition.

455
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You felt lonely, you felt inadequate,

456
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
you never loved you or whatever else.

457
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But you have to be honest with yourself

458
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and practice for the right reasons.

459
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's what Buddha said.

460
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The downer own has only one taste,

461
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
same like the sea, has the taste of salt.

462
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Downer has the taste of freedom from suffering.

463
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's it.

464
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Can't do it for any other reason.

465
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And why would you?

466
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So, that's exactly the thing.

467
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh, well, yeah, okay.

468
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
According to this, I'm an oven.

469
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What difference does he make?

470
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm not free from suffering.

471
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's what my concern is.

472
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And that's what my athletes are applied to.

473
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But then, obviously, you did what Buddha said.

474
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And so, the one is the one who is free from suffering

475
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
to a great deal,

476
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and those that we see are from pro-number shoots,

477
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and we're just up, I can run.

478
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And then, okay, so if she was wrong,

479
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
it means that the views that she used

480
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
to describe these three factors are also wrong,

481
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
which means, okay,

482
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
so what does really freedom from virtue and duty mean?

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Because, clearly,

484
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
if what I think it means,

485
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
unless that thought makes me so different,

486
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
it makes me so different, and it means that thought is wrong.

487
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So, that's what I meant when I said,

488
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
by understanding what the factors are,

489
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
you abandon them.

490
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There is no discrepancy, there is no delay.

491
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So, would you say that freedom, virtue and duty?

492
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Well, for as long as you think,

493
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
did your good virtue

494
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and sense of duty,

495
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm a monk, I need to meditate, I need to do this.

496
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Any, like the nature of duty,

497
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
the nature of virtue,

498
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
as long as you think,

499
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
as long as you hold that

500
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
to pertain to the practice,

501
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
means you're holding on to it.

502
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Because Dhamma is completely different from that.

503
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
There is no wrongful virtue, Dhamma.

504
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There is no Dhamma without virtue,

505
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
but virtue is not the Dhamma.

506
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
As they said,

507
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
when they were saying,

508
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
what should we recite first?

509
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Story is concerning sealer,

510
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
or the story is concerning the Dhamma.

511
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He said, well,

512
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
there is no Dhamma without sealer.

513
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So, let's recite that first,

514
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and then they decided that the sutra

515
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
to be regarded.

516
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But, they knew the Dhamma is not that.

517
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So,

518
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
it's almost,

519
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
well, what does that mean?

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I can go and do everything.

521
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
No.

522
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You can't do everything

523
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
which you want,

524
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
also, and also, because

525
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
saying that Dhamma is not virtue,

526
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
is not like saying Dhamma is

527
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
un-virtual.

528
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Is that a word?

529
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Un-virtual?

530
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Un-virtuals.

531
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Un-virtuals.

532
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Can you say that?

533
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Anyway, you get it.

534
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Because that's people's assumption.

535
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Good means Dhamma.

536
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But if you say, no,

537
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
there is no wrongful good in Dhamma.

538
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So, Dhamma is bad.

539
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
No, there is no wrongful bad either.

540
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So, that's what means

541
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
dropping,

542
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
thinking about Dhamma.

543
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
People usually translate it

544
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
as rights and rituals.

545
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You can place it down.

546
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Dhamma makes you

547
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
enables you to relate to it.

548
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh, yeah.

549
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Bowing to a shrine doesn't mean anything.

550
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's much softer than that.

551
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Why?

552
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because if stopping,

553
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
if not bowing to a shrine,

554
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
is required to bend in the fetter well,

555
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
most of the monks, well,

556
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
many more would have been so advanced.

557
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But it's softer than that.

558
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's actually

559
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
silver,

560
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,000
butter,

561
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
paramasa.

562
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's silver.

563
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's the same word.

564
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's not a bit from me.

565
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It means virtue.

566
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Virtue and duty.

567
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It feels, again,

568
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
with trying to purify.

569
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But there is no Dhamma without virtue in Dhamma.

570
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Dhamma is not virtue in Dhamma.

571
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But you have to restrain yourself.

572
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Have to restrain yourself first,

573
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and then you might say,

574
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
when you see it,

575
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
you'll see that it's not very strange.

576
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's not very strange either.

577
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Because you can never,

578
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
if you're just straining,

579
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
you'll always be restraining yourself, right?

580
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Because it's not pointed.

581
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
What is there?

582
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, you're straining so much

583
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
where you can never,

584
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
you're so virtuous,

585
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
you don't think anything

586
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
planned there.

587
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And that will,

588
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
that won't result in Dhamma.

589
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But won't you?

590
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That's the thing.

591
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Because people think

592
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
if I'm just virtuous enough,

593
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll see the Dhamma.

594
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Not necessarily.

595
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's a basis.

596
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But if you don't pull anything

597
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
on the basis,

598
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
it remains just a basis.

599
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So what's your

600
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and restrain yourself

601
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
like a raft?

602
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So if you don't use the raft,

603
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
it doesn't mean anything.

604
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah, I suppose, yeah.

605
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I mean, it came like,

606
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
what I think I said that before.

607
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's like a fertile field.

608
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But if you don't pull any seeds,

609
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
it's just a fertile field.

610
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You can't expect,

611
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
you know,

612
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
wrapping the fruit.

613
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
There isn't any,

614
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
because you haven't planted it.

615
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But then eating the fruit,

616
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
yeah, you wouldn't be there

617
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
without the field.

618
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But it's certain.

619
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You're not the soil and the field

620
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and the field,

621
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
because you're eating

622
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
one little bit of the thing.

623
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
There wouldn't be there

624
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
without the field,

625
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
but it's clearly not the field.

626
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
How long does it take

627
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
to become virtuous enough?

628
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
As long as necessary.

629
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Like some people

630
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
can do it, you know,

631
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
you know, in half a night.

632
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So people, like, again,

633
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
some people can do it just after speaking

634
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
with Buddha for a while.

635
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The mind will be virtuous enough

636
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
for them to get a right view.

637
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But that's because

638
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
they would have the right

639
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
destruction

640
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
without any kind of

641
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
frequency and notions

642
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
obstructing it.

643
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's a virtue not to just be straight.

644
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Well, the restraint

645
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
is supposed to bring the state of mind.

646
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Which is the virtue of state of mind.

647
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Virtues and like,

648
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
like, behavior and attitude.

649
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's like a recognition.

650
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh, it's, I've been engaging

651
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
in the virtue of behavior.

652
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's a recognition.

653
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So it does take some time.

654
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So you can get, yeah.

655
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So as I said,

656
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
some people can get established

657
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
upon that recognition quickly,

658
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
upon one virtuous act.

659
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Some people need more.

660
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Today I think most people need

661
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
much more.

662
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Much more time.

663
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, much more of virtuous acts

664
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
in order to get the recognition

665
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
of a phenomenon of virtue

666
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
that you're established upon.

667
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But then if you do practice

668
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
something that goes

669
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
in a completely different direction,

670
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
because if you were and means

671
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
you could do the dharma,

672
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
means there would be

673
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
a set of prescribed,

674
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
rights, rituals, duties,

675
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
methods, techniques,

676
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
with personal retreats

677
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
that could lead you to dharma.

678
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
A mere performance,

679
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
mechanical performance,

680
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
or something could lead you

681
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to the dharma,

682
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
but it can't.

683
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Because dharma doesn't pretend to

684
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
it.

685
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So,

686
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
whatever.

687
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It just,

688
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
why does virtue,

689
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
why does virtue have to

690
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
be the baseline?

691
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Why not?

692
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Why is it relevant?

693
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Why is virtue relevant?

694
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So, is that question relevant?

695
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Anyway, I can answer it.

696
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Back onto the similarly

697
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
of going out on the motorway

698
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
in a pursuering of senses,

699
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
in exposing yourself

700
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
to accidents

701
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
or a chopping block

702
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
or whatever else.

703
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Same note to it,

704
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
by default.

705
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Is it better than saying yes?

706
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If there is a danger

707
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
involved in it?

708
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yes.

709
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So, it's better to say no.

710
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's better to restrain.

711
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's why virtue is better.

712
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because you don't know why,

713
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
but through doing it,

714
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it prevents,

715
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
but it prevents the more immediate

716
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
demise.

717
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Well, you know this trouble

718
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
in that regard you get this.

719
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
If you don't restrain yourself.

720
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah.

721
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Things that could happen.

722
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But it goes,

723
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
it doesn't just concern the

724
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
bodily behavior of those who

725
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
end to the mind.

726
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It works for the mind.

727
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's just subtler,

728
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
but it's the same principle.

729
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
By letting mind go

730
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
onto the domain that doesn't own,

731
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
you're taken by it.

732
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
By saying no,

733
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
it means you remain out of it.

734
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
By remaining out of it,

735
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
it means you can see it eventually.

736
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Not if you're engaged.

737
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That's what Buddha made me say.

738
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
There is no,

739
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
it's impossible to engage

740
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
in a central act without

741
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
having your mind being taken

742
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
by those central perceptions.

743
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You can't,

744
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
or I'm free from

745
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
sensuality yet,

746
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm doing central acts.

747
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Basically,

748
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
it's impossible.

749
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You just cannot,

750
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
cannot occur.

751
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So that's why.

752
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The person who is not

753
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
virtuous,

754
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
means their minds,

755
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
their mind are assumed

756
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
in those domains.

757
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
They can't get a perspective

758
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
on it if he is in it.

759
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's really not jealous.

760
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh, no.

761
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:28,000
There's no question of that.

762
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Then,

763
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
abandoning self identity.

764
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Is that just,

765
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
you have to see self?

766
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yes, it is the first thing.

767
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So when your general behaviour

768
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
is not engaging in things

769
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
that are compromising

770
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
the perspective

771
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
on your general behaviour,

772
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
you can start seeing that,

773
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
well,

774
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
simultaneous kind of determination

775
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
or rather dependence

776
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
of your general behaviour

777
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
upon this random body.

778
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But while you engage

779
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
in random body attacks

780
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
with last version delusion

781
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
without any mindfulness,

782
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
you can't see anything.

783
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Your audio attention is.

784
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yes.

785
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Basically, you sink

786
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
into a hole,

787
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and you can't expect to kind of

788
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
maintain the vision

789
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
of the whole lifestyle.

790
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's just, you can't.

791
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So by restraining first,

792
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
in order to get the perspective,

793
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
you get the perspective.

794
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Then you see the place of restraint.

795
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You see the place of duty,

796
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
which means you don't

797
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
hold onto it,

798
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
blinded anymore,

799
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
which means you're free.

800
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You can see about it,

801
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
but not so.

802
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And then, you don't have to

803
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
be restraining that.

804
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But you will,

805
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
because that's now

806
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
the established normal behaviour.

807
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And also,

808
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
because you recognise

809
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
it's more

810
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
less hassle,

811
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and more pleasant

812
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to be restrained.

813
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Like, the joy of renunciation

814
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
replaces the joy of

815
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
essential indulgence.

816
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But it's again,

817
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
any further you have.

818
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You have to.

819
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Here is our view

820
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
for that.

821
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You can't just

822
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
feel pure restraint.

823
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I mean, you can

824
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
keep telling yourself,

825
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
but you won't take root

826
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
because it's not enough.

827
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But if you get that general perspective,

828
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
you see that

829
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
whatever choice you make

830
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
made will make

831
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
your general experience,

832
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
your experience as a

833
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
hold is fully dependent

834
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
upon this random physical body

835
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
right here,

836
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
right now,

837
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
that's the most

838
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
close to you.

839
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I mean, there's this body,

840
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
there are these bodies.

841
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
There's no difference

842
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
between them.

843
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
There are bodies.

844
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
In those bodies there,

845
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
internally, externally,

846
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
externally, externally,

847
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
in bodies are there.

848
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's just that this particular

849
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
body is closer

850
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
to the general experience as a hold,

851
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
determines it more

852
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
than these bodies.

853
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But none of it can be

854
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
mine to begin with.

855
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So getting that kind of

856
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
perspective

857
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
means good or bad,

858
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
good and bad,

859
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
neutral,

860
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
both,

861
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
whatever,

862
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
it's implemented

863
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
because it's within that,

864
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
cannot escape,

865
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
cannot spill or

866
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
cannot step outside.

867
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So it's completely different

868
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
than just doing good.

869
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's absolutely nothing.

870
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You abandon good.

871
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Inasmuch your abandon

872
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
bad.

873
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But in order to do so,

874
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
you need to be established

875
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
upon good.

876
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And why is it good?

877
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Because at least,

878
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
you don't know why,

879
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
but by doing good,

880
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
no bad means at least,

881
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
you're kind of

882
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
don't step into that domain

883
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
where you fully lose control,

884
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
fully lose perspective,

885
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
fully taking bad.

886
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You don't take the bad,

887
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
basically.

888
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That's why it's good.

889
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Because it says,

890
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
no, you don't even know

891
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that it's bad.

892
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But by adopting attitude

893
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
of saying no to it,

894
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
you don't take it.

895
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And later on,

896
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
you find out that

897
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
there is actually poison in it.

898
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
As a simile,

899
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I just switched to the

900
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
handless engine,

901
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
that the poison is drink

902
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
in terms of the

903
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
essential pleasure.

904
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Pleasant,

905
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
pleasing in every sense,

906
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
side smell,

907
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
texture and everything.

908
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But you know,

909
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
now that there is a poison to it.

910
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Because in the beginning,

911
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
why am I saying no to this?

912
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's just pleasure.

913
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's innocent.

914
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's nice.

915
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's beautiful.

916
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Whatever else.

917
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The whole world does it.

918
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Why do I have to say no?

919
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You don't know that.

920
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Because if you would,

921
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
you'd be free from it.

922
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But you're taking a trust,

923
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
it's better to say no.

924
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And you ask,

925
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
why is it better?

926
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And I say,

927
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
because you don't consume it.

928
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Just,

929
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
you don't know why it's better

930
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
not to consume it.

931
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Later on,

932
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
when you find out,

933
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
you can find out only

934
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
because you haven't been consuming it.

935
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That's the effort that's very strange.

936
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Afterwards, yes.

937
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
After there is no restraint,

938
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
it's understanding,

939
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
which is why I cannot engage

940
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
in a sexual intercourse,

941
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
or any central act.

942
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's just inconceivable.

943
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
He's not restraining himself,

944
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
really kind of trying hard

945
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and after doing it,

946
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and he can't even conceive to do it.

947
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So that's why it's better not to do it.

948
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Then after,

949
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
it becomes self-evident.

950
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
That's sort of how it sees that.

951
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But he still is...

952
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah, he sees that in a general,

953
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
in a fundamental level,

954
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
but in a more particular level,

955
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
he still has more details.

956
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
He still has...

957
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yeah.

958
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
He can fall back into those things.

959
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
To the extent that he can't fall back

960
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
to the point of having a wrong view

961
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
of afterward anymore.

962
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
He can't,

963
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
which is why he's at most seven rivers.

964
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But remember that sort of,

965
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
sometimes it's the second one,

966
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
that's it,

967
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
or the third one, that's it.

968
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Seven at most,

969
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
but not necessarily all seven.

970
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
When it becomes upon landing,

971
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and all those different kind of slightly,

972
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
slightly ambiguous descriptions.

973
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
See, it doesn't even get fully born as human.

974
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's upon landing to be able,

975
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
whatever it means,

976
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
he becomes...

977
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,000
He becomes an island.

978
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So the violence abroad

979
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
doesn't need much to remember again.

980
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Well, he might not...

981
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
He doesn't remember...

982
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He might not remember particular things,

983
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but the principles,

984
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
the potential of the nature of memory,

985
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
are there.

986
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And he just needs to be alive.

987
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And if he's not,

988
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
well, in the next life,

989
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and he's at most seven nights,

990
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
a lot of times,

991
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and those principles,

992
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
we kind of see back into whatever understanding he has.

993
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Well, the natural incline,

994
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
is basically those principles,

995
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
are what he is.

996
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So, yeah,

997
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
it will inevitably,

998
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
because that's the direction he is.

999
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So,

1000
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
when he wants to do this,

1001
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
he'll be going that way,

1002
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
eventually.

1003
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And no matter how,

1004
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
in doubt, he can get,

1005
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and careless,

1006
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
it's all, like,

1007
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
just nothing,

1008
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
in comparison.

1009
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
He will arrive there.

1010
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But, yeah?

1011
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
There is still some work to be done,

1012
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
so there's no excuse for not doing it.

1013
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Which is why the boy would be urging,

1014
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Saikas,

1015
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to become an aunt,

1016
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
says,

1017
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
if there wouldn't be any work,

1018
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I wouldn't be telling him,

1019
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
going to the work,

1020
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
but because there is,

1021
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
there's no need to do it.

1022
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So,

1023
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the thing,

1024
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm going to show you,

1025
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
gaining perspective,

1026
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
that this general awareness,

1027
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
depends on this,

1028
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
his particular body,

1029
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and then doing that,

1030
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and then seeing that,

1031
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
is it,

1032
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
well, you,

1033
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
not entirely,

1034
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
if you're suffering,

1035
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
but there's a major shift,

1036
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
you know,

1037
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
it's longer,

1038
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
it's subject to it,

1039
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
something,

1040
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
then you have no doubt,

1041
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
if it goes

1042
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
to what you've been doing,

1043
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
at the same time.

1044
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You know,

1045
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
once it works,

1046
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
so there's different,

1047
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
it's gone,

1048
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
once it works.

1049
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And then you can't even conceive,

1050
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and the idea of a pamiro,

1051
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
existing,

1052
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
upon anywhere else,

1053
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
different,

1054
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
from your general experience,

1055
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
as a whole,

1056
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
depending upon this material,

1057
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
organs,

1058
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
which is also part of general experience,

1059
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
as a whole,

1060
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
as a form of designation,

1061
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
these organs.

1062
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Just like that,

1063
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
change where,

1064
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
the general awareness,

1065
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
how is that happening?

1066
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
That's just an attention

1067
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
to the whole.

1068
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Well, it's not happening,

1069
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
it's already there.

1070
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You start back into it,

1071
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
you recognize it.

1072
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The only reason you can reflect,

1073
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
is because there are,

1074
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
the nature of reflection is possible.

1075
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
If there wouldn't be a place,

1076
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
so,

1077
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
it's not something else.

1078
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's not something,

1079
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
one, you do it,

1080
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
by intending to go

1081
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
that direction,

1082
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but that direction exists,

1083
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
that's what your experience is.

1084
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So, general,

1085
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and particular,

1086
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
actual and peripheral,

1087
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
peripheral,

1088
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
in general,

1089
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
that's already there.

1090
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We're so used to being observed

1091
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
in what's taking your attention,

1092
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
actually, but now,

1093
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
directly,

1094
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
you don't see peripheral,

1095
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
then you wonder,

1096
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
how this peripheral comes,

1097
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
no, that peripheral

1098
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
is the basis for actual.

1099
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And in the same sense,

1100
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
that peripheral is determined,

1101
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
but then, which is not peripheral,

1102
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
it's peripheral to this.

1103
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So, recognizing the phenomenon

1104
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
of that peripheral means

1105
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
developing mindfulness.

1106
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Like, let me how to see

1107
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
without shifting

1108
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the original direction.

1109
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Let me how to see peripherally.

1110
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Because if I'm trying to do it,

1111
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
that's it.

1112
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Well, if you try to do it,

1113
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
if you're intending,

1114
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
or are they over intending

1115
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
in this case,

1116
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
means you just shift

1117
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
onto the new actual,

1118
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
which means now peripheral

1119
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
is different,

1120
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and you're not seeing it.

1121
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So, you see it

1122
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
in the garden,

1123
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
what you're seeing,

1124
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
which is a form of seeing,

1125
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
an indirect wear of seeing,

1126
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
which is equally valid

1127
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
where you're seeing.

1128
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You just got so used,

1129
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
that staring directly,

1130
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
to that became the norm

1131
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
of existence and reality.

1132
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And if something is not there,

1133
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
it doesn't exist.

1134
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's a real.

1135
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
In general awareness,

1136
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
you said that,

1137
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
what is another term for that word?

1138
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What do you mean?

1139
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I can't say,

1140
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
do we have to flick mindfulness?

1141
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
What does mindfulness

1142
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
mean to we have to flick mindfulness?

1143
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
In general awareness,

1144
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
we set what is the

1145
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
another term for that word

1146
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
which we mean?

1147
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
We have to flick mindfulness.

1148
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
We have to flick mindfulness.

1149
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
What do you mean?

1150
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Like I say, we have to reflect mindfulness.

1151
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Mindfulness is present.

1152
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So it's conscious.

1153
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah, and that's right.

1154
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Mindfulness is established.

1155
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And you don't establish it by going from the deep inside of your head or whatever else.

1156
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You establish it by recognizing your general experience very well,

1157
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
and I will speak fully determined by this positioned matter of your body on that chair,

1158
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
while we're speaking, while you're asking these questions.

1159
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That body remains there seated, or whichever situation it's in.

1160
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And you have no control over the material aspect of that.

1161
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I mean, you have no control to such an extent that you can't even think matter.

1162
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You can think in regard to that which matter is.

1163
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And in that which you think the matter is in regard to which you're thinking,

1164
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that's also a thought.

1165
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That's how inaccessible elements are.

1166
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And consciousness is out there with an equally inaccessible.

1167
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And then you realize that whatever comes as a result of conscious matter,

1168
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
namely feeling perception intentions are equally inaccessible.

1169
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So my sense of myself, me, volition, intention, determination, and of mine,

1170
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
inconceivable to be mine.

1171
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Which is, remember we spoke about it a few days ago,

1172
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and said, well, it's so fundamentally inconceivable that, as I said,

1173
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
it's actually nothing to grieve over.

1174
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's impossible to even conceive an ocean of grief, sadness, over it.

1175
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Which is why, in that rudiment of the Buddha said,

1176
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
there is the unborn, the un...

1177
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
The unborn, the undetermined, the...

1178
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
All of those, like, there is.

1179
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And that's that inaccessible thing.

1180
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Because if there wouldn't be, mebana is inaccessible.

1181
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's real.

1182
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
In every experience, in experience of a Buddhist,

1183
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
no Buddhist pathogen, I don't, mebana is there.

1184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's just why it's fully understood or not.

1185
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
If there wouldn't be inaccessible, means access would be there.

1186
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And freedom from it would not be possible.

1187
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But because there is an inaccessible, freedom from anything that you could have access before is possible.

1188
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And accessible is anything that appears.

1189
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Means you can access it, you can take it, you can appropriate it.

1190
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Hence, both age and death and so on.

1191
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
As a result of it.

1192
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But if you fully understand that it's rooted

1193
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
upon something you can't even think.

1194
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And you know that, means you know what inaccessible is,

1195
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,000
without conceiving it in your thoughts.

1196
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's absolutely like no room for emotion, it's just inconceivable.

1197
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Which is why it doesn't feel anything.

1198
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And that's how as well.

1199
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
You can resolve upon that with wisdom long enough to become an event.

1200
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Because if you keep that image long enough, correctly,

1201
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
without conceiving it, all of the factors will fall away.

1202
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Which is what sacred is supposed to do.

1203
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Not me, not mine, not I am.

1204
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Not ecstasy here, not ecstasy there.

1205
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Not assuming ecstasy, not ecstasy there.

1206
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
That's what the element of nibbana, like nibbana dot, that's what it means.

1207
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It's there as a possibility, as an element.

1208
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It needs to be understood.

1209
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yes, it needs to be understood.

1210
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And that's why you can conceal it as well.

1211
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And there's other symptoms.

1212
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It says, he thinks, oh, I am nibbana, I am entering nibbana.

1213
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That which he refers to is actually nibbana.

1214
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But he's not entering it or attaining it because he's thinking, I am.

1215
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
He's conceiving it.

1216
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So it's nothing magical, it's nothing hidden in that sense.

1217
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Like, what you have is pathogen, it's five aggregates.

1218
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
What she has done, it's five aggregates.

1219
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's within that that the whole dumbbells can think.

1220
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It basically pertains to the way you take them or not.

1221
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The five aggregates.

1222
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And you take them, for as long as you don't fully understand

1223
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
that there is impossible to take them in the first place.

1224
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
They are inaccessible.

1225
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Not knowing they're inaccessible, you access them through that lack of knowledge.

1226
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So there is no room for it, but it has always been there.

1227
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So it's beginningless, but actually it's not supposed to be there.

1228
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It's not needed, it's not necessary.

1229
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's a parasite, isn't it?

1230
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But beginningless.

1231
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's something you knew before, because if you knew before,

1232
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
you couldn't have fallen onto this not knowing.

1233
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Because once you know, you cannot not know anymore.

1234
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So this lack of knowledge is beginningless yet completely exaggerated.

1235
00:47:46,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Not knowing they're inaccessible, that's it.

1236
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And with general mindfulness, we can begin to recognize the conducts are inaccessible.

1237
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Well, you recognize that any thought, any notion, any thought, any designation,

1238
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
no matter how subtle, how minimal, how general, how ambiguous,

1239
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you recognize it as such, but you recognize it as such.

1240
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You don't take it to stand, you don't take it to access that which is inaccessible,

1241
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
which is back onto the principle of meditation I was telling you about before,

1242
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
whatever arises you included.

1243
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You recognize it as such, and that's what I mean.

1244
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
When you say, ah, the matter is inaccessible, that thought of that inaccessible matter

1245
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
is also your thought, which you then think that matter to be,

1246
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
so that matter has access to you or you access the matter.

1247
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
So he conceives in matter, matter in me, I'm in matter, I'm in matter,

1248
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm right, he conceives matter.

1249
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But if you know that matter is inaccessible, and then that thought doesn't stand for that which matter is,

1250
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and that thought that says that which matter is also doesn't stand for that which matter is,

1251
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
and that design to it.

1252
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So you leave that whole infinite kind of domain,

1253
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
as well, sorry, you don't leave it, but you kind of understand that whole infinite domain

1254
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
is basically inaccessible.

1255
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It cannot access matter, matter cannot access it.

1256
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
No matter how far you go, what next thought comes,

1257
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
it cannot stand for that which matter is,

1258
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
because that's another thought of matter,

1259
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
it can stand for what matter is.

1260
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So you realize whatever I think, quickly or slowly,

1261
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm bigurously, it will be under lower thought.

1262
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Thus, that which matter is cannot manifest itself in my thought,

1263
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
because what I think are my thoughts,

1264
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
which is why, what I perceive in my perception, what I feel in my feelings,

1265
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I don't feel my thoughts, I don't perceive my feelings.

1266
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
That confusion means confusion in regard to the basic nature of phenomena.

1267
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
So it needs to be clarified to that point when what I'm saying now can make more sense.

1268
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But if you think matter, you direct your matter, that's a thought.

1269
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You recognize, no matter how far it goes,

1270
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
you recognize it within the domain of thought.

1271
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Next thought still shares the same nature of thought.

1272
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And you get to understand that,

1273
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
when you start concerning yourself with nature of things,

1274
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
as opposed to with particularity of things,

1275
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
so you don't care what you think your care of thought is there.

1276
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You don't care what you see, your care of sight is there.

1277
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You start recognizing the nature of things,

1278
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
but being established in a nature of thought,

1279
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
nature of the thought domain,

1280
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
which is basically nature of everything,

1281
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
means whatever you think will be seen in its nature,

1282
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
which means it will be seen in its rising,

1283
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
seizing and persisting while changing for as long as it's persisting.

1284
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But it will not be confused,

1285
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
it will not be assumed to stand for that,

1286
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
which is outside of the domain of thought.

1287
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And even the thought outside of the domain of thought

1288
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
cannot actually be outside of the domain of thought,

1289
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
because it's also not a thought.

1290
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So you can't step outside of it, inconsirable.

1291
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The world has been mindful of that nature of thought.

1292
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You have to recognize it,

1293
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
you have to do it at the same time to see this.

1294
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Well, no, it rises on its own.

1295
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
You didn't create that thought.

1296
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So if you recognize it to the extent which has a reason,

1297
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
you're not adding anything to it.

1298
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
There is no assumption to it,

1299
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
you're not taking anything away from it.

1300
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So that's why, by contemplating,

1301
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
sort of not even the bodhisattva,

1302
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
previous Buddha we've passed before,

1303
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
he became the Buddha.

1304
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
While he was the bodhisattva,

1305
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
he recognized that, and then all he'd done

1306
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
was contemplating arising,

1307
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
manifesting, arising, appearance,

1308
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and disappearance,

1309
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
persisting or changing in regard to five aggregates,

1310
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
things in their arising,

1311
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
things manifesting in their arising,

1312
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
things manifesting in their seizing.

1313
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And that's it.

1314
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
He'd done that long enough,

1315
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
he became some Samboda,

1316
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
and the same principle works for anybody

1317
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
who wants to become an Arant.

1318
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Because things do arise on their own.

1319
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
If they weren't,

1320
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
it means you would be the master.

1321
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
That's it.

1322
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
That's the fact.

1323
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
If you recognize feeling, I say that's just a thought.

1324
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, yeah, feeling is mental.

1325
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But if you say that's just a thought,

1326
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
as opposed to what else?

1327
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
What else is not just a thought?

1328
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Even just a thought is just a thought.

1329
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Yes, well, I mean,

1330
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
it's a thought.

1331
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Well, everything is a thought, that's a thought.

1332
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So instead of that's just a thought,

1333
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
no, that's a thought.

1334
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Which means, mastering your thoughts,

1335
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
you'll be an Arant.

1336
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And finding out there is a suit that says it.

1337
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But you don't master your abstract scholarly proliferation thoughts.

1338
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You master the phenomenon of thoughts.

1339
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Because everything is mental in that sense.

1340
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You wouldn't be able to discern anything

1341
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
if it doesn't kind of pertain to your mind.

1342
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You might come from different directions,

1343
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
but that's where you know it.

1344
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
You just couldn't.

1345
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So feeling is mental.

1346
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
So you say whatever...

1347
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Well, mental means...

1348
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Mental means it's a phenomenon.

1349
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's a phenomenon.

1350
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That's what my mind is.

1351
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
The domain of the phenomenon is what chiptages.

1352
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And when the Buddha asks,

1353
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
well, what are those dummies?

1354
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I think it's the Father like it.

1355
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
What else can it be?

1356
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
What are those circumstances?

1357
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It's the Father like it.

1358
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:24,000
What else can it be?

1359
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So if you use thought to describe your discursive thinking proliferation,

1360
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
then you shouldn't use the same word to describe this.

1361
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You could refer to this as phenomenon or a mental image.

1362
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And everything is a mental image.

1363
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to discern it as anything.

1364
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It would not manifest.

1365
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So the mental image of this is just thought.

1366
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
It's a mental image.

1367
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Or this is just a thought.

1368
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So thoughts are mental images.

1369
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Perceptions are mental images.

1370
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Feelings are mental images.

1371
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Or thoughts are dummies.

1372
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Feelings are dummies.

1373
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Perception are dummies.

1374
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It's a phenomenon.

1375
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's a contemplating arising and falling.

1376
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
You're a contemplative arising and falling of mental images.

1377
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yeah.

1378
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
The experience as a whole is in foundations.

1379
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It has a reason.

1380
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Basically, arising is already existing or changing.

1381
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's just increasing in its presence.

1382
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But increasing, like fading in, means up.

1383
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It's already changing while it's increasing.

1384
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So the three kinds of arising,

1385
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
persisting or arising, ceasing,

1386
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and persisting while changing,

1387
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
cool understood and so on,

1388
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
what they're supposed to talk about.

1389
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It's not like three things in a sequence.

1390
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And it's certainly not what people,

1391
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
the many others say,

1392
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
arising, persisting while changing, ceasing.

1393
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
That's like a linear observation of something

1394
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
that fully pretends to time,

1395
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
something that you can measure.

1396
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Oh, it started.

1397
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Now it's lasting.

1398
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Now it's gone.

1399
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And I'm fully out of it.

1400
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
No.

1401
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Arising is already the persisting or changing.

1402
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Ceasing is already the persisting or changing.

1403
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
So it's just like fading in and fading out,

1404
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
while it's persisting or changing,

1405
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
so it's on two completely different levels.

1406
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Arising and ceasing is on one level,

1407
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
persisting or changing is another level.

1408
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So that already means you cannot not include yourself

1409
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
in that form of contemplation.

1410
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So if your general experience as a whole

1411
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
is arising in a certain way,

1412
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
it's persisting while changing.

1413
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And if you're aware of that,

1414
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
well, you're aware of you being within that.

1415
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Oh, this is arising for me,

1416
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
or to me, or left of me, or right of me.

1417
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Well, it's all persisting while changing

1418
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and you're mindful of that.

1419
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And then in the same sense when something is fading away,

1420
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
it's still there.

1421
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It's still a form of appearance.

1422
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That's what I mean.

1423
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You won't find it permanent at the end of the thing.

1424
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
That's just another thing there.

1425
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You'll find it within the appearance,

1426
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
within the persistence of that thing.

1427
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You'll find that's why it's impermanent,

1428
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
because it persists on its own.

1429
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Sadly...

1430
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Can you just hold up?

1431
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So...

1432
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Yeah.

1433
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
If you had a battery,

1434
00:57:40,000 --> 00:58:03,700
So you can practice this whole thing in regard to get on body right here right now, which

1435
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:09,200
has a position it is, because when you think of my body is seated, you think that stands

1436
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:15,520
for that matter which your body is, and that's already a form of conceiving. So you want

1437
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,880
to have a thought, because you can't but not think. So you want to have a thought that

1438
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,600
my body is seated, but then you want to leave that thought to be, to the extent that it

1439
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,560
wants to be. In other words, you have to recognize it phenomenologically the way it has a reason.

1440
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:37,760
If you do, then it will not be conceiving that because of which that thought is, which

1441
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,400
is the four great elements. That's what I was writing in the term determination, that

1442
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,000
because of which, because if I use the direct term, people would just think, ah, that's

1443
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,280
it, but no, that's another thought. By saying that because of which that thought is, standing

1444
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,720
for that because of which that thought is, means, oh, you just conceived that matter because

1445
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,880
of which your thought is, including the idea of what that matter is. So just think of

1446
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,200
a body posture, but don't think that to be that element, that because of which a body

1447
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:15,080
posture is, so leave or rather imply that matter as inaccessible. And then when your

1448
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:19,960
thoughts are, that matter is inaccessible, that is not accessing in either, that thought.

1449
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,440
So you peripherally become more mindful. So you don't have to think about anything else

1450
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,680
really in terms of collecting all the data and information and mapping it all out. It's

1451
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:39,800
right here. So remain mindful of the four body postures correctly without them assuming

1452
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:45,080
the four great elements, without your material organs standing for that because of which those

1453
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:53,240
material organs are. And you will not access that matter. Yet you'll be, you'll be knowing

1454
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:59,920
it, so to speak. Because you know that this body, this experience as a whole, is determined

1455
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:06,880
by that because of which it's already there. Because if a body determined, it would have

1456
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:17,680
been here already arisen. But then you stop assuming the existence of those determinations.

1457
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,720
Which is another way of saying, you stop having those thoughts then standing for that because

1458
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:27,080
of which your thoughts were in the first place. And that's what it means that cessation

1459
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:33,800
of all this encounters. And determinations don't exist anymore. There's nothing to determine

1460
01:00:33,800 --> 01:01:02,320
because there's nothing to access in the first place.

1461
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:13,720
But body posture, let's just, when I say body posture, the thoughts of the image of my

1462
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:21,520
body, the sight of my body sitting here. What does every posture have in common? What

1463
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,920
is the image of every posture has in common? The image of the body. Yeah. Which is why we

1464
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,600
can just be mindful of the body is there to the extent necessary for the final knowledge.

1465
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:39,880
But always the posture in itself is generally enough. But yeah, it's not the fundamental.

1466
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:45,400
But the reason why it's good to think of posture because it will keep that mental element,

1467
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:54,080
so to speak. It will kind of allow you to not become fully complacent in conceiving the

1468
01:01:54,080 --> 01:02:01,360
image of your body as there which your body is. Because posture is sort of a designation.

1469
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, it's a shape, it's a position of your body, but it's also a designation. Seated

1470
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,800
for mental designation, which means, oh, it's always there because even knowing the body

1471
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,800
to the extent necessary for the final knowledge, that image of the body is already a mental

1472
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,920
designation. And that's, that's, there was no other problem. You just, what the problem

1473
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,960
was, when that designation stood for that because of which that designation was in the first

1474
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:33,040
place, stood for matter, stood for for greater, stood for the five aggregates, which is why

1475
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:40,280
you take up five aggregates like the fire takes up its fuel. But they, they could, they don't

1476
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:57,800
need you. They could be exist without you anyway. Or you can just be in less particular

1477
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:03,880
and be mindful of your bodily posture while you're doing other things. And then just

1478
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,360
regard that image of your bodily posture upon which you're anchored, mindful as subject

1479
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:15,360
to destruction. And you can't do anything about it. Because that image is generally subject

1480
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:20,040
to destruction. And that image is generally the determination for your, whatever else

1481
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:24,440
particular things you're doing while you're mindful of that, means whatever you're doing

1482
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:31,680
while you're mindful of that, which is subject to destruction, you won't fully appropriate.

1483
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,280
You will remain mindful of it. Why? Because if I tell you, okay, when you go walk about

1484
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:41,480
your day, do stuff, but in any, in the next minute, there might be a bullet flying through

1485
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:49,880
your brain from some direction. Okay. So you will be going about your business eventually.

1486
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:55,480
This will always be in the back of your mind. You're subject to death because if you were

1487
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:02,240
not subject to death, he wouldn't be possible for that you would arise as a possibility.

1488
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:09,200
So by, exactly, by contemplating right things, correct things as impermanent as you will

1489
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,400
abandon everything else. Not by just applying blank, oh, it's all impermanent, it's all

1490
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,880
changing now, it's all, that's irrelevant. But you want to see as impermanent, doesn't

1491
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,960
mean that you see it's destruction because if you were to see destruction in your body,

1492
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,840
well, you wouldn't see it, you'll be destroyed. You want to see it as subject to destruction.

1493
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:31,280
Which means it's there, it's manifested, it's present because of that, it's subject

1494
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:49,560
to be destroyed. And seeing things subject to such and such means, seeing things in their

1495
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:56,960
nature. So be mindful, generally experienced as a whole, while you're aware of your body

1496
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:04,960
right here, right now in this particular posture, there is, like fundamental kind of

1497
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,600
pure thought point of your whole general experience, you would be inconceivable if this body is

1498
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:14,280
not alive, it's that simple. So you're mindful of that alive body in this particular

1499
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,800
posture, in that particular posture is something that on that level, not only on the level of

1500
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:27,600
your thought, but do you think about it or not, it remains subject to be destroyed. That's

1501
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:33,360
what it means, you think of it on that level. Oh, whether I think about this or not, even

1502
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:39,920
when I forget, it makes no difference to that nature, it remains subjected to destruction,

1503
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:50,240
it's in that domain, and nothing you can do about it. And that will be a problem of mindfulness,

1504
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:55,840
the results in discernment and wisdom, not, you know, be here now and have a tree and feel

1505
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:12,000
good about yourself. No, abandon everything, abandon the ship before it sinks away.

1506
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:37,200
And even if things are happening too fast, busy, crowd, you can't, like follow, well, which

1507
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,240
you're not supposed to do from the beginning, follow things particularly, but be even more

1508
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,000
aware of what's happening particularly. You still know the body is there, and that's

1509
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,720
the reason why all these things can happen in the first place, the body is there, which

1510
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:53,880
is subject to destruction and peril, which means, well, whatever is happening right here

1511
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:59,040
right now, it's kind of circumstantial, it could have not been, and certainly will not

1512
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:05,960
be. And that's another reason why the whole contemporary

1513
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:11,480
bustle is just so wrong, it's completely the opposite direction from what I'm just saying.

1514
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:16,560
Instead of looking in the general image of your body, then if you're trying to force,

1515
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:22,480
it's kind of constant, actual direct perception of body moving, touching, touching, sitting,

1516
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,680
sitting, drinking, drinking, like absorb, absorb yourself in the moment as hard as you can.

1517
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,800
And that's completely the other way. You don't want, well, you're not bothered about

1518
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:40,480
being absorbed or not. You want to maintain the background image of a body, that determines

1519
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:47,560
your absorption or lack of it, that determines it, that body which is subject to destruction.

1520
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:53,800
So hence is absolutely no method or technique or subtle mechanical repetition that can

1521
01:07:53,800 --> 01:08:05,800
take you in a direction, that's a recognition, it's a formal understanding.

1522
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:23,840
I've seen the body there, but it's certainly the body there, because it's already there,

1523
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,000
there's a general awareness, but it's seen there, that body there is, the general awareness

1524
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,200
order implies the body there, then you discern the body there, as that is the way the general

1525
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,680
awareness is possible in the first place. But by doing that, I'm going to include in my

1526
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:48,200
salvation. That's the thing, but doing that, you leave no room for yourself to step outside

1527
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:53,320
and be excluded. So include everything, so whatever yourself, yourself tries to move,

1528
01:08:53,320 --> 01:09:05,640
it will be within that room. And you can't do that, but by trying to reach the most general

1529
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,560
thought, they will kind of hold over the other thought, because there's more general to

1530
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:16,640
that then. But you do that by seeing that any thought, no matter how far it goes, or how

1531
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:24,440
particularly absorbed the focus is, is determined, but this position body out there, that's

1532
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:33,240
subject to destruction. That's one matter and body, is the interchangible, it's the same

1533
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:39,760
word, often it was interchangible, it will refer to as matter as the matter of your body,

1534
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:47,000
it will refer to Rupa, because it is in Kaya, but inconceivable there's a Rupa, and often

1535
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:53,240
that's the Rupa, you know. But not the actual Rupa, because the actual Rupa is inaccessible,

1536
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:58,600
the four elements, inaccessible, but that's the closest proximity I was talking in relation

1537
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,760
to, like, all these four bodies. So it was often referred to in the same word as you

1538
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:26,360
would refer to the matter. So whatever, even if your thoughts of confusion, you can't make

1539
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:33,360
it a lot, you can think that while you're in this body's position here is such determining

1540
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:38,760
the durability to think that in the first place, and that body is subject to destruction,

1541
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,860
and you know that. In the beginning you might have to think about it more, but after

1542
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:46,360
a while it just becomes implicit in that image of that body, which means your mindfulness

1543
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:54,360
gets established quicker, more properly, more skilled. So it's not about changing what

1544
01:10:54,360 --> 01:11:05,360
is a reason, it's just recognizing the inherent undermining structure of that. And that's

1545
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:12,960
it, it's undermining, it can't access it directly, that which undermines you, because if you

1546
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,440
would, it means you would be undermining it, it would be undermining you. So it's always

1547
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:26,440
below your feet, undermining you. So you recognize that, it means, well, you're not going

1548
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:32,440
to hold anything, that's being undermined. And then you're also real as well, actually,

1549
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:39,120
yeah. I was not supposed to hold this at all from the start, because it was never used

1550
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:51,120
to begin with, because if it were used, it wouldn't have been undermined. And I'm always

1551
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:59,120
there when I'm discerning the body or being mindful of by recognizing the nature of the

1552
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,120
body subject to destruction. You include that, yeah, because you can never include directly

1553
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:12,120
your sense of self. You can't own me, I'm subject to this, no, except it kind of slides

1554
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,120
somewhere else, your sense of self. So then what you're thinking is your sense of self,

1555
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:22,120
it's not. So you can only approach it indirectly. So, oh, there is me in this general experience,

1556
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:27,120
I'm sitting here, I'm breathing, I'm doing this, I'm doing that while this seated body

1557
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:35,120
remains on the chair, fully subject to destruction. And then that self that you will be experienced

1558
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:41,120
is not self. That's why automatically. So if you recognize correctly implements and

1559
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:48,120
suffering, you don't then do, oh, so this is my not self. No, then your experience as a

1560
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:54,120
whole is automatically the experience of not self. You do that long enough, you will recognize

1561
01:12:54,120 --> 01:13:00,120
that it's, that's what not self is. By recognizing what's really not self, well,

1562
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:05,120
you'll stop holding your view of yourself. So you become sort of one who is free from

1563
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:14,120
art of art, which is not recognizing what actually not self is. So for as long as you see

1564
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,120
the not self in front of you means, ah, you excluded your sense of self, ah, which means

1565
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:25,120
that's not not self. But if you do it, it's just what you said, when you general experience

1566
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,120
as all whatever you are doing, I'm sitting here talking, whatever else, while my body,

1567
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:34,120
while this material body is seated, completely subject to destruction from any direction and

1568
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:40,120
I absolutely cannot even foresee it happening. I just know that it's subject to it.

1569
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:49,120
Automatically, whatever I do, while I have that perception established, will be non self.

1570
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:54,120
Which is exactly, see how hard it is because it's not the hard once you recognize it,

1571
01:13:54,120 --> 01:14:00,120
then you know what to look for. If you had the utterance of another explaining it,

1572
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:04,120
sufficient enough, but you can see one over, it can become another and you'll even

1573
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:10,120
see another one by accident. Because you can't recognize, like many people can do this.

1574
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:17,120
Oh, you see this subject, but you can't do it long enough. You can accidentally do it once or twice or three times.

1575
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:22,120
But you can't accidentally repeat it thousands of times, which is the number of times most likely

1576
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:29,120
required for somebody to recognize that as a principle. So that's why the effort,

1577
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:35,120
the effort, the effort, the repetition and so on. That's what practice is about.

1578
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:41,120
Recognize what you're supposed to discern and then keep doing it, and keep doing it,

1579
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,120
and keep doing it. Without somebody telling you, you're supposed to do that.

1580
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:50,120
It's impossible to do it thousands of times. You just can't.

1581
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,120
Hence you can't stumble upon it by a chance. Oh, yeah.

1582
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:01,120
It was a fortunate night. It was just like that. It all happened. I'm so lucky.

1583
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:06,120
It doesn't work like that. If it did, it's because you spend the whole night doing this work.

1584
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:12,120
And then you know, I've done it. And for that very reason, it cannot be taken away.

1585
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:18,120
It didn't come through any external circumstance, nothing. Not given, cannot be taken away.

1586
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:23,120
Recognized as already there. And because it's already there,

1587
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:29,120
there is nothing to do with it. That's why everybody refers to it as an ancient part.

1588
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,120
And I could reveal it again, but it was there. Because if you weren't there,
