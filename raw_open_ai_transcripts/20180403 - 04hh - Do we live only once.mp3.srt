1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So some people say that we only live once, so we must enjoy our lives to the fullest.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Do whatever makes us happy.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Go after our desires, try to achieve what we want to achieve.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We enjoy our lives to the fullest.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's the idea.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's okay.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Good late.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, if you're an authentic person, I mean many people say that as a formal dismissal,

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
are you only live once?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There's nothing you can say to them, but say people start doubting that notion of you only live once.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The fact is you don't really know how many times you live.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So as simple as that, you can't know.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You cannot know.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There are people who believe, they live only once.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There are people who believe that you live many times.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There are people who believe you live twice, such as rebirth in heaven or hell and that's it.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But the point is, it's always going to remain a matter of belief.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So if you're somebody who is trying to help yourself in an ultimate manner,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
who want to develop your mind and so on, you have to recognize that and admit

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that it's always going to be a matter of belief.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So when you're sure, when you feel completely confident in saying you live only once,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
well, that's not true.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Because you don't know, for sure, yet you've been sure based upon a mere belief.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a big mistake.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a very risky thing to do.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So I'm not saying you should stop believing whatever you believe.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm just saying you have to recognize that it is a belief and it cannot be more than that.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So from that point of view, then you recognize, well, what is the safest belief I can have?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Like, if I live only once, if I believe that, okay, sure.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then as a result of that belief, I end up behaving in this life whichever way I want.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But what if you live more than once?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And then because of your bad behavior in this life, you end up paying the price.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because those people who do believe in future lives, be Christians or Buddhist or Hindus,

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
they believe that you're going to be able, accordingly, to your actions.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Even Christians, like if you're not a good Christian, having those will be close to you.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So you recognize that, okay, so the belief of more lives requires a certain degree of good behavior.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
In a sense, if you don't behave well, your future lives, they're going to be very compromised.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So that's all you have to do. You don't have to go further and you have to look for a proof.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You just have to recognize it. It's a belief.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And as such, the best belief for you to adopt is the one that's safest in a long run.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
As with everything else in the life, you don't want to think just for tomorrow.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, I'll just steal this today. Enjoy the money.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Enjoy the money I stole tomorrow, and then they have tomorrow going to go to jail for the rest of my life.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's a very unwise thing to do.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So in the same manner, you recognize there might be only one life, there might be more lives.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But I should assume that there are more lives in case that there are more lives,

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and then I end up paying the price for my misbehavior in this life.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And that's it. And it's not exactly that you need to relinquish this life in order to gain heaven in future lives.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You just have to not behave like an animal in this life.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's it. You just have to have a degree of virtue.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's what everybody agrees upon.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So what is the safest route for you to go?

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's basically to believe that there are probably more lives just in case.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If they're not so bad, you behave well in this life.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
People praise you. People you were trustworthy.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They trusted you. They were never laid down, but you were not a scoundrel,

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
not stealing, whatever cheating.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So you behave properly, and you were rewarded right away with respect,

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and people wanted to help you.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And then if there were, if there are future lives, you're going to be rewarded even more,

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
according to those who believe in that.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If not, well, so be it.

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And this whole thing like, I need to, people should do whatever makes them happy.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Probably about three quarters of people don't really know what makes them happy.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Which means for them, happiness is the experience when they're not experiencing unhappiness.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Which means for them, pursuit of happiness is actively running away from the prospect of unhappiness.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Which means your whole life revolves around running away from experiencing unpleasant feelings.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's your definition of happiness.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Being constant, being constantly chased by unhappiness and anxiety.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Exactly, exactly.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And that's what definition of happiness becomes for people.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And if you look at it, that's exactly how people live their lives.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's why there's so many issues in the modern society.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
People with mental problems developing them too much pressure, too much stress.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They can't deal with it, medications, everything else,

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
vices, giving in to extreme measures, because you don't know what to do anymore.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're proliferated in that escape so much and took it at its face.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, you both took it as if it's sort of a good thing.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How you just do whatever makes you happy.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What makes me happy?

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, I'm happy when I don't experience unhappiness.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So then what must move?

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I must prevent unhappiness and all cost.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And then you become very stressed.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And then sensuality becomes the only mean of gaining some degree of happiness.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But that's not happiness. That's just management of your unhappiness.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Which of course, from the point of view of that unhappiness, is happiness.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But it's a very relative happiness.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's not really a happiness that can last.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But a happiness that lasts is one way you don't have to maintain it.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Exactly.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, the happiness is the happiness in itself, which means it's happiness of freedom.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Happiness of being above things that can affect you.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not kind of happiness of necessity.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Like, I need to keep running away because it's this beast chasing me.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's not happiness.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You might feel a relief when you feel like, oh, you're temporarily safe from the beast.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And there is happiness from the, obviously, the threat, the imminent threat of the beast attacking you.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But overall, you're still not free from the beast, which means that's only a relative happiness.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And that beast is basically any form of suffering in this life.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Internal, external, any anxiety, fear, stress, burden, loss, any of that.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's basically an example of the beast you're running away from.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because the mind is just at its face value.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What it does when it experiences suffering, it turns away from it.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Wants to get rid of it.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Wants to prevent it.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And then that becomes a definition of the purpose of your life, just running.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And that's why people compulsively give in to the central desire.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not optional.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There is no matter, oh, I will refrain from sensuality today, unless the circumstances refrain you.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's why it's not, it's almost mandatory for people to, why?

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Because they chose the path of running away.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Which equals to say they chose the path of just taking their desires at the face value.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Which means they won't be able to resist them.

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And that's why you're bound.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're bound by the desire.

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're bound by fear.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're bound by running away from suffering.

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So any happiness that you can experience is going to be within that.

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Which means it's a measly happiness.
