1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,920
So I have a few suitors that I would like to go through and this theme is really about

2
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:55,360
sense of restraint and the Buddha gave a short teaching to Bahia, he gave a short teaching

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:08,560
to Malonkia Buddha, the same, the same verse. So I'll just read out Janabhira's translation

4
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,640
of this. Okay, then by here you should train, train thus, in the scene there shall be just

5
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,440
the scene, in the herd, there shall be just the herd, in a sense there shall be just

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,720
the sense, in the cognize there shall be just the cognize, thus by here should you train

7
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,720
yourself. When by here for you in the scene there shall be just the scene, the herd,

8
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:45,320
just the sense, just the cognize, then you will not be that by which, when you shall not

9
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:52,480
be that by which, then you shall not be in that place, when you shall not be in that place,

10
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,660
then you will be, you will neither be here nor yonder, nor between the two, just this

11
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:14,260
is the ending of suffering. So when he says you will not be that by which, you will not

12
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,880
be in that place, and you will not be here, or yonder, or between the two. So I think

13
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:30,400
here yonder and between the two, what is that, you know, here is the sense basis. Yes,

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,400
yeah, yeah. You will need to be your sense basis. Well, you neither, your self will neither

15
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,120
be taken to be your sense basis, or sense objects, or both, or neither, whichever you

16
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,840
think, something you can through denial of things, you can establish your sense of self.

17
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,840
So you can deny, like, there is here, there is yonder, and in between the two, would

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,720
stand basically for both here and yonder, and neither here nor yonder. The mental attitude

19
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,680
in regard to the experience of the whole of here and yonder, because the self can always

20
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,320
kind of, even through denial of it, can reestablish itself as not that, but implying I am something

21
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,040
else. Although there isn't anything else to be found simply through that denial, negation

22
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,480
of something, you give enough space for the notion of self to remain. So in that sense,

23
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:35,880
basically, when in seeing that is just the scene, no amount of movement, so to speak, of

24
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,040
the mind in regard to the high and the sights in the experience of the scene, no amount of

25
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,480
the movement, whether it's in it, a parchment, both in it or a parchment, whether it's

26
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,960
mind, whether it's for me, whether it's this, none of that will induce the sense of self.

27
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,160
When in seeing, there is just the scene, or in other words, when the scene is not appropriate,

28
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,120
and the senses that are seen are not appropriate. When both, the senses in that which is being

29
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,720
seen are not appropriate. Then, in the scene, there is just the scene. So when you're neither

30
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:20,240
appropriating it, and appropriation is basically established either through indulging it or

31
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:30,320
running away from it, indulging it or denying it, either way, you basically relate to it.

32
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,600
So to speak, and that relation is a form of appropriation. So that's why he doesn't,

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,280
he doesn't either indulge the sights, nor does he fear them or run away from them. The

34
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:50,240
scene is just a scene. There is no need to do anything in regard to it, for and haven't.

35
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
Because you have a pleasing sight or a displeasing sight.

36
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,280
Exactly. And so he. Pleasing sight is just a pleasing sight. For somebody who is not

37
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,960
developed in regard to pleasing sight, pleasing sight would be inducing last in their mind.

38
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,000
The last is not in the pleasing sight. That's what the Buddha said. That's one other

39
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,520
of Nianavira's translation, in the back of the book, saying that the target that perceives

40
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,520
beautiful objects in the world. He still sees, oh, this is beautiful, this is agreeable,

41
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:27,360
this is nice. But he, his thoughts do not have desire and lust in regard to those things.

42
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,040
But it's when people can't see that, can't see that the nature of desire and lust

43
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:38,960
pertains to the mind, it's not in the objects, then they deny the objects. They try to overcome

44
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,960
the desire and lust through sheer denial of objects. And that's the suit that the similar

45
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,240
of the, the bait in Majimonika, where, sure, one day, her eats Mara's bait, I enjoy the

46
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,440
sense of scale. And then, and then because of that, Mara does with them what he wants.

47
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,800
Then another group of their sees that, sees that the hunter controls this there, does

48
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,880
what he wants, because they're eating their traps and wearing it. Then they think, okay,

49
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,840
like in, in, in, in, completely similar range to the big ones, and the big ones would

50
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,880
see, okay, so indulgence of the sense of objects leads to, like, us being slaves to Mara.

51
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:29,800
So then, they deny the entire sense of fear. And in that suit that says the deer, then

52
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,680
shuns the bait completely, forgetting that they do depend on it to some extent. They

53
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,520
shun it, they go up in the mountains, but then sooner or later, the food, the water runs

54
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,000
out in the mountains, and they have to come back to that bait. And because they were never

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,360
developed in regard to the bait in the first place, they end up eating it, carelessly,

56
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,120
like the first deer here. And again, in the end, Mara does with them what he wants. It's

57
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:00,760
exactly like the indulgence and denial results in the same, results in you not being, not

58
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,760
understanding the nature of the bait and being controlled because of that. So the point

59
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:15,680
is that the deer would recognize that, if he would recognize the nature of the indulgence,

60
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,440
the nature of denial, and then it would stay within the domain of bait, because it depends

61
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,960
on a certain extent to it, it depends on the food, but it would not eat carelessly. And

62
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,320
that's the key. It could eat carefully, it would be careful of the bait. So he wouldn't

63
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,880
deny everything, he wouldn't throw away the baby with the bathwater, it would basically

64
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,280
start distinguishing. And that's a very, well, it's not necessarily subtle, it reminds

65
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,360
of getting used to it, but for most people, it's a very subtle distinction because people

66
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,880
either say yes or no completely. And then obviously, you have to start with restraint first,

67
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:07,160
restraint in regard to things that are not necessary, such as sexual integrals, things

68
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:15,840
based on excessive lust, things based on anger and so on, but then eating food is necessary.

69
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,960
But you can do it lustfully, you can do it because of craving, or you can do it mindfully.

70
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,160
But people who don't know, who can't distinguish that the lust is on them, not on the food,

71
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
then they start denying food, they try going food, and this is exactly what's happening,

72
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,200
a setisism, self-mortification, then that will sooner or later, that won't be enough.

73
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,960
Then they start denying more, then it can go as far as denying breeding, denying air, denying

74
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,120
anything. And the Buddha tried that and he said, no, this is not the way. Now that doesn't

75
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,040
mean that, okay, so now you should go back and eat everything unwarily again and be completely

76
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,600
unrestrained, that's as serious as it can be. But the Buddha was quite clear how one should

77
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,000
then practice. So you develop the virtue first, you develop the strain, you stop doing all

78
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,600
some things that are completely unnecessary and they have like inexcusable. But then other

79
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:18,680
things, you can't help by encountering agreeable sights, agreeable sounds. So if you're just

80
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,680
blaming sights and sounds, well the Buddha again said, you won't be different than a blind

81
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,840
or a deaf man. If you think that the domain of sight, the medicine is a problem, it's

82
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,400
not. His desire and lust in regard to it. So instead of being the second ear that runs

83
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,880
to the mountain in fear of the whole domain, no, you recognize that, so you stay within

84
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,880
it. Practice restraint to the extent necessary. But then for the rest, you start developing

85
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,640
mind from a sin regard to it. That means eating the food carefully, not being careless in

86
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,080
regard to the bait. Because that's what the bait is, carelessness. That's what gives

87
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,800
rise to lust, to aversion, to delusion. It's not the actual food, it's not the actual

88
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:08,800
sense objects. No matter how agreeable they are. What was the other quote you just said?

89
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,480
They don't want to do that out of our video. Well they didn't know, because it's exactly

90
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:22,200
what I'm saying. Just before that, what you're saying now, because to shun the bait seems

91
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,720
to me, it's a very, well it's a very, some sort of evil will be. Oh yeah, of course.

92
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,760
You're pushing away. Yeah. It's aversion. Your aversion. Yeah. You're averse towards

93
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,000
that. Out of fear. Because you fear that agreeable sight sounds, melt taste, that will induce

94
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
lust, because you absolutely don't know, nor equals to prevent it, because you don't

95
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,400
understand it. But do it. So the only way that you know how to get

96
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,840
pushed things away is to be able to, well, you push away pleasing things, and then you bring

97
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,920
the things that displease you closer. So then that becomes that which pleases you. So

98
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,560
end up just acting in the same way, like the first herd. Because that other herd, they

99
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,400
see what the hunter's about, they see what the bait's about, and they've overcome it.

100
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,720
He's kind of bewildered by the bait. They stay there, but they don't need the bait, so

101
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,320
he can't see them, because they're never caught on the hooks. But the food is eaten around

102
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,960
the bait. But is there really a bait with the hunter

103
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:35,960
really exists in illusion? Yes, it's much. That is the case. That's the situation you're

104
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,360
born in. The hunt, the ground for hunting you in there. Oh yeah, that's all the gosh

105
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,360
people can deny. It's all sorts of views and stuff, which is of course, that's why the

106
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
acknowledgement of those things has to come first. But when we are talking about, we assume

107
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,640
that we agree on that. So it's a different topic now. We agree that there is such thing

108
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:13,560
as being controlled by the senses and being a victim to it. So this is another sutra from

109
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:28,040
Saint Utanikaya, and chapter 35 verse 94. It's called untamed or unguarded. So the Buddha

110
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:35,000
is speaking, because these six bases for contact, if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained,

111
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:48,280
unbringers of suffering. Just six because of the basis for contact, where one unrestrained

112
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,520
meets with suffering, those who know how to restrain them, well uncorupted, with faith

113
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:01,240
their partner. Having seen forms at delight the mind and having seen those that give no

114
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,240
delight to spell the path of lust towards the delightful and do not soil the mind by thinking

115
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,940
the other is displeasing to me. So they have been seeing the delightful. It doesn't say

116
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:21,360
run away from delightful. Cover your eyes from delightful. It says, dispel the lust in

117
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,640
regard to delightful. Having seen a non-delightful, don't end up thinking about how non-delight

118
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:40,080
I don't end up developing a version in regard to non-delightful, mental version, but it

119
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,000
doesn't say run away from non-delightful, because that is the way out. That means you're

120
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,440
blaming non-delightful and you're blaming the lightful for your lust and for your

121
00:13:50,440 --> 00:14:05,000
lust. You're not seeing it where it is, but not seeing it where it is you cannot possibly

122
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,240
have rooted. Having heard sounds both pleasant and noisy, do not be enthralled by pleasant

123
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,400
sound to spell the cause of hate towards the noise, do not soil the mind by thinking

124
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:23,040
this one is displeasing to me. Having smelt a fragrant delightful scent and having smelt

125
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,920
a putrid stench, to spell a virgin towards the stench and do not yield to desire for

126
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,160
the lovely. Having enjoyed a sweet delicious taste and having sometimes tasted what is

127
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,400
bitter, do not greedily enjoy the sweet taste, do not feel a version towards the bitter.

128
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:53,280
So if you can't be clearer than that, yet many people blame the taste. Do not greedily

129
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,840
enjoy the sweet taste. Don't be greed in regard to, it doesn't mean don't ever eat

130
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:06,160
sweet, agreeable taste. No, if you're generally equanimous in regard to the taste, it doesn't

131
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,680
matter if it's agreeable or disagreeable. It means if you're generally equanimous you

132
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,960
won't be running away from agreeable cause you fear that it will induce the last. No,

133
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:25,560
equanimity is basically absence of last to understanding. So removing of greed in regard

134
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,680
to the agreeable, in regard to delicious, having enjoyed delicious sweet taste. So you

135
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,840
can even enjoy it in a way without being greedy about it. Why? Cause it's agreeable, that's

136
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,560
a form of enjoyment. And that's just the fact. The sense enjoys it. You don't necessarily

137
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,000
enjoy it. And that's obvious that many people don't enjoy it because they fear it. And

138
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,720
that's a mistake. So you let the sense enjoy it, why? Because you have to eat. But you

139
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,800
don't do it unwarily, you don't do it carelessly because that will then induce greed in your

140
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,440
mind. And then you will be appropriate in sense that enjoys it. But you can't enjoy

141
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:10,200
the taste even if you want to. You always pertains to the like that physical sense, presence

142
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:18,480
of the matter that is your tongue. So the fact that you think that you can enjoy it and

143
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,400
then you deny it through running away, through practicing extreme asceticism, through not

144
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,880
eating because you fear the taste basically. You are fully appropriating your sense base

145
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,080
and then protecting it because you can't let go of it. The hunt is chasing you. You've

146
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:41,480
been chased. You're running away. You can't sort of... Well, no, yeah. I mean, in the sense

147
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:49,320
you can't run away because you're holding onto the bait. Yeah, you're not eating it because

148
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,880
you're fearing it, but you're holding onto it. Which is amounts to the same thing. You're

149
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,160
hooked by the bait one way or the other. Are they treating it carelessly or through holding

150
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:07,160
it tightly out of fear? We're saying as well. And you can never see that actually you can't

151
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,040
even enjoy the taste even if you want to. The sense will enjoy the taste for as long as

152
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,800
you deny it. For as long as you deny agreeable taste. So you know for fact that you're restrained.

153
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,080
You know for fact that you eat once a day. You know for fact that you're not seeking out

154
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,480
for a pleasant taste. And then you encounter a pleasant taste. And feeling that is just

155
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,080
basically completely like a wisdom. Running away from it, it's even further like a wisdom.

156
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,600
Trying to prevent it, trying to not feel it with your tongue or whatever. It's just playing

157
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:48,520
ridiculous. Because those objects of the senses are for the senses in their domain. It's

158
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,160
their business kind of. Exactly. So whatever they get. The file animals, they have

159
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,320
feeding grounds. It's not. I mean, you will be affected by it when you appropriate that

160
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,680
feeding ground, when you appropriate that animal the feeding. When you are, when your mind

161
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,160
is inseparable from your tongue, when your tongue is appropriated, when your eyes are appropriated,

162
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,680
you will be well, you will be affected by what you see, what you taste and so on. And running

163
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,680
away from it, it's just another form of being affected by it.

164
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:26,800
Because no matter what comes into the eye, so to speak, where would you see the eyes?

165
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,440
Yes. So then in the scene, there is a scene and then you will not be dead by which. And

166
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,200
that's what it means. Being dead by which in another sutra, when another says, it's

167
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,880
the eye, eye, as the organ makes you dead by which you are the conceiver. You are the

168
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,920
one who sees the things, thus you end up conceiving them as mine. So because you just automatically

169
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,200
appropriated the sense-basis, because they don't appear as objects. They are always

170
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,880
negative in regard to it, which means they are even harder to see. They have to be seen

171
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,840
as a negative phenomenon. And because of them, most people don't see it. And because of

172
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,680
that, because of their appropriation of their sense-basis, in this case, let's say,

173
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:14,480
eyes, they are the seer of the eye objects, because they just descended down into the eye.

174
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:22,240
They took them. So now what I see means I see that. What tongue-tastes aren't tasting

175
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,640
that. And that's what they mean, they're being dead by which. But if seen, there is just

176
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,920
a scene in taste, there is just a taste. They will not be dead by which. But they're not

177
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,240
dead by which. They don't appropriate the sense organs. Well, they will not be in the

178
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,280
objects. Whether they are not properly in the sense organs, nor are they found in the

179
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,640
objects, they will not be here, nor yonder, nor between the two. No behind in front.

180
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,440
No behind in front, above, left or right. They will simply not be room for the sense

181
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:00,040
of self. Because sense of self can authorize without the basis, which is appropriation regarding

182
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,240
things as mine. But that's completely prevented, through understanding that it's impossible

183
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,120
to be there in the first place. You can't all those things in the first place. So you

184
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,600
prevent the appropriation means there is no room for sense of self. You don't even think,

185
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,720
oh, now I have to practice the non-self. Not that experience or non-appropriation is the

186
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
experience of non-self.

187
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:30,960
You take like there's the sum of those animals and the senses as the animals. So the dog

188
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:38,280
is eating its food. But if you, you can never have that food that the dog is eating because

189
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,720
you're not, you're not the dog. You're not the dog, yeah. So even if you thought you were

190
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:49,680
holding onto the dog and thinking that you are eating this food, whatever it is, that's,

191
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,360
you can't get any of that stuff. So you're going to be suffering constantly.

192
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Well, think of it like this basically. The only way for you to eat the food is for tongue,

193
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,560
mouth, digestive organ to engage with the food. And all of those things, if you look at

194
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:13,720
them independently, so to speak, are independent of you. Your mouth, your organ, it's not in your

195
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,320
control. Those things have a reason and they correspond, well, they have objects that

196
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,040
correspond to it, they engage with it. So not recognizing the impermanence of the sense

197
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,200
basis, for example, you're appropriately automatic.

198
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,440
Yeah, the similar of the animals doesn't quite work in this sense because you can always

199
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,080
well, nothing stops you from eating dog food. The thing is, the five animals, but basically

200
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,400
you know the domains because of them. You can't, you can't have, you cannot have relationship

201
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,400
with sight without the eyes, which means basically all you can have relationship with, it is,

202
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:01,640
all you can have relationship with is eyes seeing things. You can't access sights unless

203
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,880
I see them first. So you can't even have the idea, you can't even mentally think about

204
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:15,440
sights without applying eyes. But if you don't appropriate your eye, then your eye is going

205
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,920
to just look at it. It's going to be on your strength.

206
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Exactly, that's what people think, exactly. So they think, oh, so I must let go of my eyes,

207
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,600
which means, but no, you're still, you are responsible for your strength. So once you

208
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,120
start restraining and the precepts are quite clear, where the five, where the eight, where

209
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,800
the ten, no matter how many, they are quite clear. And that's what you decide beforehand.

210
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,800
And then you start seeing the negative phenomenon of the eye, eye object. Sorry, eye base, eye

211
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,440
bases, the sense bases of the eyes. And then you recognize, okay, so it's still within

212
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,840
that strength. So if you were now to make the jump from non-appropriation of the eye to

213
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,200
a non-restraint of the eye, that would have to be a conscious jump. That can't happen

214
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,960
by accident. Why? Because eyes stopped engaging in an awesome, fully, un-awesome thing through

215
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,000
setting up the seal at first. So now you can genuinely let go of the eyes. Why? Because

216
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,360
they won't go into that awesome. Because they used to go into an awesome, only because

217
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:26,960
you were sending them there. That's why the Buddha said you can't possibly engage in sensuality

218
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:36,120
without having fully established sensual perceptions. And for that, you're fully responsible. And

219
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,640
that cannot be done without appropriation of the eyes. So quite the opposite from what

220
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:49,440
people believe, genuinely letting go, genuinely not appropriating the eye base, fully prevents

221
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:59,240
even a possibility of sensual engagement. Because that is intentional, once the eyes have

222
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:06,400
been taken as mine, then you relish the pleasure that you fully feel you can access. And that's

223
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,560
the whole point of sensuality. That's the whole nature of it. You feel you are in touch

224
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,640
with your disagreeable objects, either through consuming them through your mouth, through

225
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,000
your eyes, through your nose, through grasping them with your hands. It's exactly what sensuality

226
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,040
is consumption. And you can only assume that you can consume things when you have appropriated

227
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:35,040
the bases. There are the only ones that can access them. But even then, all you are consuming

228
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:43,080
that you are consuming are the sense bases that then, on their own external kind of level,

229
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,240
correspond to these sensuality and interact with them. So you can never actually access the

230
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,560
sights. All you can have is, all you can see, so to speak, is eye-seeing things.

231
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,080
Exactly. So all you can have is your sense base being affected by these things, but you

232
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:05,120
can't access those things. So you can't actually taste the food. You can taste your tongue

233
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,520
tasting the food. You can't touch things. You can experience your body being touched

234
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,640
by things or your body touching things. In other words, it's always indirect. You can

235
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,000
never bypass the body as a sense of touch or bypass the tongue and go straight to the

236
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,440
sense objects. Which means, the sense objects are kind of always determined by your sense

237
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,200
base. Because if your eyes are not seeing certain colors, that's it. You can't even

238
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,400
consume those colors. You can't even consume. You're only like in some, like, maybe external

239
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,240
communication, I get the idea. You're seeing things differently, but for you, that is what

240
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,240
you see. That is the real thing. Which means you can only access sensors that are being

241
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,680
affected by external objects, by external magic. And that recognition already approves any

242
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:56,360
desire you can have for central engagements with those external objects, by, because

243
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,680
they're inaccessible. No matter how hard you press, how hard you squeeze, how hard you

244
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,280
taste, how hard you look, or you know, you're fully understood. You can't doubt it anymore.

245
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,040
That all you're seeing is your eye seeing. All you're tasting is your tongue tasting. All

246
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:18,120
you're touching is your body touching. So it's always an indirect. An indirect man. Like

247
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,360
you can't turn away, turn back and look at the things. The only way you can see them

248
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:29,840
is by having a mirror in front of him. That's your way of looking back. And in this

249
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,440
simulate, looking back is basically the sense objects. There are there in the world, inaccessible.

250
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,360
The only way to access them is when they're reflected upon the sense base. When they engage,

251
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,360
they're corresponding engagement with the sense base. Then you see it. How it corresponded

252
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,720
to it. But it still doesn't mean you're actually accessing the matter of the sense objects,

253
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,280
impossible. They will require you to come out of all of your sense bases and it goes straight

254
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,960
to the matter. But that is inconceivable. Because even that thought is based on a complete

255
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:15,960
experience of sense bases, even in the imaginary basic, even in the imagination. In a 7 out of

256
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:24,960
6 animals. 5. A 6 out of 5. Comment what they are, crocodile. Crocodile monkey, yeah.

257
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,960
It's 5 animals and then the mind base their meat in the mind. Like the 5 senses in the

258
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:39,760
mind. Because it's the monkey. He says the monkey mind. I don't know. They pull to their

259
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,000
own feeding grounds and the thing is he's got a rope tied. He ties the rope in the middle

260
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,960
and then they just pull. I know that was ever the strongest. That's where everyone

261
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,960
has got it. Because they're tied to the same meal. So everyone goes with the crocodile

262
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,960
or whatever. And then he doesn't just tie it in the middle. He tied it to a post and

263
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,960
that's discernment. That's mindfulness. And then they get tied. They stop pulling

264
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,960
it. So they can't actually go there because they tie it. See that similarly. You don't

265
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,960
tie it in the middle together because then the strongest will pull. That's basically

266
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:23,960
when people use a certain sense to overcome other senses. See unpleasant sights sound

267
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,960
abothering you. But then your mind just goes start thinking about a pleasant taste.

268
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,960
You're bothered by unpleasant touch, unpleasant taste. But then you like the beautiful

269
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,960
instance and then you're enjoying the pleasant smell and your mind comes down because of that.

270
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Or sometimes admiring the beautiful view as a form of meditation. Which is as

271
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,960
mistaken as it can be. Because that's exactly it. Ah, this sense seems calmer than

272
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,960
the others. So you use that sense to overcome the others. But in that sense,

273
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,960
when that sense changes, you will be pulled and all the other senses will go for it.

274
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Because this is the strongest among them. So I don't really recommend that way.

275
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,960
That's why you must not use any sense as a basis for a meditation because that's

276
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,960
not meditation. And the Buddha did say that actually. Like a jackal waiting for

277
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,960
a mouse or an owl waiting for a prey, praying upon a fish. Like waiting hunting,

278
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,960
hunting, waiting, grabbing the moment, waiting, waiting, waiting. So the misguided person

279
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,960
overmeditates, undermeditates, mismeditates, premeditates, but he doesn't

280
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,960
meditate. And basically, when they miss the point of meditation, they end up

281
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,960
meditating with the mind revolving on centrality. And revolving on centrality means

282
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,960
revolving around dependence on a sense, for pleasure, for pain, for peace.

283
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Yes, there was nothing pleasing in a sight, nothing pleasing in a smell,

284
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,960
no taste, no sight. It's a pleasing sight. But there is no greed for the pleasure

285
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,960
of that sight. It's just a pleasing sight. But if there's no pleasing,

286
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,960
but there's a, the only way you can get pleasure is to say your body.

287
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Right, right, right. Then you would go comfort. You would go to the physical comfort.

288
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,960
There's no physical comfort that you go fences about the sight, or even just

289
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,960
going to your imagination. It's kind of a reproduction of the other senses in

290
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,960
their peaceful state, in the state of not being gained by their hunger or

291
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,960
whatever else. But it's again, revolves around them.

292
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,960
So, everyone's got to, well, suppose everyone's going climb to certain

293
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,960
senses. Yeah, exactly. From the front of each other, or some people have issues

294
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,960
with food restraints and so on. Or music, you have to listen to it.

295
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,960
Oh, yeah, that's another thing that people listen to music as a form of meditation.

296
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,960
That's exactly what I was describing here. It's, it's after, after the

297
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:59,960
limous guide. When touched by a pleasant contact,

298
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,960
and do not be enthralled, do not tremble when touched by paint.

299
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Look evenly on both the pleasant and the painful, not drawn or repiled by

300
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:17,960
anything. To me, that touch is quite a, it's very inside, you know,

301
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,960
it's so close. It's quite a, to be able to look evenly on both

302
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,960
pleasant and painful touch.

303
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Not have your mind swayed by it, by the prospect of comfort,

304
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,960
by the possibility of discomfort, fanophysical kind.

305
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Being swayed means not, not, not, not craving it.

306
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,960
And not running away from it. Why? Because it wasn't

307
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
able to begin with. Why are you running away from it?

308
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Why are you trying to avoid it? You trying to avoid it means basically

309
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,960
you're still regarding it as you are. The sense basis,

310
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,960
you're trying to avoid things that correspond to your sense base.

311
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,960
So you're trying to avoid comfort or discomfort depending on your view.

312
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,960
But you will only be committed to avoiding it because you fool

313
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,960
the appropriate in this body. Instead of letting go of the body,

314
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,960
relinquishing any notion of appropriation,

315
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
then sometimes comfort, sometimes discomfort.

316
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,960
The mind doesn't, it doesn't get swayed, doesn't get affected.

317
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Because as you can feel your whole body, your whole body is touched.

318
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,960
So it's not appropriate, you know.

319
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,960
See, that's the thing, you can't run away from that.

320
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Yeah, you can't.

321
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,960
That's why mindfulness in the body plays such a fundamental.

322
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Because of that, and because all the other senses are basically bodily,

323
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,960
so eluded, contained in this very body.

324
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,960
So if you stop appropriating the body as a sense base in its entirety,

325
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,960
there's a sixth sense base, then you won't be appropriating

326
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,960
sight, sense, notay, stutters, or thoughts and energies.

327
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,960
You won't be appropriating anything physically or mentally.

328
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,960
And if you're not appropriated, you don't run away from it.

329
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,960
Because disagreeable was not yours to begin with.

330
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
And even if there is any response to agreeable,

331
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
it's a bodily response.

332
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,960
It's a response of the sense base that you don't appropriate,

333
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
which means it's only a limited response.

334
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
It can never be a response with lust,

335
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
a response with aversion, a response with delusion,

336
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,960
because they're all intentional responses, responses for which

337
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:02,960
you and your misappropriation of things was responsible for.

338
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,960
You continue further the same, Sutta.

339
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,960
When common people have proliferated perception,

340
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,960
to see even proliferate, they become engaged.

341
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Having dispelled every mind state bound to the home life,

342
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,960
one travels on the road of renunciation.

343
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,960
When the mind is lust, well developed in six, these six phases.

344
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,960
If touched, one's mind never flutters anyway,

345
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,960
having vanquished both lust and hate,

346
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,960
because go to the far shore beyond birth and death.

347
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:47,960
So this is another suit of mine after its 95th millennium.

348
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,960
A great monk was a great name.

349
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,960
And he goes to quite old apparently, at the stage in the...

350
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I think I remember him from my journey, he was a Sutta fan.

351
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
Yeah, he was a Lenin.

352
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
No, he was a Lenin.

353
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,960
There was a Sutta fan, he was asking whether I'll come so that my mind can sometimes also be affected

354
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,960
by I'm also a steady forget about that mind, so on.

355
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Oh yeah, there, also.

356
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,960
But maybe there was a different one than him, you know.

357
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
I don't know if it was a dip, yeah, but the same name.

358
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
The same name, yeah.

359
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
So he asked the Buddha for a short.

360
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,960
You might say that you might, a short discourse or a short message.

361
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,960
So you might dwell alone withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.

362
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,960
So the Buddha goes on to say, questions.

363
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
What do you think Melunkiya Buddha?

364
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Do you have any desire, lust or affection for those forms cognizable by the eye that you have not seen or never saw before?

365
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,960
That you do not see and would not think might be seen.

366
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Yes.

367
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Do you have any desire, lust or affection for those touches cognizable by the body that you haven't, have not touched you and never been touched by before?

368
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,960
And you do not touch now and would not touch you.

369
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Is this no veneration?

370
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:39,960
It's impossible to have lust for things that have never, for sites that have never been seen.

371
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
They will never be seen.

372
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
You can't possibly imagine them.

373
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Because why? Because they have never been seen.

374
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,960
So you can't have lust for that, for that which has an arisen.

375
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:01,960
You can't have lust for that which has not left an imprint on a sense space.

376
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:15,960
So to speak, figuratively speaking doesn't actually have an imprint, but you can't have lust for that.

377
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
It's inconceivable.

378
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,960
And it's similar what I was saying before.

379
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
So you recognize that.

380
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Then if you see that basically it's impossible to lust or have aversion towards site that has never been seen, never will be seen.

381
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,960
You can't even imagine seeing.

382
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Then you recognize that sites that you did see, that you will see are completely circumstantial.

383
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,960
They are far more inferior to all of the things that you haven't seen.

384
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
What? Because they were seen.

385
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Which means it's always like things that are seen always arise on a basis of great things that haven't been seen.

386
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,960
So then you realize that even your lust is completely gratuitous and unnecessary and pathetic.

387
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Because you're lasting this sight that was completely random and circumstantial and easily could have not been.

388
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
There's a big change.

389
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,960
So if you recognize that in whatever you're experiencing that this could have not been, it is but could have not been.

390
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,960
And the fact that it could have not been precedes the fact that it is.

391
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,960
It means it's completely circumstantial thus it was never for me. It could have never been for me.

392
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,960
And it certainly never be for me.

393
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Because that being for me, the mind, it's already like makes it special, it gives it priority.

394
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
It makes it more important.

395
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,960
But if something is circumstantial, it could have not been between it and it won't be.

396
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Something else will come its place. And then when that does, that could have also not been.

397
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,960
And you can't have lust for things that have never been.

398
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Thus, when you do have lust for things that are, that's just on top of that completely gratuitous on top of that circumstantial arising.

399
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:24,960
So just through recognizing that you can't have lust for things that have never reason, you can actually bang on lust for things that have.

400
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,960
By seeing the circumstantial nature, which is nothing other than saying by seeing a reason things as a permanent.

401
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:39,960
And if permanent means impossible to home, means basically subject to cessation, subject to cessation.

402
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Doesn't mean you actually witnessing the cessation.

403
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,960
You just recognize it. This is circumstantial, which means you have no idea where it came from.

404
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,960
And because of that, it will cease.

405
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,960
Even if you keep witnessing it for the rest of your life, it still remains permanent.

406
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
That covers everything that might be seen.

407
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,960
It covers all the possibilities as well, exactly.

408
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Because whatever might be seen, it's going to be seen on a circumstantial basis.

409
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,960
And as a danger, if you don't cover it, if you don't know that, the danger is...

410
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,960
You'll have things unincluded basically in this direction, yeah?

411
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:25,960
It's like a couple, I say, a man and a woman get together, they love each other.

412
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Infatuated with each other.

413
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,960
But he's seen her, but he might see someone else tomorrow.

414
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
There might be even more desire.

415
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,960
And he can't stop that from happening.

416
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
He can shout off his eyes, but then...

417
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Yeah, because you never practice restraint. You got the things he sees, things he touches, things he desires.

418
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
And then he loses interest in his wife.

419
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Exactly. He just moves on to another.

420
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,960
But if he were to see that even the first one was completely circumstantial,

421
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,960
he would have... well, he would have been able to control his desire, if not completely abandoning.

422
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
There's a reason for abandoning.

423
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,960
But what I'm saying is that even a lay person, not necessarily a man who is practicing for our hardship,

424
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:20,960
a lay person who is in union with the opposite sex, can use this reflection to remain faithful,

425
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,960
to remain restrained, to remain but to the other wisdom.

426
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,960
There's that sort of a couple, the man and woman, came to the Buddha.

427
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,960
And they asked him how to...

428
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,960
I think they might both have the right view.

429
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
And the Buddha...

430
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
How do you...

431
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,960
Well, I'm not sure if it was that sort of how to really go together, but he was basically sort of a...

432
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,960
He says, oh, yeah, they practice like perfect, they're perfectly faithful to each other.

433
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
He's like, not just, they've never...

434
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,960
Like, the husband says, not just that he never cheated on the wife,

435
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,960
but he also never, never like verbally was unfaithful to her.

436
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,960
And it was never even unfaithful to her, even in his mind.

437
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
And she says the same.

438
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,960
It doesn't mean that he never saw a pretty woman,

439
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,960
nor that she never seen a more handsome man.

440
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,960
It seems to mean that they recognized, like, the intentional aspect of the desire of the choice,

441
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,960
and they clearly respected each other, then they just...

442
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Okay, there was a more pleasing sight, but more pleasing sight does not mean last is there.

443
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Last is there when you're careless in regard to the more pleasing sight,

444
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
and they were never careless.

445
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
Thus, they were never unfaithful to each other.

446
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,960
And they would have praised it, that's exactly how somebody who wants to be a union should live.

447
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,960
And you can see that's already quite a...

448
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,960
quite a good degree of wisdom that most people today, an average person,

449
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
just be too conceivable for them.

450
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,960
Why?

451
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Because what you see, you just go for it.

452
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,960
And then even though a lot of union marriage just remains utterly random,

453
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,960
and circumstantial based on just things.

454
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,960
And then, yeah, people divorced, people end up hating each other,

455
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
because why?

456
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Just follow the senses, then and now either aging will go bold with it,

457
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,960
or find something better, but then the whole kind of notion of marriage and commitment

458
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,960
is sort of now basically hindering it.

459
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,960
So they feel enslaved by their own choices, basically.

460
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
And they only have themselves to blame.

461
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
Oh, nothing.

462
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Yep.

463
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,960
So in this suit, again, he goes into that...

464
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,960
You can see in the shot, you can just see, he gives you that short teaching.

465
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,960
And then Melanchio put, he says,

466
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:49,960
I understand in detail, when it was so the meaning of what was stated by the blessed one.

467
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,960
And then he gives, he says, this verse.

468
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,960
And the Buddha agrees with him, good, good, Melanchio put it,

469
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,960
it is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief.

470
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,960
And I'll just read down to you.

471
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,960
When seeing a sight, mindfulness becomes confused.

472
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,960
If attention is focused on the pleasant aspect,

473
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,960
experiencing it with the mind for the desire,

474
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,960
one remains assuming to cling to it.

475
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Many feelings grow arising from sight.

476
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,960
So again, back to the beginning of the verse,

477
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,960
so it says quite clearly,

478
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,960
that wrongly attending to the pleasant sight,

479
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,960
desire and last and assumption grows in regard to it,

480
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,960
not just by merely having a pleasant sight,

481
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,960
which means pleasant sight or a pleasant sight was never the problem.

482
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
It's not the problem.

483
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,960
It's you don't know, not knowing how to attend to it,

484
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,960
you end up being confused.

485
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Being confused, you end up assuming,

486
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,960
the whole desire, the whole, the whole basically thing

487
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
ends up proliferating and growing more and more.

488
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
And then, yeah, just the feelings grow.

489
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Well, exactly, yeah.

490
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,960
Upon giving into pleasure,

491
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,960
you might sometimes experience more pain.

492
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Then by trying to run away from that pain,

493
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,960
you discovered some new pleasure.

494
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,960
And there was all based on the initial confusion

495
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,960
in regard to pleasant sight,

496
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,960
which you, like, ignorantly,

497
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
crave for and went for.

498
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,960
Desired for, delighted in, lasted after.

499
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,960
Because of that, you just created basis for now,

500
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
all sorts of pleasant and pleasant neutral.

501
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,960
And giving into that, you create more basis for pleasantness,

502
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,960
for pleasantness. So again, feelings grow.

503
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,960
They're just cutting it off right there, and it doesn't.

504
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Not even.

505
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Well, you can take anything,

506
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
no matter how proliferated it is,

507
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,960
you can actually uprooted in its entirety

508
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,960
if you see the nature of craving towards pleasure.

509
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,960
Of nature, nature of avoiding.

510
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,960
Having aversion towards this pleasure.

511
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,960
The nature of indolence towards

512
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,960
neither pleasure nor this pleasure.

513
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,960
By understanding the nature of it,

514
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,960
then that just pertains,

515
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,960
permits the whole, no matter how proliferated the picture is.

516
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,960
Then basically, you kill the roots.

517
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
You kill the proliferating life.

518
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
There was being fed by ignorance.

519
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,960
You try it up, and then it's like a palm stump.

520
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,960
So the proliferated tree branches remain petrified.

521
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,960
They don't spread anymore.

522
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,960
Ignorance doesn't feel it.

523
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,960
So now it's just dried up habits of certain kind.

524
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,960
The ones they were completely dependent upon

525
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,960
sensuality fall off.

526
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,960
But some of it remains

527
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,960
until the aggregates break apart completely.

528
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,960
For another end.

529
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Maybe you want some of the pure, obviously,

530
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,960
one feelings to grow is like in the pleasure

531
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
to get more, more.

532
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,960
Oh, yeah. Well, that's right.

533
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,960
That's why sometimes people like

534
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
to expose themselves to the risk of this pleasure,

535
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,960
because it makes them pleasurably regret it.

536
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,960
So within a pleasant, non-threatening situation,

537
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,960
you kind of want to spice it up so to speak.

538
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,960
And then you make yourself kind of liable to some pain as well.

539
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,960
But it's all within the pleasurable image

540
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,960
that you've already fully engaged with.

541
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,960
Like, you know, overcoming challenges and stuff.

542
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,960
You can only engage that on the basis of pleasure.

543
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,960
If the whole thing suddenly turns

544
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,960
and then the whole thing becomes light-threatening.

545
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Oh, now it's serious.

546
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,960
And then you stop engaging in the same way.

547
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,960
But yeah, that's what people, you know,

548
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,960
go after frame, for example.

549
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,960
Even go after risk that, you know,

550
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,960
maybe they'll experience this pleasure.

551
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
But it's all within the image of pleasure

552
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,960
that they've initially given to you.

553
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,960
And then proliferated.

554
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,960
And then same, initially given into a version

555
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
that you go to this pleasure,

556
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,960
even if you study experiencing pleasure on top of it,

557
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,960
you won't be appreciating it,

558
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,960
because, you know, the mind is upset or whatever else.

559
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,960
So feeling good on top of each other.

560
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,960
But if you stop,

561
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
establish mindfulness,

562
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,960
all you can say, a feeling is there.

563
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,960
It doesn't matter.

564
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,960
It doesn't matter if it's the top of the proliferated tree

565
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,960
or the bottom. It doesn't matter.

566
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,960
A feeling has a reason,

567
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
which means every feeling,

568
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,960
no matter how many of them have grown,

569
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
how many of them have spread proliferated,

570
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
goal established,

571
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,960
every feeling carries an nature feeling,

572
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,960
which means in regard to every feeling,

573
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,960
you can practice abandoning of craving.

574
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,960
But they all carry the principle,

575
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
the universe of principle,

576
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,960
which principles lead some further.

577
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,960
So for me, you don't have to chase all of these proliferated feelings

578
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,960
as that's impossible.

579
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Now, they're trying to train all these branches

580
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,960
that are constantly growing.

581
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,960
You can't possibly keep up.

582
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,960
Instead, just kill the roots,

583
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,960
approach it,

584
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,960
remove the food from the ground

585
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,960
and the roots are sucking onto it.

586
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,960
That's it.

587
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
They die.

588
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,960
You don't have to worry about the branches spreading anymore.

589
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,960
You know for sure, they won't.

590
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,960
Even if you don't know where exactly they have proliferated,

591
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
you got so big,

592
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,960
no, you know that you've killed the roots,

593
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
one way or the other,

594
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:33,960
and the trees are being fed proliferation stuff.

595
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Yeah, one task.

596
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,960
Yes.

597
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,960
As opposed to trying to manage,

598
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,960
contain direct,

599
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,960
no, fashion,

600
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,960
the branches.

601
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Yeah, managing.

602
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,960
It's just for management.

603
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,960
You know, many feelings grow,

604
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
arising from sight.

605
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,960
The mind is damaged by coldness and cruelty,

606
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,960
heaping up suffering like this.

607
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,960
You said to be far from the barner.

608
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,960
When hearing a sound,

609
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,960
mindfulness becomes confused,

610
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,960
if attention is focused on the pleasant aspect,

611
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,960
experiencing with the mind full of desire

612
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,960
when it mains a sumitur.

613
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,960
Many feelings grow,

614
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,960
arising from sounds.

615
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,960
The mind is damaged by covetousness and cruelty.

616
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,960
Keeping up suffering like this,

617
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,960
you said to be far from the barner.

618
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,960
When it's smelling a smell,

619
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,960
when it's saving a taste,

620
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,960
when touching a touch,

621
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,960
when knowing a mental phenomenon,

622
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,960
it continues,

623
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,960
the mind is damaged

624
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,960
and it's far from the barner.

625
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Then it goes on to say,

626
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
seeing a sight with mindfulness,

627
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,960
there is no desire for sight.

628
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,960
The experiencing with the mind full of desire,

629
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,960
one doesn't remain assuming to it.

630
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,960
As it is for someone who lives mindfully,

631
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
when repeatedly seeing a sight,

632
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
feeling is ended,

633
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
not added to.

634
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Reducing suffering like this,

635
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,960
you said to be in the presence of the barner.

636
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,960
To this even, by making mindfully in regard to pleasant sight,

637
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
mindfully in regard to unpleasant sight,

638
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,960
so he neither develops lust nor aversion.

639
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,960
Mindfully in regard to neutral,

640
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,960
neither agreeable nor disagreeable sight.

641
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,960
He doesn't develop indolence,

642
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,960
he doesn't develop ignorance,

643
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,960
he doesn't develop delusion.

644
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Which means all of those feelings

645
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,960
arise simultaneously with that.

646
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,960
He understands as they arise,

647
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
so he doesn't add to them.

648
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,960
Basically adding to them means

649
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,960
he doesn't induce craving in regard to them.

650
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,960
That's what means ending of the feeling

651
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,960
as it has arisen.

652
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,960
Because when you crave for feeling obviously,

653
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,960
you go further and then you experience

654
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,960
another feeling when it can't do that,

655
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,960
and then another feeling when it can't do that.

656
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,960
There's no piling up,

657
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,960
so to speak, but increasing.

658
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,960
But if you're mindfully in regard to sight,

659
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,960
the feeling that has arisen,

660
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,960
that's it. You see it as impermanent.

661
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,960
By seeing it as impermanent,

662
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,960
why? Because you're mindfully in regard to sight,

663
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,960
there won't be any craving

664
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,960
in regard to that feeling,

665
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,960
because craving requires notion of permanence.

666
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,960
Be it craving for pleasure

667
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,960
or craving for avoiding of pain,

668
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,960
either way.

669
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,960
So by removing the craving,

670
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,960
you stop assuming it.

671
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,960
There's no pedana.

672
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,960
And touching a touch with mindfulness.

673
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,960
There's no desire for touches.

674
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,960
You're experiencing with the mind,

675
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,960
fear of desire one doesn't remain assuming to it.

676
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,960
As it is for someone who lives mindfully,

677
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,960
when repeatedly touching a touch,

678
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,960
feeling is ended,

679
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
not added to.

680
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,960
Reducing suffering like this,

681
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,960
is said to be in the presence of nirvana.

682
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,960
That's what I read there one night,

683
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,960
because there's a difference between touch and feeling.

684
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,960
Yeah, absolutely.

685
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,960
You recognize it.

686
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,960
Oh, I feel something in my back.

687
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,960
No, you're touching something in your back.

688
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,960
What is sensation in my knees?

689
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Yeah, that sensation is perception of the touch.

690
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,960
It's not a feeling.

691
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,960
People think sensations are feelings,

692
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
sensations are perceptions.

693
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:34,960
But is that repeatedly practicing mindfulness

694
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,960
in regards to it?

695
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,960
It approaches.

696
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,960
Yeah, feelings.

697
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,960
Reducing suffering like this.

698
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,960
Reducing it.

699
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,960
Because suffering can arise only in the basis of craving.

700
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,960
Encoding can arise only in the basis of ignorance in regard to feelings.

701
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,960
And in the ignorance in regard to feelings,

702
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,960
can arise only in the basis of non-mindfully attending to pleasure,

703
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,960
non-mindfully attending to pain.

704
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Then you're touched by the feeling.

705
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,960
When you're touched by the feeling,

706
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,960
you crave in regard to it.

707
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,960
So by mindfully attending to what's seen,

708
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,960
what's heard, what's taste,

709
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,960
what's touched, what's thought.

710
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,960
But mindful attending to it repetitively

711
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,960
the desire and lust in regard to diminishes,

712
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,960
aversion diminishes,

713
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,960
which means that feelings are not entertained,

714
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,960
not engaged, not crave for.

715
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,960
But each site and so on is either agreeable, disagreeable.

716
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,960
Or neither agreeable nor disagreeable.

717
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,960
So it's always felt.

718
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,960
Oh yeah, perception and feeling are conjoined.

719
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,960
You can't just have perception and feeling coming later.

720
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,960
It's over simultaneous.

721
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,960
That's why the mind is determined by perception and feeling.

722
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,960
So it's experiencing an agreeable sight?

723
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,960
Well, you can say there is an agreeable feeling corresponding to it.

724
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,960
But that still doesn't mean that you're touched by pleasure.

725
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,960
When you're ignorant in regard to agreeable feeling,

726
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:17,960
you basically, you're touched by pleasure, which means you crave for it.

727
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,960
And the craving is the inclination towards,

728
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,960
the inclination towards?

729
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,960
Yeah.

730
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,960
I'm going to suffer, like just leaning of the mind towards,

731
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:40,960
leaning the weight, craving for, craving against.
