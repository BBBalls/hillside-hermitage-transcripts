00:00.000 --> 00:24.240
So I was wondering about unhulsing and hulsing because you say that our faults are caused

00:24.240 --> 00:34.480
by acting unhulsing. So to overcome one's faults and let unhulsing behaviour which

00:34.480 --> 00:47.080
becomes self-transparent or authentic in regards to one's intentions, this is not so easy

00:47.080 --> 00:57.160
to do. The transparency, to be constantly watchful of your intentions while you go about

00:57.160 --> 01:06.520
your daily life is quite difficult. Sure, but is this the correct way?

01:06.520 --> 01:19.160
Well, the first point I would address would be, you mentioned it, the things of faults

01:19.160 --> 01:28.360
or things can be regarded as a fault if it's rooted in greed, aversion or delusion. So that

01:28.360 --> 01:33.600
basically a definition of a fault. So even if something is universally accepted, socially

01:33.600 --> 01:38.880
accepted to be done and normal, if it's rooted in greed, aversion, delusion, from the

01:38.880 --> 01:46.400
point of view of development in your mind, that is unhulsing. So that's where this self-transparency

01:46.400 --> 01:52.680
in regard to the motives behind you wanting to do things. That's why that self-transparency

01:52.680 --> 02:02.680
is necessary. It's necessary as a basis and then actually it is necessary or rather you

02:02.680 --> 02:09.200
don't have to look for anything other than that basis to develop your mind. In other words,

02:09.200 --> 02:14.520
the criteria that you will be using to develop the self-transparency is the criteria you

02:14.520 --> 02:21.000
can use all the way to complete development of your mind, that transparency. So it is definitely

02:21.000 --> 02:29.720
something to be done starting from your bodily actions that you start developing

02:29.720 --> 02:35.160
whatfulness and mindfulness in regard to things you want to do in your body and see where

02:35.160 --> 02:40.800
is that action rooted or where would it be rooted. Why do I want to do this? So initially

02:40.800 --> 02:47.480
you might have to kind of do it excessively in terms of interrogating yourself, but once

02:47.480 --> 02:54.440
that attitude becomes established, you don't have to think about the questions. Why am I doing

02:54.440 --> 03:02.280
this? Just looking at it would be already a form of investigating the motivation, which

03:02.280 --> 03:09.160
means just by looking at it you would be seeing where it is rooted at. So if you want to

03:09.160 --> 03:14.600
do something with your body in terms of I want to go somewhere or I want to eat something

03:14.600 --> 03:21.200
or I want to be working or whatever, you have to ask yourself why. Why do I want to do

03:21.200 --> 03:25.600
this? Then you might say, well, because other people need my help. I was like, okay, so

03:25.600 --> 03:30.800
then go further. So why are you the one in the position of giving your help to others?

03:30.800 --> 03:36.840
And so on. Doesn't mean like you have to classify this, oh, this is good or this is bad.

03:36.840 --> 03:41.960
All you want to do is just be fully transparent when it comes down to knowing why you are doing

03:41.960 --> 03:49.520
whatever you're doing. Because that's how you will start to sieve out many, many unwholesome

03:49.520 --> 03:54.280
things. The people end up doing habitually because they never look at the reasons why

03:54.280 --> 03:59.360
they're doing them. So they just go with it. And then that ends up proliferating and

03:59.360 --> 04:04.040
getting worse and worse. And then people acquire all sorts of habits and unwholesome things,

04:04.040 --> 04:09.880
sensuality and ill will just because they never really looked at it, never saw themselves

04:09.880 --> 04:24.160
doing it. You can put it that way. So going to watch a movie. Okay, yeah, that's a kind

04:24.160 --> 04:29.800
of, it's a neutral example. There's nothing in, nothing moral about watching a movie. There

04:29.800 --> 04:35.720
is nothing even ethically wrong to go and watch a movie. But if you had somebody who wants

04:35.720 --> 04:42.200
to develop their mind in terms of complete freedom from suffering or things of the

04:42.200 --> 04:47.440
pretend to the down of practice, then yeah, like you can say, oh, everybody watches the

04:47.440 --> 04:51.560
movie. It's fine. And then pretend that that's it. That's all to it. And then go and watch

04:51.560 --> 04:56.280
a movie. Oh, you can ask, well, everybody's not me and everybody's not practicing for

04:56.280 --> 05:03.080
me. So why am I going to do it? Why? Why do I want to do it? And if you discovered that

05:03.080 --> 05:08.440
motive behind you is just a distraction, because it feels a bit too heavy being alone

05:08.440 --> 05:12.520
or something, and then you want to go out and watch a movie. And it is, well, as I said,

05:12.520 --> 05:18.880
it's nothing immoral. But from the ultimate point of view of freedom of the mind, freedom

05:18.880 --> 05:23.680
of the mind from the senses, that is, that is an obstacle because you are giving into

05:23.680 --> 05:29.920
the distraction. You want to distract yourself. You want to, you want to engage in an attitude

05:29.920 --> 05:36.360
of delusion, of non-transparency, because it's, it's a bit too boring to just be all the

05:36.360 --> 05:42.640
car mindful or something like that. And then you give into it. But if your focus, so like,

05:42.640 --> 05:47.160
you know, somebody might hear this and say, okay, so I'll never watch a movie again. No,

05:47.160 --> 05:53.760
that's not a point. The point is you should never forget about the reasons why you do things.

05:53.760 --> 06:00.520
And that principle, that attitude, will straighten things out in itself. Because if you're never

06:00.520 --> 06:05.480
transparent, sorry, if you're always transparent, means you can't delude yourself anymore,

06:05.480 --> 06:10.560
which means sooner or later you start feeling guilty for constantly distracting yourself.

06:10.560 --> 06:14.600
And if you don't compromise the attitude of transparency, then that guilt will be enough

06:14.600 --> 06:19.880
to keep you away from things effortlessly. So yes, initially you might need to restrain

06:19.880 --> 06:24.760
yourself and say no to things, but that in itself won't lead to any understanding of the nature

06:24.760 --> 06:52.760
of things. You develop in self-transparency in regard to it, that might.
