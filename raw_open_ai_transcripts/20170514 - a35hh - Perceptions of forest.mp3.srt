1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
I was listening briefly this morning, the talk, learning how to feel, that one that you

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,600
did some time ago, I don't know, kind of more recent.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,440
Anyway, in the beginning of it, you were talking about these ideas as like, for example,

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,520
you go into the village and you establish your mind, perceptions of the forest, you know,

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,760
affected by anything in the village, but I found it difficult to understand that when

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,360
I tried to think of what does that mean, or it did this time as well, imagining myself

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
in a forest.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,800
Yeah, because you were not actually in the forest, that's, you couldn't have established

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,840
your, well, if you were in the forest and you might go to establish your own perception

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,080
of the forests, then you could quite likely be able to establish yourself still upon those

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,120
perceptions, even when you cease to be in the forest, but if you haven't been in the forest

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,560
and if you haven't established your mind upon the perceptions of the forest, then obviously

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
can't do that.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,920
It would remain on the level of abstraction.

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,000
And the reason why perceptions of the forest, well, in that subter, it's because what

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,240
is the main difference between a remote wilderness forest and village?

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,400
What would be the main difference?

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:26,320
No, people, absence of people, absence of others, just like the main characteristic of

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,800
the, if you establish your mind upon the perceptions of the forest, means no others.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,000
And then you stay established upon that perception when you go among others.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,280
And if you remain established, obviously, then nothing that comes from others can invade

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,800
you.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,360
I suppose I'm not understanding how one can remain established on the perception of

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,440
no people when there are people.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:03,640
Yeah, well, the mind can, because people already implies absence of them as a possibility.

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,840
When you actually went into the actual experience of that possibility of absence of people, you

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,280
kind of had it validated, you've been dwelling in, you've been living in, you go used to it,

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,360
you started discerning signs and tokens of such perceptions.

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Then you go among people, and you remain established upon the complete counterfeit absence

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
of people.

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,800
So you don't have to go to the forest to become another one, but it is certainly quite

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,080
a suitable way to develop a mind, which is why the Buddha was so encouraging about it.

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,280
And there was the purpose as well, forest means no others.

34
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
You don't run away from them because they bother you, you feed them or ever know.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,080
You go there to develop such perceptions, so that then when you surround them by people,

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,080
you want to make a difference.

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,560
Some of the people use this for the forest because they don't want to deal with anything,

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,520
so they feel like only I run away, but it is nothing to deal with, with others, more

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,680
than others, although it would be great, but that's probably the wrong basis for doing

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
such thing.

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:22,600
So the perceptions we're referring to is like how it is that I know that I am in a forest,

42
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,360
as opposed to how I know I am in a city, which is namely the absence of various things

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,120
in the forest.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,160
But then, so maybe the confused and I was like, what does it mean to establish the mind

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
on that reception?

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,360
I think that I was talking that in a talk where the mind is not established, then it's

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
an abstraction.

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,760
If the mind actually matches the level of that phenomenon, then it's easy to be abstraction,

49
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,200
and that's where the mind is established upon it, upon such notions.

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,200
So I'll have to definitely revisit that talk.

51
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,280
It's just not really clicking through how you're going to have establishments of perceptions

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,240
of something that is not directly present, being perceived, but that's the thing, as

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,280
I said, perceptions that tend to the senses, but also to the mind, thoughts of being perceived,

54
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,440
the sixth sense, mono, and it's counterpart, thumb, images.

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
So that's the main point.

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,800
So some perceptions that you have, like your eyes, ears, nose, you start discerning more

57
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,320
general perceptions, possibilities of such perceptions, and so on, which are all obviously

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,960
on the level of the mind.

59
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,680
That's why it's the establishment of the mind, not the establishment of the eye or

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
the ear.

61
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,280
And that's the main thing.

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,640
So absence of people, it's almost present on the level of mind when you're looking at

63
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,960
people, when you're surrounded by people, when you're eyes see people, as a remote possibility

64
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,720
to that which is on the mental level, it's the absence of these very people.

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,840
And that's where the mind gets established.

66
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,560
So that's how you can look at people while the mind is established on the counterpart

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,960
of the absence of people.

68
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,880
You're not denying that they're not real, they're very real, but the mind does not descend

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,920
on the level of the eye.

70
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,360
It stays established upon the images, perceptions, then it has developed while in the forest.

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,040
And then it recognizes as in that sutra, now while I'm established, while upon these

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,880
perceptions of the forest, I can't be bothered by anything in the village.

73
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,520
But I can be bothered by changes in the forest.

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,760
So then he expands that, and then he establishes his mind upon the phenomenon of earth, an

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,480
element of earth.

76
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:49,040
Because again, element of earth as a remote descend, possibility is present in everything.

77
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,960
And the mind stays on that while the experience kind of descends down on the more particular

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
eye levels.

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:07,400
So it's been quite a little more there, perhaps the separation that I think is important

80
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
to clarify is what is the difference.

81
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,520
Let's stay with the forest in versus the town for sure being.

82
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,760
So I'm in town trying to add on perceptions of the forest.

83
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,040
What's the separation between that and just kind of like not paying attention to daydream

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,760
in that I'm in the woods?

85
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, that's when the mind ceases to be established, and then it becomes just daydream of being

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
in the woods.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,520
So it's in a matter of, at that moment, time might be attending to the woods in a particular

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
kind of way instead of attending.

89
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,000
If the mind is established, then you're properly attending to the perceptions of the absence

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
of people in the woods.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If the mind is not then, yeah, then it's just fantasy.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,800
And then you won't be establishment and then you will not be impenetrable by the things,

93
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,280
perceptions that occur in the city of the village.

94
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,840
So that's when the mind, like you can still be kind of revolving on the same mental images,

95
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,080
but the mind is not developed in regard to them.

96
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,480
It's not established in regard to them.

97
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:14,880
The mind has descended down where the eye is, where the ear is, nose and so on.

98
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:23,440
The idea of having the mind on a quote unquote higher level made a little bit more sense

99
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,480
to me, the idea that you can be, you know, talking to people while at the same time the

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,760
mind doesn't necessarily have to get disturbed, yeah, disturbed by that.

101
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,720
It's not an easy thing, but it's never going to stay for him, not at all.

102
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,760
And that's what my development is in the sutras, samadhi, and all the other level here,

103
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,240
establishes my perception of light, infinite space.

104
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
It's exactly that.

105
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,040
You can just take it to various degrees, all the way up to the cessation of perception

106
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,040
and feelings.

107
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,000
So, the same kind of establishment goes into play with, like, you know, you just mentioned

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,720
perception of light, which is typically, you know, the end to the third end doing soft

109
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
torpor.

110
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Yeah.

111
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Yeah.

112
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,880
So, it's kind of the same idea you're saying of establishing the mind on a perception of

113
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
light.

114
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,520
We're talking about light in terms of light, light, bold light.

115
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Light.

116
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
A phenomenon of light.

117
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,520
It's in day, which is in the dark, as the absence, which is in the light bulb, where I can't

118
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
light.

119
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
That's the thing.

120
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,520
It's not a particular object that emits light.

121
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
It's not staring into a light bulb.

122
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
No.

123
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,280
No, is it staring at the play disks to establish the mind upon the element of a light, which

124
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,720
is what people do, to consider the pucks.

125
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,720
I understand that there is a phenomenon of light that emits light, absence of light, but

126
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
it's still a one-round light.

127
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Yeah.

128
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
It's establishing the mind on that the same way that overcome sleepiness, somehow.

129
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Sure.

130
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,920
Or to not own sleepiness, not without sleepiness, because sometimes the body might be genuinely

131
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
sleeping.

132
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,400
But obviously, if you take it up, then it becomes your sloth and torpor, but if it's not

133
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
then it's just the body start.

134
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,560
And then you might actually stay awake, because you realize what it is, or you might sleep

135
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
a very little.

136
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,240
Or you might sleep a lot if the body was really tired, but you won't be sleeping out of indulgence

137
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:50,240
in that sleep, and indulges in that ignorance, because the mind remains established.

138
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Right.

139
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:01,720
We're about unattractiveness, perception, interaction, looking at the practice of 32 parts

140
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,240
of the body, and the perspective of the body.

141
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Which takes away lust.

142
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Yeah.

143
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,240
So you're not running on the aspect of beauty?

144
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
You think so?

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,240
So it's the same thing.

146
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,320
It's the same body, same thing.

147
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,640
That can be regarded in a manner of infatuation, with lust, or can be seen as actually quite

148
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
impulsive.

149
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,560
But because people have an inherent assumption of the value of pleasure, you just always

150
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,000
automatically give your attention to the beautiful aspect of it, and you don't want to think

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
about what it being caused.

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Gross.

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,600
It's not, it's not nice.

154
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,000
And that's what the last develops, right?

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,720
So over the point, it's not just the stare at corpses or bodily organs for themselves.

156
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,560
The point is to see those very things as things that you do regard as beautiful.

157
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,960
So simultaneously, to see them as beautiful, these other things, and that will undermine

158
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,960
the notion of beautiful, that usually grips the people's mind.

159
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,480
To remind, we have always said that the dimension of the other mind is quite, I think, called

160
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
the master perceptions.

161
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Like you can see that beautiful in the mirror.

162
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Not really.

163
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Not really in beautiful sense.

164
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah.

165
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,680
It realizes that the potential for the perception is all in the zombies, which is a matter

166
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,080
of which one is intended to.

167
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,400
Because that's exactly the point, like in beautiful, there is the underlying ugly, because

168
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,440
you can be regarded as a possibility of an ocean of ugly.

169
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,800
And same, ugly can be regarded as beautiful in reference to something else.

170
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,560
It's just that people's mind get gripped by the notion of beauty and loves to immediately

171
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
invade it and spread it further.

172
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,720
For an hour on, it's free from lust, heal him up.

173
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,560
This is a beautiful object that he can see through as ugly.

174
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,640
This is an ugly object that he can see through as beautiful.

175
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,440
Either way, there won't be only lust in between the two of them in regard to it, but it's

176
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,640
on a different level, I think.

177
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Yes, yes, yes, me if I'm wrong.

178
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Yeah, absolutely.

179
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
It's not.

180
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Like, when there is beautiful, ugly is on the level of a possibility on it, which means

181
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
it's more general.

182
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,640
When it's ugly, its beauty is on the level of possibility.

183
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,360
There is a single tenuous present.

184
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,920
That's why the mind can be developed in regard to both, making the peripheral more present.

185
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,240
Discerning the peripheral, while discerning the peripheral of the general ugliness, repulsiveness

186
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,360
in regard to this particular beautiful thing that has a reason.

187
00:12:49,360 --> 00:13:03,720
I think there is another source, which is more ugly for beautiful world, doesn't it?

188
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:12,120
Well anyway, I think you can infer that by yourself, if you just, as a whole, the world

189
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,160
as a whole, you experience as a whole, if you look at it, you'll see, well, there are

190
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,120
more ugly things, the more things that you don't want to look at.

191
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,200
And then you know that we've always been selectively picking these particular things that we

192
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,600
found beautiful.

193
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,200
So ugly, but being more general, we'll always remain like a foundation for the beautiful.

194
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,800
You know, you have to do is remove the last thing in regard to beautiful, and then that

195
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,280
relationship becomes apparent.

196
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,080
And then you, you know, you won't have to be staring at ugly things to remove your

197
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,440
last thing, because you never removed it, you removed it in regard to beautiful things.

198
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,120
So then it's just, if it's ugly, you know, it's ugly, it's beautiful, you know, it's

199
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
beautiful.

200
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,120
But again, there is no last thing in regard to it, because you know, within that, it's

201
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
actually quite repulsive.

202
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,960
Nothing is worth being lasted after.

203
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,120
Do you have to intention to find the subtracted aspect?

204
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,880
Well, the tetralation, yeah, yeah, because by giving in to the last thought, it's beautiful,

205
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,120
you automatically maintain ignorance, ignoring of the other.

206
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,240
Because if, if ugly in the beautiful are given at the same time, yeah, you will be repelled

207
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
by both.

208
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,920
So in terms of 30 points, he reviews his body from the totally negative souls of his people.

209
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:33,160
Each, each part he reviews, he reviews it in relationship to the general notion of body.

210
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,480
There is regard of his mind, there is regard of his beautiful, his strong, his healthy,

211
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,160
his everlasting, and whatever else.

212
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,600
He doesn't go through like systematically just listing organs for the sacred, listing

213
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
organs.

214
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,240
So when he's thinking about the organ of the eye, ear, nose, skin, nails, each of them individually,

215
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,640
he thinks in relationship to the body as a whole.

216
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Why is it ugly?

217
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Which, what do you mean?

218
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Well, it's ugly because it's intolerant.

219
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah.

220
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
That's why it's ugly.

221
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
That's why it's ugly.

222
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
That's why it's ugly.

223
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Yeah.

224
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
It's ugly.

225
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
This is.

226
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
Insult of it.

227
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
No, no, no.

228
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Lost it after.

229
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
It's not mine.

230
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
It's.

231
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
It's not mine, yeah.

232
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
It's ugly.

233
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:22,720
So you think it's not much, so much amount of liver is nasty looking, but it's just not

234
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
accessible.

235
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Exactly.

236
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Exactly.

237
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Exactly.

238
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Exactly.

239
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,520
And that's usually what a person would get when he encounters something ugly, something

240
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
repulsive.

241
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Oh, I don't want this.

242
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,760
So you start looking at the liver, at the brain, as I don't want this in relation to

243
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,760
that notion of the body as a general thing.

244
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Oh, there.

245
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:08,760
And that's often the problem that people would get with a super practice in meditation.

246
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,760
It would be in the beginning.

247
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,840
They might see the relationship between every individual part or a dead body or anything

248
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
that they're practicing.

249
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
There's a contemplation.

250
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,760
They might maintain the mindful relationship between the sense of their body, but that tends

251
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:31,120
to kind of fall out, fall away, and then it's a sense of like trying to revoke disgust

252
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
for the sake of disgust.

253
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,800
But that's equally, can be equally misleading.

254
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm trying to think about a pretty girl and they're like, oh, she's made of organs.

255
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Yeah.

256
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Yeah.

257
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,120
She is, but that's the thing.

258
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,640
But you want to see actually that even you seeing the pretty girl, that which kind

259
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,440
of precedes the sight of the pretty girl, is made of those unwanted and accessible,

260
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,720
disgusting organs.

261
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,800
And then there won't be any ground left for lust to kind of linger on.

262
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,720
Neither in regard to the scene, nor in regard to that because of which there is scene.

263
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,320
Which is a presence of this conscious body here.

264
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,800
It comes back to preceding existence, structurally preceding it.

265
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,160
And it's helped by understanding that lust becomes impossible.

266
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,200
Not knowing that, that's the best for lust.

267
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,520
That's when you refer to parasite.

268
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,120
It's not supposed to be there, but it's there.

269
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,200
It's been a few minutes because when I first started reading the bosom, you know, there's

270
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,000
that one sutra, I think, Munchen and the Kaya, 119, if you're into the mindless of body

271
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
sutra.

272
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Uh-huh.

273
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Talks about how you could use mindless body to even attain the bondage.

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm like, how could you do that one about the mind when you think about the body in this

275
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,640
kind of way that we're speaking?

276
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Yeah.

277
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
It makes perfect sense.

278
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Absolutely.

279
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
Yeah.

280
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
And that's why we were meant.

281
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
It's called universe.

282
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,760
It's contained in this body.

283
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,800
Not in the scientific body, main of organ, but in this notion of body, this experience

284
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:16,120
of body, which does precede things that I kind of infer from it, the world and the

285
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
end of the world.

286
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Yeah.

287
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:31,240
Is it you guys after the thirty-five somebody to expect the cork sensation in that same

288
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,720
sutra by telling my time in the area?

289
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:44,240
And, you know, you look at a body wrunching in various stages and then one says, you think

290
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,000
yourself just that body is the same, this body will be the same, this body, just my

291
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,760
body, this body will be the same.

292
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,960
And there's a bridge that can seem to be as opposed to looking at the body parts.

293
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
So what does that come down to?

294
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,120
While you're looking at a decomposing body, you simultaneously regard this body as that.

295
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,680
What is the level of a mental exercise in parents or so on, but basically by seeing, while

296
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,640
I'm seeing this, this is that nature.

297
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,760
This body shares that very nature and then the last is removed.

298
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,280
But if it's not seen at the simultaneous level, so to speak, then it's not done properly.

299
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
That contemplation.

300
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:45,760
So the external body that's decomposing, it's basically the nature that is the nature

301
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,880
of this which I regard as my internal body.

302
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
That's the internal body, basically like that external body.

303
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,320
That's where it's internal external, both internal and external.

304
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,120
The body is there of such nature and you remove any, well, ignorance in regard to it

305
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,280
and consequently, obviously, these are in the last, they would be lingering around the

306
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,720
notion of pleasant and the beauty.

307
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,120
And you're saying these are in the last, you mean that, like in the most broad sense?

308
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
In the most natural sense.

309
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,720
Not exactly in the last, yeah, just like people have these are in the last in regard to

310
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,800
their own body because they pursue side sounds, melt their touches, which means you maintain

311
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,560
the basis of those things, which is your very body, your senses.

312
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,280
Because those things are on fire as well.

313
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,880
Everything is caught up by the fire on lust.

314
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,320
And that's why because you depend on the beautiful sights, your life revolves around it,

315
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,160
you'll be terrified of the notion of losing your eyes, you'll figure out if I go blind.

316
00:20:47,160 --> 00:21:02,560
And it equals death, you think about the diseases, you can have, yeah, different things that

317
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,840
could come into your way at any point.

318
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,760
Just the fact that those things are possible means the body is liable at any time.

319
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,240
The fact that the body is liable at any time means you're not in control because if you're

320
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,320
in charge, you would remove death liable.

321
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Only something that you cannot control, you cannot own is liable to things you don't want.

322
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,080
That's it's not yours for that very reason.

323
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:38,560
But people don't dwell long enough on what body is liable to, to age, get sick and die

324
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,360
because if they were, they would experience the special regard here and then the special.

325
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, it's dangerous for me to remain regarded, this is mine.

326
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,200
And like kind of establishing my entire life around it can be swept away with a simple illness

327
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
next day.

328
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
And that's it.

329
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Falling bolted.

330
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Falling bolted?

331
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Okay.

332
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Trip over a rock.

333
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Beating by a snake.

334
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Everything.

335
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Everything.

336
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Every heart stop.

337
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
For no particular reason.

338
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
And that's how it looked like.

339
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
There you go.

340
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,880
Many people start experiencing anxiety, attacks, whatever they become aware of that, beating

341
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
up.

342
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
And the chest.

343
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:23,200
Because you realize your entire life, everything, dear to you, all your hopes, plans, experiences,

344
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,280
whatever, depends on this completely independent, simple muscle pump inside your chest.

345
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:38,520
You have absolutely no way of even controlling, contributing and just going to get involved.

346
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:45,000
And if that stops pumping, that's it, everything is done, it's kind of swept away with it.

347
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,240
So your whole life depends on something utterly, like a ticking organ, and you can't even

348
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
conceive controlling.

349
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,240
You have these videos of mine sometimes where a person's like an event or talking, something

350
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
to kill over.

351
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
It's brain enders.

352
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
No.

353
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Same thing.

354
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:14,440
Yeah, it's like the brain basically explodes, it's just done, it's blood, it's something

355
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
to blood.

356
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,920
And that's the nature of the body in general.

357
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,520
I mean, we know because of the medical science that, you know, the heart is the kind of dominant

358
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,520
pump that maintains it and so on, but overall, it's the nature of any aspect of the body.

359
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
It's hard to control.

360
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
It's on the same foot.

361
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
So what do you regard the heart?

362
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
That's the unattractiveness.

363
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,360
You know, what do you regard the heart, contemplate the heart, the brain, or the body as a whole

364
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,360
in general, or just the notion of health and life as a phenomenon?

365
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
It's all the same thing.

366
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
It's the same contemplation.

367
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,560
It's you're even moving by simply dwelling in the fact that you cannot be in control even

368
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:01,280
if you want, which means it's not even possible to be in control of this, left alone after

369
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
you're in control of it.

370
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
So there's just some practices.

371
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:15,280
I think we'll have a chance to say to one more, keep these pieces in a jar when you're

372
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
thinking about it's broken, that hurt.

373
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,280
You want to just worry about the child, but it's not this, which, you know, can be helpful

374
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,520
with that person at the time, but that can seem to be practice, where you think about

375
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,440
the stink, where there's an experiment, and really, those things which genuinely most

376
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:45,520
you'll find, you've probably seen it, that's another level of the fact of non-control,

377
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
rather than...

378
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:53,120
Well, if a super is done rightly, it could lead to the dispassion which will become, and

379
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,040
then they will reveal the novel, because it's really not in my control.

380
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,680
So a super done rightly brings the clarity, and clarity of understanding, which is understanding

381
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
that you're not in control.

382
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Not the discussed.

383
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,840
Not discussed, and not like, oh, you do a super when you need to cancel the last, but

384
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
you need to cancel the last, because you haven't included the last.

385
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,920
So you don't want to revolve around just constantly managing the last, when the last arises.

386
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,720
Sure, when the last arises, you manage it, only so that you can then carry on further

387
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,040
and uproot it, so it doesn't arise.

388
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,920
And if a super is done rightly, it will really lead to accruting it, but most people use

389
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,040
it just as a management, and which means they're not using it right here.

390
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:46,040
It's just like, yeah, they are there, we saw the bones, the meat, the meaty bones, the

391
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:53,280
carnage, and then you get a sign of that meaty carnage, yes, the meaty bones, yeah, carnage.

392
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:59,280
And I'm saying, it looks like just put you by a road accident, which is destroyed, shattering,

393
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,280
and that's what this body is, that's what dog body is, that's what I was worried about,

394
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
yeah.

395
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
This joint is flesh.

396
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Yeah, that's it.

397
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:12,480
So because of that, there is, as a sort of say, the conceiver and the perceiver, there

398
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,640
is the mistake, because these things are reason, the senses, the sense organs, are the material

399
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,400
things in the world, because of which one perceives and conceives the world, because obviously

400
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:34,840
one perceives and thus conceives the demons, with non-desermot, with appropriation.

401
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,720
So you can never, that perceiver and conceiver, can never access, well, anything but them,

402
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,800
but most obviously cannot access any of the sense bases, because the sense bases are

403
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,600
that, because of which there are side sounds from out there's touches, and then thoughts

404
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,120
in regard to that.

405
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:01,720
So you can't see, your eye can't see itself as that meaty, fleshy, oily, slimy, order,

406
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
become.

407
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,400
That's why by seeing other eyes, or other organs, or other material things on the same domain

408
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,640
as not yours, you can then discern that this, which is similar to Mr. President, cannot

409
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,360
be seen in the same manner, because it's always, in that sense it's always internal, or

410
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,840
rather in that sense it's always this conscious body, where you can fully discern that it

411
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,560
shares the same nature, and thus remove any lust and desire and appropriation in regard

412
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,960
to it.

413
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,200
But if you expect to see it as side sounds from out there starting, you want it, as if

414
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:46,760
people get confused, with kind of salient in general, because they're always, in a way,

415
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,760
they're negative, they can only be discerned in regard to the things that are positively

416
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
arisen.

417
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:01,360
Like you can see something and know the eye must be there, exactly, simultaneous with the

418
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,120
sight.

419
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,480
And even the knowledge of the eye is simultaneous with the domain, the knowledge of the domain

420
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
of the sight.

421
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:18,960
There's no time discrepancy, as if sense bases are there, and then things fall onto

422
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:36,280
them and you'll perceive it, no.

423
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,000
You mean perception of forest, as well, if you haven't, you would have to be in a forest

424
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
as well.

425
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah.

426
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,240
Because if you haven't, then you stay in a forest, and develop perceptions over forest.

427
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,640
And you don't actually do that up more often, those perceptions become clear.

428
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
That's why I put it here.

429
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,080
Go to the remote land, go to the forest, go to the woods, the trees, and so on.

430
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
No others.

431
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Yeah.

432
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Because we're actually physically making that effort.

433
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,920
You're putting yourself in such environment, a circumstance that with these perceptions,

434
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,000
the mind will, well, adhere to them, eventually.

435
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,120
Maybe not the first time, but if you know what you're supposed to look, what do, what signs,

436
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,280
natural dispassion, inception around it, then the mind starts discerning, the perceptions

437
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:32,520
of the forest, the perceptions of absence of people, absence of the common bases of

438
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:39,040
lust, absence of the sense of abundance, sense of objective abundance, that they lie for,

439
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,240
pleasing food, face, mouth, the absence of all of them, things that people usually lust

440
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,640
after, absence of that, you won't find that in abundance.

441
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,240
It was somebody who could go into wilderness, and the mind stayed in the city.

442
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,240
Yeah.

443
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:07,800
Well, that's the carefulness, the carefulness that comes from living in the forest, the attitude

444
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,960
of being really careful about what you know, what you're just becoming natural.

445
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,840
Because you're real, like, if you make a wrong step, you'd have to fly down the cliff,

446
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,880
like when we were coming down the cliff, you didn't have to make the effort, like this

447
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
mindfulness.

448
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,240
You were just mindful, you just, every move, everything you leaned on, everything you

449
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,720
grabbed, everything you put a foot on, you were just mindful, because you had to be.

450
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:42,200
You are aware of your body, and the, the afflictions of your body, the basic, you have to

451
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,040
grab food, shelter, certain warmth, health, nothing.

452
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Exactly.

453
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,640
And see, there are those things that most often people take for granted.

454
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,640
If we weren't taking for granted, you don't want to have to go to the remote forest and

455
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,440
climb the mountains and so on.

456
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,640
But it's so deeply rooted, it's so natural to take these things for granted once you

457
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
have them.

458
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,920
Then, yeah, you need these reminders to realize that actually, body, even a healthy, normal

459
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:17,080
body requires a great deal of maintenance and protection and sheltering, which is actually

460
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
a hard work.

461
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,000
But obviously, living inside the city, the cities where these things are provided, you

462
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,200
just take for granted because you don't think about it.

463
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,080
All you have to do is just remove yourself and that's it, and then you realize what kind

464
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,360
of maintenance it is.

465
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,160
How exposed the body is, even it's, you know, even when it's at its peak, it's better

466
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,800
still exposed, exposed to elements, exposed to energy.

467
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,840
And you can't say, you can't shelter them, you can't build a house around it, because

468
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,920
the house too is out on their level.

469
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,160
What other the body is out with their dead houses as well.

470
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,760
So it's just remains external, remains liable to all sorts of things.

471
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,960
And you can't change that.

472
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,460
You're right looking, you're speaking, but living in the house and sticking with your

473
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,960
father and so on.

474
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:14,560
There is a suitor, so I don't know, that's about this morning, about the forest.

475
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Uh-huh.

476
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Uh-huh.

477
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Venable Nagita.

478
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Welcome, crossing.

479
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:31,480
It's, there's two suitors about Venable Nagita, and he's, in the ungood to me today.

480
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
This is the one from the Sixers.

481
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,840
They're both summoning in the beginning, but different teachings, and there's slightly

482
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
different teachings.

483
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,040
This is the one in terms of the forest.

484
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Yeah, that's, yeah.

485
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
I was reading.

486
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Yeah.

487
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:53,040
So, uh, one occasion of last month was one doing one tour around the coast and together

488
00:32:53,040 --> 00:33:00,640
with a large Sunday, and then you reach the coast and ramen village, uh, named Ichon

489
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Nangala.

490
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
How does it call it?

491
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Gala.

492
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Ichon Nangala.

493
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
J.

494
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:14,680
The message went well in Ichon Nangala, uh, wooden thicket in the forest there.

495
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,240
The brown householders there heard it.

496
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,760
He said that they set a goat's mind, the son of the succulents who went forth from the

497
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,520
second family has arrived at this town.

498
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,920
There's not running in there, and the forest in the vine.

499
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,640
Now, a good report about the most, uh, master goat's mind has circulated thus.

500
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,640
That best one is at our end, perfectly enlightened.

501
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,040
These teachings, the Dhamma, the teachers of Dhamma is going to be getting good in the

502
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
middle and good in the end.

503
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,040
The right meaning and phrase of the reveals is spiritual life that is perfectly complete

504
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
and pure.

505
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,240
Now, it's good to see such a round.

506
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,440
Then with the mighty pass, the brown householders of their town took abundant food of various

507
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,840
kinds and went to the forest.

508
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,560
They stood outside the entrance, making an uproar and a racket.

509
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,880
Now, on that occasion, the Renable Marbita was the best one's attended.

510
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,880
The best one then addressed the Renable Marbita, who is making such an uproar and a racket

511
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Marbita.

512
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,680
One would think it was a fishman at a whole with fish.

513
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:28,280
There's a bunch of these are the brown householders of Ichananagaya, who have brought abundant

514
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,120
food of various kinds.

515
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,120
They are standing outside the entrance, wishing to offer it to the best one and the

516
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,120
Sangha of Bikres.

517
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,360
Let me never come upon Fain Marbita and may Fain never catch up with me.

518
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,280
One who does not gain any will without trouble or difficulty, this bliss of renunciation,

519
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,360
bliss of solitude, bliss of peace, bliss of enlightenment that I gain in will without

520
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:00,000
trouble or difficulty, might accept that mild pleasure, that slothful pleasure, that pleasure

521
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,320
of gain, upon it, in praise.

522
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,580
And may he do it lies, let the best one now consent about it, let the fortune of one

523
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,580
consent.

524
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,680
This is the time for the best one to consent.

525
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,540
Wherever the best one will go now, the brown householders of town and countryside will

526
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:23,120
decline in the same direction, just as when thick drops of rain are pouring down, the water

527
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,160
flows down a lot of the slope.

528
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,980
So too, wherever the best one will go now, the brown householders of town and country

529
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,160
will be fine in the same direction for what reason, because of the best one's virtuous

530
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:41,200
behaviour in the wisdom and the will and the keep repeats.

531
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,120
Let me never come upon Fain Marbita, he's not consenting, may he never catch up with

532
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
me.

533
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:54,760
And he goes on to say, here in my Gita, I see a Bikres, dwelling on the outskirts of

534
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,080
a village, sitting in a state of compulsion.

535
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:05,080
And then it goes to me, now the monastery attendant, who are novice, who are co-religious

536
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:12,160
in this co-religious, will cause that vulnerable one to fall away from that compulsion.

537
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,640
For this reason, I'm not pleased with this Bikres dwelling on the outskirts of a village.

538
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:27,080
I see Navita, a forest dwelling Bikres, sitting in dozing in the forest, and then it goes

539
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
to me.

540
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Now this venable one will dispel the sleepiness of the tea and attend only to the perception

541
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,400
of the forest, the state of the wonders.

542
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,400
For this reason, I'm pleased with this Bikres dwelling on the outskirts of a village.

543
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,800
Compose near the village with a client, because he's near the environment that is basically

544
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,880
prudent.

545
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,680
Non-compose sleep, he draws a lazy, but in the forest, well, eventually come out of

546
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,880
that sleep, he draws a lazyness, and then develop a proper perception of the forest, because

547
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,680
he still remains physically in the better environment.

548
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
The state of wonders.

549
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, the state of wonders, basically, when the mind is established upon a more general

550
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,240
thing, it's not diversified among more particular things that you get in the village.

551
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,680
So it's a state of wonders in relation to that, and not the state of wonders that a tree

552
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,680
hugging does and might consider uniformity.

553
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Yeah.

554
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Yes, actually.

555
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Yeah, exactly.

556
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,680
It's not diversified.

557
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:38,680
I see my Gita, a forest dwell in Bikres, sitting in the forest in that uncomposed state, and

558
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
then it goes to me.

559
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Now this venable one will compose his uncomposed mind or guide his composed mind.

560
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,680
For this reason, I'm pleased with this Bikres dwelling in the forest.

561
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,680
I see my Gita a forest dwell in Bikres, sitting in the forest in a state of composure, and then

562
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
it goes to me.

563
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Now this venable one will liberate his un liberated mind or guide his liberated mind.

564
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,680
For this reason, I'm pleased with this Bikres dwelling in the forest.

565
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,680
I see my Gita a Bikres dwelling on the outskirts of the village, who gained ropes, arms with

566
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,680
lodgings, medicines, provisions for the sick, desiring gain, honour and fame.

567
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,680
He neglects seclusion, he neglects remote lodgings in the forest and general pros, having entered

568
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,680
the village's towns and capital cities he takes up his residence.

569
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,680
For this reason, I'm not pleased with the Bikres dwelling in the outskirts of the village.

570
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,680
I see my Gita a forest dwell in Bikres, who gained ropes, arms with lodgings, medicines and

571
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,680
provisions for the sick, having dispelled that gain, honour and praise.

572
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,680
There's not neglect seclusion, there's not neglects remote lodgings in the forest and general

573
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,680
pros.

574
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,680
For this reason, I'm pleased with this Bikres dwelling in the forest.

575
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:56,680
When my Gita, I'm travelling on a highway and do not see anyone ahead of me or behind

576
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:05,680
me, even if it is for the purpose of defecating and urinating, on that occasion, I am at ease.

577
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,680
It's a praising forest.

578
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:21,680
You're making the effort, there's not neglecting it, and then even if it's not perfect,

579
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:29,680
even if a person is sleepy and lazy and tired or afraid, still, you still don't neglect it.

580
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Sooner or later, you come out there, and the environment is suitable as it is spoken

581
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
in the previous.

582
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,680
It's a great template.

583
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Yeah, it's basically, let's say, he goes into an empty heart, empty dwellings as this place

584
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:55,680
is empty of others, and then he accepts the same phenomena than he applies to himself.

585
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,680
This is empty of any self, so it's there as such, but it's empty of the owner.

586
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,680
But you do need that physical incentive, so to speak.

587
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Your body needs to be such an environment, so you can have the right inference, not just

588
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,680
like to think about it, but never abandon a crowd, or never abandon the proximity of the

589
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
crowd.

590
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,680
The engagement, the dependence, the relationship.

591
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Obviously, you know, you're not supposed to, and you don't have to, like, run away

592
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,680
and hide from people and never see them again, because if they were the case, well,

593
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,680
we would be allowed to stay around full-crow, around full, a little bit of a mountain,

594
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,680
and never engage because they did that.

595
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,680
But it was clear that no, living on the fringe and the outskirts, and then inspiring them,

596
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,680
either with your lifestyle, or with the teachings, if they want to hear them, and so on,

597
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
it's fine.

598
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
But don't neglect the seclusion.

599
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Don't now, like, forget the remote forest of boats, and just 24-7 stay around late people.

600
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,680
That's what means village, laylife, city, today, whatever.

601
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:19,680
So, when it's there, if it occurs, it's fine, but you don't neglect the campfire.

602
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,680
And you can see that for yourself.

603
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,680
The more you go to the forest properly, the more you want to go.

604
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,680
The longer you want to stay, because of that, that the template.

605
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,680
Which is, yeah, as you say, dangerous, as well.

606
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
Sure?

607
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Yeah?

608
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,680
There is a real danger there.

609
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,680
But I think the body is what's dangerous, not being in the forest.

610
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,680
The only reason things in the forest might be dangerous, like the elephant, or a leopard,

611
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,680
is because you have a body.

612
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,680
And the danger will only pertain to you, as long as you're taking the body to be yours.

613
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:32,680
So, experiencing the elements, heat, cold, wind, hardship, endurance, walking up the mountain,

614
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,680
climbing up the rocks, and running away from an elephant.

615
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
But not having.

616
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Experiencing those things, basically, with the right mind from this, just keeps hammering in,

617
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,680
that the nature, the main characteristic of having this body, exposure,

618
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,680
not yours, not in your control, it's out there.

619
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:00,680
So, by going through with it, with the right mind from this, with the right view,

620
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,680
you're removing any lingering lust, and the emotions of conceit,

621
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,680
or bend it in regard to the body.

622
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:19,680
Even, you know, even if you're not an old crooked man, something like that, you don't have to be.

623
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,680
And actually, yeah, if you wait until you're old and crooked, you go back and you want it.

624
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,680
You go while you can, so that afterwards, you can.

625
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Don't delay.

626
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,680
Yeah, it's set up, the forest, you might be set up in my distraction.

627
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,680
But it's not set up, yeah.

628
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,680
That's the ultimate sort of difference.

629
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,680
If you were to boil it down, there would be a difference, yeah.

630
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Distraction, non-distraction, diversify, unify.

631
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,680
Again, that mosquito is a treat for it, there's no personal thing against you.

632
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Yeah, there's no personality, no interaction.

633
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,680
You can put it on the mosquito, it's out to get you, but you know.

634
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,680
It's not, it's not.

635
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,680
Completely up and down.

636
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
Impersonal.

637
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
Impersonal.

638
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,680
Indifferent.

639
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Leaches.

640
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Yeah.

641
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,680
It comes back also, that idea that people's mind is going to fatalism with karma.

642
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,680
Again, anything happens because of karma.

643
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,680
Yeah, every single body.

644
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

645
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,680
Having a human body happens because of karma.

646
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,680
Yeah.

647
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,680
But what happens is that a human body, well, is a nature of a human body.

648
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,680
So indirectly, you're responsible to what happens to a human body because you were reborn.

649
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,680
That's your responsibility.

650
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:46,680
But accident is a valid reason for things to occur, circumstance.

651
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,680
You're again, indirectly responsible, why?

652
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,680
