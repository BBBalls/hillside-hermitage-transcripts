1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
So the first step is that if you know for yourself what's wholesome as wholesome, wholesome,

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,960
wholesome as unwholesome and then you can see increasing in you or decreasing you and

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,040
then you can see sometimes circumstances being responsible for it, sometimes not when

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,840
they are you know what all life exchange is in certain times, if they're not, if it's

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,040
not the circumstances to be blamed then you are, I'm not making enough effort or I'm becoming

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,840
careless or something like that, but either way comes down to being self-transparent and

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,280
you see through that and then knowing how to act because as I said if you see that

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,440
at like initial stage you don't need a great amount of effort to keep it on the course.

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,800
So for somebody sure too don't like this might be great but then also living in a secluded

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,800
is great, if I don't have a secluded and I'm living through them well I'll just keep doing

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,080
what I have because it's good enough, if I have secluded and I don't have to go through

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:15,240
them well I'll keep doing that, it's not black and white and it's determined basically

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:32,920
by your message that you need to be honest with yourself about and it's often actually

14
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:42,080
more about recognizing what unwholesome is because if there is no unwholesome you most likely

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,160
can practice wholesome when you're doing fun, that's the thing once you can recognize

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:57,320
the unwholesome and keep that at bay then I can start moving more freely and I might

17
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,520
happen if that's my thing to go through them, because there is no increase in unwholesome

18
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,920
and even the one that and then you can exactly within that you can start defining it further

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,160
oh not just that there is no increase in unwholesome, there is also a decrease in unwholesome

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:22,600
so I might do that more now, yeah, if you don't know what you're doing and you're just

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,160
trying to take an external form on an expectation that that would, well most of the most of the

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:42,000
practice is exactly that, but it's not such a thing, there is not such a thing as half

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:58,080
a practice for you, yeah good luck with that, but yeah, people who project

24
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,320
for other whom is place where the practice is, would hold on to the rules is practice,

25
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,360
would hold on to the etiquette is practice, would hold on to observances is practice as

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,800
a virtuous practice and it's nothing other than still about the Paramahansa, and those

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,920
same people would also think circumstances of practice, to monastery of the practice,

28
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,800
keeping up to the routines is a practice, never ever using any of those things like as

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,880
a basis to reflect upon their mind themselves choosing, intending, being responsible for all

30
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,400
of that in the first place, so that's why you know you can spend 50 years in roles as

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,640
a monk following all the routines perfectly, doing everything perfectly, but never have

32
00:03:39,640 --> 00:04:09,520
a moment of proper reflection, so basically as you asked before what if the seconds

33
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:16,520
are provided both, wholesome and a wholesome, it's a wholesome day, you know you might have

34
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:25,520
a pot of curd, shillunk and curd, and half of it is good, half of it went off, and it's

35
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,840
all kind of mixed, even good bit is off, because you can distinguish it, so you want to focus

36
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,840
on not having the increase of one wholesome, but not having the increase of one wholesome,

37
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,240
that's already wholesome, and then you take that further through your effort, refining

38
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,760
the circumstances, refining the things you do throughout the day, you take that further

39
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,320
so that it starts to bring in the increase in one wholesome, but again all of this turns

40
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,800
to the very general wholesome and wholesome, they need to be like that, general like that,

41
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,560
because that's how you recognize them, you recognize the nature of one wholesome, the

42
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:16,560
nature of wholesome, and exactly as we said before, for somebody walking around charikas

43
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,760
and pudongs, but then out of complete restlessness, or some romantic ideals, and you know lots

44
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,840
of monks do, lots of monks live quite a number of months really harder, and two dongs

45
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,600
or whatever else, and then they come in common civilizations, they fall apart, they get angry,

46
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,240
they get angry, they get lost, they get pissed, they disrobe, and you know what you've been

47
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,920
doing all this time walking around, you clearly haven't been practicing, because if you were

48
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,640
you wouldn't be affected by those unwholesome states when they do eventually rise.

49
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,280
So the whole point is, whatever you choose to do as a form of practice is to be fortifying

50
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,960
yourself, against the farmers, against the hindrances, and become stronger, and obviously

51
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,160
develop wisdom through that, but if you know somebody, again perfect monk keeps all the

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:23,320
things, sits eight hours a day, and then he dissolves, well, but did that do to him?

53
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:38,920
Maybe things that stir you up, and so you think, I'm fine, yeah, and people often would think

54
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,920
that, yeah, they would often think that if there is no transparency to recognize, okay, I'm

55
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,920
fine now, but would I be fine if those things would arise, they unwholesome things, would

56
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,080
they go into the city, going into the village, every day, for his arms, they have to keep

57
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
his strength?

58
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,680
Well, exactly, that's where you can see it.

59
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,480
Because you know, often people would stop and wonder, why are monks not allowed to grow

60
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,880
the food, because you can go and live on top of the mountain, drawing around food, and

61
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,960
never see anywhere?

62
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, that's exactly why, because lots of people use that as a form of escape, and never

63
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:22,560
develop any wisdom, and on top of that, means the dharma wouldn't actually be drawn to others,

64
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,560
but by being in some marginal contact, with lay people, with people who are not monks,

65
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,520
who are not practicing, they get to see it, they get married, and you actually get to

66
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,440
be kept in check, like yourself, you get to measure, you get to measure, you get to see

67
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,640
whether your hindrance is arising, decreasing, if you just live in your mountain, you get

68
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,640
used to that, you have your own comfort, self-sustainable, you don't see any, oh yeah, it's

69
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,880
nice and romantic, but it's quite likely you aren't going to be pushing yourself as hard

70
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,360
as you should, but these things will prevent you from being complacent.

71
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,000
So there needs to be that kind of, ah, okay, no, I do dependant people, so I can't just

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
run off.

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But you can't go now, you know, in the middle of it, you go and catch it in a bar, kind

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
of thing.

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,760
Oh, I'm going to test myself, if you're older, they have a mental state with testing

76
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,840
yourself, you're older, they're affected by the nature of those things, because if you

77
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,720
are not affected by nature of those things, well, if you're not affected by the nature

78
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840
of things you're testing yourself in regard to, you wouldn't need to test yourself.

79
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,320
Means, but if you're doubting whether you're going to be affected or not, that's already

80
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,320
a form of being affected, but if you're doubting, oh, with these sites affecting me, so I

81
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,200
go and test myself, means, well, you're already affected by that doubt.

82
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,760
And then you needed to prove that to yourself, ah, by going and testing, you're exposed

83
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,240
going to the town or to a bar to see how you're going to react.

84
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,040
That's just completely like a wisdom.

85
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,400
First of all, oh, I'm trying to overcome this, thus any exposure won't help, even in

86
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,520
a form of testing myself, why would I need to test myself if I know this needs to be

87
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,200
well done, and truly overcoming something is when you become indifferent towards it.

88
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,880
And then even the idea of testing yourself means, well, why would I need to test my strength

89
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,520
when I know I'm strong?

90
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,760
I don't need to go and keep flexing.

91
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,960
But if you doubt whether you're strong enough, then you have to go and keep doing that.

92
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,840
So what you want to do is not keep testing yourself in silly, unwise ways, you actually

93
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,640
want to remove the doubt in regard to it.

94
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
And that's it.

95
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:38,640
And for as long as I demand seal, nothing can enter to it.

96
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, so again, I'm a bit lost, but if I'm sitting in the crew team, and I can't,

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,080
yeah, I can't down, nothing's going on, it's just neutral, neutral feeling generally.

98
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:15,120
Yeah, I can easily become complacent, but I have to keep on looking where, where do I have

99
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
to keep going?

100
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,880
Well, if everything is, if there are no disturbances of any kind, you do have sutras, you do have

101
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,600
study, and you do have knowledge that you are not sotapana yet.

102
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,400
Which means there is a task for me to do, and all the circumstances are quite suitable,

103
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,480
so I need to do it, I need to keep doing it.

104
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,760
I think even a state of just.

105
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,320
Then once you become sotapana, get the right view, then it's purely about recognizing

106
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
wholesome and avoiding unwholesome.

107
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,000
And if you stick to it with restrained, with renunciation, with things that are required

108
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,720
for different people, for different mindsets, different predispositions, that's it.

109
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,920
If you stick to it, as Janavira said, by practicing neck and a sun couple, the thoughts

110
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,560
of renunciation and intention of renunciation, you become like a tower of strength.

111
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,520
And then, you know, the knowledge arises and so on, and the person becomes tired, over

112
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,000
comes sensuality and so on.

113
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,640
All this everything is to start with the right view, there is no practice, there is no right

114
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
view.

115
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Yes, yes, yes.

116
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,720
The right view makes the whole noble age of path, right?

117
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,080
There is no such thing as you get this, a bit of that, a bit of this.

118
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,240
So you have the suitable enough circumstances, get the right view, spend the time trying

119
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
to get the right view.

120
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,040
And you know, there are like, again, many different ways you can get to the right view.

121
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,000
Obviously, it's the right way, the same understanding of the same nature, but if people can

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,560
arrive through contemplating different things, contemplating wholesome and unwholesome, wise

123
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,000
and wholesome and wholesome, avoiding it, abandoning it, not tolerating, not entertaining

124
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
it.

125
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,320
When the mind gets like, it used to wholesomeness, you start recognizing it, you start grasping

126
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,720
the sign of your own mind.

127
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,240
And then, you know, the impermanence and other things become much easier to sort of see

128
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:24,240
in the right context.

129
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,720
I need to ask you, like, need a clarification about something, just that, I read and I heard

130
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:42,720
about this something called one-check-a-dama, basically sort of like, illusion or sort of,

131
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,720
basically, I don't know how, like, for me, it sounded like an unwholesome, unwholesome

132
00:12:49,720 --> 00:13:01,720
nature of a thought or a process, but there was this article, but it was written by a monk,

133
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,120
it was about having unwholesome, wholesome and a third to be one-check-a-dama, basically

134
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:15,120
when you recognize something to be wholesome, but in reality, it's unwholesome, for example,

135
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:25,200
like, let's say this dog, like, goes on and I'm trying to catch that hair and I stop it.

136
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,240
In a way, I'm saving the hair, so I do have good merits or sort of wholesome, but then

137
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:38,080
again, I'm stopping the dog, or in the process, I get the dog, right, right, and so what

138
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,080
is the, what's the question, what's the context of that?

139
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
What are you saying?

140
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm asking, like, basically, is there a third, like, that sort of thing, like, one-check-a-dama

141
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:57,680
is there, is it a third sort of act or sort of thought process, or is it still just unskillful

142
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
and...

143
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,080
A third as opposed to wholesome, unwholesome, and then wholesome and unwholesome.

144
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Yeah.

145
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,280
Yeah, there is, there is meditaries, the meditaries, and now the meditaries are no meditaries,

146
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:16,680
so basically saving somebody, saving the life of, again, something, something is more,

147
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
something's less.

148
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,680
So, if you just prevent the dog from eating by preventing him from killing a hair and

149
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,680
you save the life of that hair, that's obviously more wholesome.

150
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,760
It's unwholesome if you're going to end up committing, but it's not as unwholesome

151
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,360
if you kill the dog.

152
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,400
Well, if you kill the dog, that's much worse here, because you wouldn't have been killing

153
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,480
the hair in the first place, it would have been the dog.

154
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,600
So, again, you always need to look it from your point of view, from the point of view of

155
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,560
your action, like, you know, locked in the people when they say, well, what if I killed

156
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,560
one person who was about to kill 500, I saved 500?

157
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,880
Well, it wasn't your responsibility to save 100, but it was your responsibility to not

158
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
kill anyone.

159
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Yeah.

160
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
And you can't avoid that, as well.

161
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Yeah.

162
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,260
So, yeah, there are things that the neither pleasant or untranslatable, neither

163
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,480
militaries nor militaries, neither good nor bad, mixed.

164
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Be the both, or be the bad.

165
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:27,720
Yeah, the one-taker means, like, sort of, like, but why is there a relevant, I don't

166
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:34,720
understand what to, because there was, in that article, it was divided into three sections,

167
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,920
rather than having wholesome, or unwholesome, for, like, when it's wholesome, or unwholesome,

168
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,560
you know, if this is wholesome, this is wholesome, if it's not wholesome, to me, sounds like

169
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,040
that article was talking about, comma, and then the ritual, if we park of it, like, all

170
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,160
what you do, that is good comma, or your bad comma.

171
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:17,760
But, basically, the term one-taker means one-taker is in, like, dishonest, old, like, to

172
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:26,280
con some one sort of thing, like, so this dumbness, this, this, this, makers, are conning, or this

173
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
honest sort of.

174
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,800
But, again, it's always in relation to an act of one kind or the other, so I suspect the

175
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,400
whole article was written with that in mind, like, you know, because you are, I do good,

176
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,600
I'll be reborn in heaven, or I'm making merit, well, there are things that con you think

177
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,040
you're doing good, but you're not, but that's not what we've been talking about, in terms

178
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,880
of wholesome, and unwholesome, in terms of practice, is what you recognize where your

179
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,800
intention is rooted, whether your intention is rooted in greed, aversion, delusion,

180
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,720
if you recognize your rooted in that, you do not do it.

181
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah.

182
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,440
So in that sense, there is no neutral there, basically, it's either good, or it's either

183
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
bad.

184
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,640
Yeah, that's the problem.

185
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:10,960
And if you start seeing like that, recognizing that it's not rooted in bad, that's what

186
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,840
makes it good, good for the practice, that's what it means, suitable for the practice.

187
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:23,920
And from the point of view of karma, like if what you've done happens to be like this

188
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:31,400
or like, well, you've done that, but you will know for sure that it's impossible to have

189
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,880
an action, a deed done while it was rooted in wholesome, not in unwholesome, to result

190
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,520
in unwholesome, you can't have that.

191
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,960
So you kind of bring it back to the source, you stop speculating about this particular thing

192
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,000
means that, or if I do this, if you mean that, or, no, you just bring it really, really

193
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,320
to the source, which is your intention, and then you know, my intention was not rooted

194
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,760
in unwholesome, and you don't have anything to worry about.

195
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,560
But if you don't see that, then yeah, then you have to worry about external and what

196
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,520
other people say, it's good or bad, and then you're trying to get your way by pondering

197
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
on those things.

198
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,680
But actually, you just need to bring it down to the very point of origin, and then you

199
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
will know.

200
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:23,240
So, I think that's more about, again, about authenticity of it, it's absolutely prerequisite

201
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,640
for everything right.

202
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:37,920
It's like, you can think of something as you're doing wholesome, but you're ignorant to

203
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
a little more.

204
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:50,120
Yeah, I mean, you know, people think various things that are socially or in the environment

205
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,720
you live accepted as good and wholesome, but you can be doing it for completely unwholesome

206
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
reasons.

207
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,720
And it's those reasons that matter.

208
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Yeah, it's not the external, traditional way of people, what people say, no one knows

209
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,640
what wholesome and unwholesome is.

210
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,400
It's accepted based on, kind of, some general knowledge, but it's not something that's

211
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
on the cell accurate.

212
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Whatever you're asking to do, it might be.

213
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Yeah.

214
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Whatever is the case.

215
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Yeah.

216
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Oh, it's good.

217
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,040
This is the right to do it, but why are you doing it?

218
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,840
Like things can be externally neutral, nobody would mind, but you know you're doing it

219
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,480
for absolutely wrong reasons, so you're going to do it.

220
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,640
And sometimes things can be perceived negatively externally, people can complain, but you'd

221
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,360
know you're not doing it for the bad reasons, so you don't have to worry about doing it.

222
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:53,480
So what it comes down to is that, like, can I say, like, if it's wholesome, like, if

223
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,480
it's not wholesome, it is unwholesome, if it's not unwholesome, it is wholesome.

224
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,680
And it comes down to the mind where your intentions are rooted, like, if it's neutral, then,

225
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,920
okay, it's not unwholesome, that's all it matters.

226
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,840
There can't be a neutral position, can it?

227
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,320
Well, it can be, like, certain, like, it doesn't affect anyone, it doesn't affect you,

228
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,800
it doesn't affect others in any way, in any shape of form, it doesn't affect anything.

229
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,160
But what about your volition, like, the intuition?

230
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, even your volition doesn't really affect, doesn't care.

231
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,420
It doesn't come from my wholesome, it doesn't come from greed, it doesn't come from

232
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,720
delusion.

233
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,040
And in that sense, from the point of view of the practice, it's wholesome, that neutral

234
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:40,520
it's wholesome, because, well, it's certainly not an obstacle.

235
00:20:40,520 --> 00:21:00,520
So, in between greed, abortion, and delusion, and wisdom, generosity, and, like, the counter

236
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
of those three.

237
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,600
Well, the counter of greed, the version delusion is non-greed, non-version, and non-delusion.

238
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Non-delusion, yeah.

239
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,640
So, between those six, there's no other intention left, right?

240
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,760
If you're, if you're intending to doing something, either one of those things, or a modification

241
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
of those things.

242
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,920
In terms of where it's rooted, exactly, yeah, you have it by that, because, as you say

243
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,760
yourself, and as, you know, things in some case, there's a bit of mix, but the fact that

244
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:37,760
it's mixed, with unwholesome means, well, it's rooted in unwholesome.

245
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:46,720
Yeah, that's why I wasn't here a while ago.

246
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,040
And then if it's rooted in neutral, in a sense of, well, there's no greed, and non-greed

247
00:21:52,040 --> 00:22:01,040
either, it's just complete indifference, by being like that, well, that's, that's wholesome.

248
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,040
So, if there is no greed, it's a non-greed.

249
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Yeah.

250
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,600
If there is both greed and non-greed, in regard to various things, well, that's greed.

251
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,120
So the difference would come down to, like, the neutral feeling, for example, when it's

252
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,120
neither pleasure, nor this pleasure, it's being felt.

253
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,720
And it's actually a lot of the feeling, but if that feeling is not known, it's unpleasant,

254
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,920
it's delusional, it's unwholesome.

255
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:44,680
If that feeling is known, it's pleasant, and it's wholesome, and it's peaceful.

256
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,400
And it's, in itself, it's a neutral feeling, in that sense, you would have, like, a neutral

257
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,800
intention that doesn't result, neither in good, nor in bad.

258
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,000
But if it's unknown, as such, if it's not recognized for what it is, it's unwholesome.

259
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If it's recognized for what is, it's wholesome, oh, okay.

260
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,800
So it's like your intention towards your feelings.

261
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,680
Because the intention towards the feelings would be whether there is craving, if it's a

262
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,320
proper intention, there wouldn't be craving, it's improper, there would be craving, in regard

263
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,680
to whatever you feel, good or bad or neutral.

264
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,360
If it's a proper intention, there's going to be craving, what's the proper intention?

265
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,360
The proper intention would be intention that would not lose the sight of impermanence.

266
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:47,360
For example, okay, keep having, keep having, keep having, keep having, keep having, keep

267
00:23:47,360 --> 00:24:02,360
from having that in perspective, because it, there's that, what none of you ever wrote,

268
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:11,360
real quotes, I can't remember how to say exactly, any intention, which doesn't imply craving,

269
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,000
I think you understand?

270
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

271
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah.

272
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
An intention.

273
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
What is the, has the rest of the question there?

274
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
All that comment there.

275
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Well.

276
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
An intention that doesn't imply craving.

277
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,400
A half thing can be understood.

278
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,560
Because how can you say, why?

279
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:37,120
How can you intend something without craving, without, that's just the duties towards feelings

280
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,080
that one has.

281
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Well, basically the intention of effective ignorance will be

282
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,080
kind of over-intending, you can say, which is when you're craving.

283
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,080
But because there is no beginning of your craving, you've always been over-intending.

284
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,080
So the question is how to now learn through that over-intending,

285
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,080
through that craving for things, how to learn that actually intention can be

286
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,080
without you needing to over-intending or doing anything about it.

287
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,080
So it's more like discerning within that over-intending intention,

288
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,080
what in itself is just intention, and what is your doing on top of that?

289
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Well, what you're doing.

290
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,080
And recognition, for example, of the fact,

291
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,080
well, recognition of intentions as phenomena is the very first step.

292
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Yeah.

293
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Because most of the people when they think intention, they immediately

294
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,080
that's my evolution, my direction, like, oh, intending this, intending this.

295
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,080
It's always, it's like a direction, being directed that way or this way.

296
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,080
And you don't see that as in the reason of phenomena.

297
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,080
You see that in regard to being manifest in regard to reason of phenomena.

298
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Ah, this is the reason I'm going there.

299
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
This is it, I'm going there.

300
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Oh, I'm running away from that.

301
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
I don't want that, I want that.

302
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
So it's always this movement.

303
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
I'm thinking about this.

304
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:06,080
So seeing the movement of your intention as a still phenomenon is the very first step.

305
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:13,080
And that means grasping the sign of your mind, grasping the still sign of your moving mind.

306
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
The thing is of your mind.

307
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,080
Exactly, because changing while standing, the third characteristic,

308
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
that's what movement is.

309
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Whether it's moving away or towards, or away and towards whatever,

310
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,080
it's changing while standing or rather changing while remaining the same,

311
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,080
resisting while changing, depending on whatever translation you're going to use.

312
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,080
The point is, even if there is a movement, it can be not,

313
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,080
towards or away, that movement is a thing.

314
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,080
On a more general level, it's a single thing, single phenomenon,

315
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
that it's sort of moving, changing on particular level.

316
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
That's why the movement is possible, is because on a different level,

317
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
there is no movement.

318
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,080
If everything is moving constantly all the time, everywhere,

319
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,080
there wouldn't be movement at all, because it wouldn't be a reference point at all.

320
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,080
So recognizing the nature of intention as a movement,

321
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:09,080
but then being able to see that movement as a reason thing, while it's moving.

322
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:16,080
They will eventually, could lead to discerning, ah, the aggregate of intention,

323
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,080
the phenomenon of intention, means even the intention, even the most,

324
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,080
the quickest moving things of your mind, like this, that, this, that.

325
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,080
It's only possible, because it has a reason beforehand, as a whole.

326
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,080
And over that, you have no say.

327
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,080
So the only fact, you can move along a certain trajectory,

328
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:43,080
is because the trajectory has been given to you as a possibility to move.

329
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,080
And thus you can never create anything.

330
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,080
You can just go along with what has a reason, based on your choice.

331
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,080
And then you realize that even choosing left or right, or up or down,

332
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,080
is only possible, because all those directions are implied, given.

333
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
All those intentions are there.

334
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,080
So you're completely enclosed within that.

335
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,080
So there's many, there's infinite number of intentions,

336
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
or directions you can go.

337
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Okay. But there is the thing called intention.

338
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
But it can move indefinitely.

339
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,080
You can say, let's say there is an infinite number,

340
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,080
and infinite ways that intention can move.

341
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,080
But all of those ways, all of those movements,

342
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,080
are possible only if the intention has a reason beforehand.

343
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,080
If there is no intention, you can't conceive a movement of that intention.

344
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,080
And there's many intentions.

345
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,080
You can say there is an infinite amount of movement,

346
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,080
of the given reason intention.

347
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,080
So you recognize, if the intention is the necessary cause,

348
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,080
the phenomenon of intention, the presence of intentionality,

349
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,080
is a necessary cause for any particular intention to be manifested.

350
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,080
You recognize that any particular intention that you engage in,

351
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,080
intentional intention, volition, whatever else,

352
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,080
is completely subordinate, completely dependent upon,

353
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,080
completely determined by the phenomenon of intention being present.

354
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
And if you discern that, you would have,

355
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
well, you have absolutely no say,

356
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
and you can't intend the phenomenon of intention.

357
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Which means, you can't ever even conceive it to be yours.

358
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Yet, because of, upon that very thing,

359
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
that is inconceivable to be yours,

360
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
your whole volition, your whole sense of self,

361
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
your whole intentionality, stands upon,

362
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,080
and it's completely determined by an inseparable form.

363
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
So by seeing that, and you recognize,

364
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,080
no matter how hard I will something of it,

365
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,080
it cannot, it's inconceivable to be taken as much,

366
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
it's impossible.

367
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
But fully discerning that impossibility,

368
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
you'll stop taking it as yours.

369
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,080
You're making a choice.

370
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,080
That's very much as we used to think.

371
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
That's where your sense of self sits.

372
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
The fact that you're able to choose.

373
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
But that's not, like again,

374
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
it's such a point.

375
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
So even potusion, I can get a hint of that.

376
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
You might be able to choose,

377
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,080
but while you're not able to not choose,

378
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
because even when you say I'm not choosing,

379
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
you've just chosen that.

380
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,080
So you're completely,

381
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
not to choose.

382
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Yeah, if so, I'm referring to the choice

383
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
while you just chose to not choose.

384
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
There's another choice.

385
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,080
It was always a possibility,

386
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
if you chose to refrain from choice.

387
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
So you're always, which is wide,

388
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,080
which is exactly, that's the core of it.

389
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,080
The fact that you can't choose your way out of choice.

390
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
You can't intentionally stop impending it.

391
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,080
And that's exactly why you condemn to karma

392
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,080
and then the eventual results of it.

393
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,080
You can't stop performing karma.

394
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,080
You can't stop performing action,

395
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,080
which means you can't stop experiencing results

396
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,080
no matter how far ahead they are.

397
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
And that's why every intention,

398
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
every action is intention.

399
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
So if you condemn to such intentions

400
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
that you're no escape from,

401
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
means, oh, result will be,

402
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
it will result in action eventually,

403
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
which means, oh, whatever then results

404
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
of those actions are,

405
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
will fall onto me,

406
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
even if I have no say over that.

407
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
And you never had say in it from the beginning,

408
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
but by not knowing that,

409
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
you just kept doing it,

410
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,080
and kept appropriating it,

411
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,080
which means whatever came as a result of it later on,

412
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,080
was also falling on your, on your, on your end.

413
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,080
So all acts have results,

414
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,080
but born Abraham, they don't.

415
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Well, on to anybody.

416
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Every action is intention,

417
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,080
but then if you fully discern intentions,

418
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
none of those intentions will be yours.

419
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Does anything that those intentions result in?

420
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
No.

421
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Any acts don't actually,

422
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
won't be actually act,

423
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
because act, in a sense of karma,

424
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
is when the intention is appropriated

425
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
and they brought you to result in committing

426
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
an action of a kind,

427
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
which means then the results of those actions

428
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
will also be yours.

429
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
They will still be results.

430
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
So you can't, like you can say,

431
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
I'll stop performing actions,

432
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
because action karma is bad.

433
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
But if you don't address,

434
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
if you don't overcome,

435
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,080
if you stop appropriating your intention,

436
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,080
means you're not really abstaining from any action,

437
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
because from that point of view,

438
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
even not performing an action,

439
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
is a form of action.

440
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
That you find it.

441
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
Yeah.

442
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
And sooner or later,

443
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
you will be, you'll do something

444
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
that will be resulting in one way or the other.

445
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
You can't see,

446
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,080
you can see intention directly.

447
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
You can't, you can't.

448
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Well, you can see the movement,

449
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
like if you're expecting to stop the intention,

450
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
to stop the movement in order to examine it,

451
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,080
means you're already looking at the wrong place.

452
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
You can't have anything in there.

453
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
The fact that there is a movement means

454
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,080
there is the phenomenon of movement

455
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
that is still,

456
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
basically, literally,

457
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
the trajectory you move

458
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
has to be given beforehand.

459
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Otherwise, there is no movement.

460
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
So you don't have to stop the movement.

461
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
You just have to recognize its nature,

462
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
which is not moving.

463
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Hence, the movement within that is possible.

464
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
Well, you, for, um,

465
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
intention,

466
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
because, because,

467
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,080
like if you want to phenomenologically describe it,

468
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
it would be a movement.

469
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,080
It's a movement,

470
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,080
movement of the mind,

471
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
movement of the speech,

472
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,080
movement of the action,

473
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
for the body,

474
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
depending on how far it takes you.

475
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
And the choice is a movement,

476
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
because of this, over that.

477
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
And while, because while you,

478
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,080
you have chosen something,

479
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
you choose something,

480
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
and it's,

481
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
and it's a bit...

482
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,080
Well, that already implies

483
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
the other things that you didn't choose.

484
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Yeah, but while I'm,

485
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm sitting now,

486
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
but I'm doing that,

487
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
so the mind,

488
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
intention to sit,

489
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
remains,

490
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
as long as I,

491
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
don't choose something else.

492
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
It's able to require you to stand up.

493
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Yeah.

494
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,080
So I'm constantly,

495
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
if I wasn't choosing to sit down,

496
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
I would be doing something else.

497
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
Yeah.

498
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
And now,

499
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,080
you have made a choice of sitting down.

500
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Now, you're not actively,

501
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
constantly choosing to remain seated,

502
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,080
but the fact that you've made that choice,

503
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
and your body is still seated,

504
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,080
means you're actively engaged in that choice.

505
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,080
Yeah, it's...

506
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
So you're engaged, it's active.

507
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
It's on.

508
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah.

509
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
Yeah.

510
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
Which is why the fourth,

511
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
um,

512
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,080
body postures can be, can be a good foundation of mindfulness.

513
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
Because within that,

514
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
now, any intentionality that you have,

515
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
will come from the intentionality of the seated body.

516
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Which means you can't,

517
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
all of the other intentionalities,

518
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
it would exist on account of a different body posture,

519
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
are now excellent.

520
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Uh...

521
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
You can't,

522
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
like now,

523
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
start intending things

524
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,080
that would require you to run,

525
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
or stand up,

526
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
without running or standing up.

527
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Mm-hmm.

528
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
So even if you think about it,

529
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
that's not really intention,

530
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
because it's not really as a possibility,

531
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
it's just an extra thought,

532
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
that you think,

533
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,080
from the point of view of seated intentions,

534
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
body in this posture,

535
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,080
has these things at its disposition.

536
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,080
But then, so what's the duty then?

537
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
So I'm watching my mind.

538
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
Well, the duty is,

539
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
you don't really have to be analyzing,

540
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
the domains of your intention,

541
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
and what's given,

542
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
and what's not. The duty is,

543
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
to see that,

544
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
whenever the movement is possible,

545
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
whenever the movement is occurring,

546
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
intention, relation,

547
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
it's only because things,

548
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
in regard to which you're moving,

549
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
are given beforehand.

550
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
As a more general thing.

551
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
I've seen,

552
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
impermanence.

553
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Exactly, thus,

554
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
any movement that occurs,

555
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
that will occur,

556
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
that has occurred,

557
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
is within.

558
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
It's now seen within,

559
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,080
that inherent impermanence.

560
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Which means,

561
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
you do that long enough,

562
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,080
any movement,

563
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
no matter how quick,

564
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
how fleeting,

565
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
or whatever else,

566
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
will not be taken as mine.

567
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
Why?

568
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Because it's impossible to be taken as mine.

569
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
So you dwell on it long enough,

570
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
and then it becomes apparent,

571
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
that there is no movement

572
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
without a still thing

573
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
being given beforehand,

574
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
for which,

575
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
just if I was given beforehand,

576
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
you had no say,

577
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
in its origin.

578
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
You're able to make a choice,

579
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
you must have things to choose.

580
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Yeah.

581
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Options, yeah.

582
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Well, yeah.

583
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
A nice option.

584
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Option would be more particular,

585
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
like proliferation,

586
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
but just if I did,

587
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
to be able to make a choice,

588
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,080
you have to be able to move,

589
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,080
mentally.

590
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Which means,

591
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
in order to move mentally,

592
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
the mind needs to be there

593
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,080
beforehand.

594
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
So instead of chasing the movement,

595
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
you actually use movement,

596
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,080
like as an indication,

597
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,080
of the fact that the mind is still.

598
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Hence, the sign of the mind,

599
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:31,080
chitta mimita.

600
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
And then,

601
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
then,

602
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
blow me nothing,

603
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
I put it's craving thing.

604
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Well, craving,

605
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
is possible for as long as

606
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
there is sense of eye out.

607
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,080
Then,

608
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
I am intending this means,

609
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
basically, I am craving this.

610
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
But once you start realizing

611
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
that it's completely redundant,

612
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
and that actually you can be

613
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
intending and moving

614
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
as a result of, you know,

615
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
five aggregates doing just that.

616
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
On their own,

617
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
not requiring you.

618
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Then you won't.

619
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Yeah.

620
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
You won't be needing to crave

621
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:13,080
anymore in any way.

622
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,080
Yes, well, suppose that the

623
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
equation comes up,

624
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
means I'm,

625
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,080
if I am not the one intending,

626
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,080
then,

627
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
who's going to be responsible

628
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
for the choices?

629
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Well, that's the thing,

630
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
that I'm going to make.

631
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
The question who implies

632
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
someone,

633
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
and the implication of someone

634
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
means, well,

635
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
the sense of self is still there.

636
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
So, whether you have

637
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,080
that sense of self as

638
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
internally or externally,

639
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
or both,

640
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
it's still there.

641
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
So, oh, well,

642
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
if it's not me,

643
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
who is it?

644
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
It means, well,

645
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
the general,

646
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
then the nature of the

647
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
self-view is still there,

648
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
because now you're looking

649
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
for somebody else.

650
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
But if you start seeing

651
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
that even that movement,

652
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
that looking,

653
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
that intending,

654
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
that thinking,

655
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
is possible because

656
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
things are given before,

657
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
you just start,

658
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,080
including everything properly.

659
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
And if you do long enough,

660
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
then it will sort of,

661
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
um,

662
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
cancel out the things

663
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
that were never meant to be there,

664
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
in the first place.

665
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
You sense of self craving,

666
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
you know that,

667
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
because now that is required,

668
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
it's completely done.

669
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
That's what Nihanna

670
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
really felt as a parasite,

671
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
upon gratuitous parasite,

672
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
but completely beginningless.

673
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
So, it's no first point

674
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
that ignorance is manifest

675
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
before which you were

676
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
not ignorant,

677
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
but actually,

678
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
ignorance is not supposed to be there.

679
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
It's not required.

680
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
Hence, when you know that,

681
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
you're not ignorant.

682
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
There is no,

683
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
no, no, no, no,

684
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,080
no, no, no, no,

685
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
no, space in between.

686
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
So, are either ignorant

687
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,080
or you're not ignorant?

688
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Knowing that ignorance has no

689
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
room removes ignorance.

690
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
It's mutually exclusive

691
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
video and I will show you,

692
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
come.

693
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
Knowing that you're seeing

694
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
things in the wrong way,

695
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:41,080
Well, knowing, for example, that you can't own things in the first place, not knowing that makes you own them, through that not knowing.

696
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Hence, a Vigia is responsible for your sense of self, for your appropriation.

697
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Knowing fully and discerning fully that you can't actually own them means Vigia is responsible for your disown and complete removal of appropriation.

698
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:05,080
And that's the thing, you will know that you can't own them and you see them fully determined always, by that which is a reason beforehand.

699
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:14,080
You are not saying that, which is a reason, or whatever arises would be determined by this, that has a reason beforehand.

700
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,080
So I can't even conceive to own it.

701
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:25,080
The only way you can conceive to own it is when you forget that it's determined by that which is a reason beforehand.

702
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:39,080
And the practices in discerning, and that's the whole particular part is discerning the connection between the two.

703
00:41:39,080 --> 00:42:00,080
And the connection is that connection of dependence, determination, being determined by, being inseparable from Sankara.

704
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Because it's not that there's nothing else in your experience than the five aggregates, by the Patryunal Narahand, whether you've been experienced, you're not.

705
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,080
It's just the five aggregates, one way or the other.

706
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,080
But you want to discern the way they arise.

707
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:32,080
So within that which you already have, which you've been experiencing, within that you need to start discerning the right things. That's why the correct instruction is absolutely crucial.

708
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:41,080
Like you can have all the right attention in your life, if there is nobody telling you what you need to attend properly.

709
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:50,080
How? You simply wonder, you wouldn't know how. Because there is no immediate confirmation whether it's right or wrong.

710
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Only after repeating it for five hundred thousands of times, then the confirmation, ah, okay, yes, I see this. I see the direct connection.

711
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:12,080
But you would be repeating something, five hundred or thousands of times, they doesn't bear any fruit initially. Only if somebody tells you that you should keep repeating it, they eventually will show it.

712
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:18,080
So that's why you can't stumble upon them accidentally. You can't accidentally become a sort of honor.

713
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:32,080
Oh yeah, all the luck. You just told the right thing at the right time. Impossible. You need to think the right thing at the right time for thousands of times. Just repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition until it wears out the ignorance.

714
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:41,080
When it's worn out sufficiently for you to see over it, imagine again, like a tall tree as you can see anything from whatever.

715
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:48,080
And then you're just hacking away and hacking away and hacking away. And you still don't see anything because it's tall, she's still.

716
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:59,080
But when you have hacked away sufficiently, you start to see. And then you know, oh, this hacking is actually working because now I have a degree of confirmation.

717
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:10,080
And that's all about it. You keep hacking further. Now you know for sure you have it confirmed for yourself that this hacking works in such and such way and you keep doing it and then eventually you'll see nothing.

718
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:17,080
You see what you need to see.

719
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:38,080
But if nobody tells you, I mean, you can stop the thing for yourself. If nobody tells you that repeating something away of attending things, away of reflecting.

720
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,080
If that is the right thing and if you don't have faith in what they told you, that's the right thing.

721
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:54,080
I mean, what are the chances of you yourself doing something right that you don't know that is right and then doing exactly the same thing on and on and on for no apparent reason.

722
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Perhaps you don't know the apparent reason because nobody told you externally, you should be doing nothing.

723
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:04,080
While everything, your whole experience is directly completely the opposite way.

724
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:12,080
It's impossible. It's literally impossible. That's why it's impossible for somebody to arrive at the right view just by accident.

725
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:19,080
So if somebody says, oh, yes, happened. I've done this monitor treat and it happened to me.

726
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:25,080
You most likely know they don't know what they're talking about because it doesn't happen to you. You develop it.

727
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:34,080
And if there's something, if something you develop, if there is something that you developed, you will know how you developed.

728
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:42,080
Thus, Sotapana knows that he knows. He's not just like, oh, yeah, it happened to me. I don't know how I can put it in the words, but it happened.

729
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,080
There's lots of nonsense. There's a spiritual mystical talk.

730
00:45:46,080 --> 00:46:00,080
But if you've done something for thousands of times internally and then you have to confirm for yourself that it works, it's freeing you from suffering directly here and now, then you will know that.

731
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:27,080
And you will know how to, no matter how not eloquent person you are, you still be able to say at least that it should repeat thousands of times how you've done it.

732
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:34,080
So that's why the utterance of another is one of the two factors for the right view. The other one is proper attention.

733
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:41,080
So you go the utterance and then you keep properly attending it on and on and on.

734
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:46,080
But if you don't have proper attention, you can have all the right utterance of other people all the time.

735
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:57,080
As you know, sometimes people did. They lived with the Buddha all the time but never became anything because they never properly attended.

736
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,080
Proper attention.

737
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:11,080
Proper attention is all this where we've been talking about. Proper intention.

738
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:22,080
But that's another thing. Like, you need to know, or you need to, well, I'm sure you know, but you need to keep in mind that it doesn't happen overnight in a sense.

739
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Oh, I just need to do it once rightly. It happens if you just keep doing it.

740
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:39,080
Like drilling, training, drilling.

741
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:46,080
Similarly, the similar of the axe handle in the soup is like a carpenter who uses his axe every day.

742
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,080
He doesn't know. Well, he said basically the wooden axe wouldn't handle. He uses it every day.

743
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:57,080
And then each time, you know, he grips it, he's wearing it down.

744
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:03,080
But you can't look at it and say, oh, today I've worn down my handle this much or that much.

745
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:10,080
Only after, you know, years of using it, one day you're looking, oh, it's really thin.

746
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,080
I've really worn this handle down. And that's how ignorance is being removed.

747
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:21,080
It's the same sense, same feeling. Like, if you just keep doing it and you keep doing it,

748
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:27,080
and then there will be a point where, oh, my ignorance diminished.

749
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:36,080
But you can't say on a daily basis, oh, today diminished this much. Tomorrow it will diminish this much.

750
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,080
You can notice how much you've been attending on a daily basis.

751
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:45,080
Attending, would you mean? Like, practicing.

752
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:55,080
Well, you can notice how much effort you've been putting on a daily basis, but you can't have a direct confirmation how much fruit that will bear.

753
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:03,080
When you do, then you'll be more confident in. Then you'll know, oh, yes. Attending like this has resulted in confirmed confidence now.

754
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:09,080
And then, obviously, you're your own guide. You know what to do. You know how to do it.

755
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:16,080
But until then, you just have to keep doing it and trying to make it as right as possible without knowing whether it's right or not.

756
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:24,080
Because that's the thing. If there is something you need to repeat for thousands of times and then eventually recognize it as right.

757
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:32,080
Well, you won't know before you repeated thousands of times whether it was right or wrong.

758
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,080
And you will know whether it was right or wrong only if it was right what you've been doing.

759
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,080
Because then you go to criteria whether it was right or wrong.

760
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:47,080
That's why it's so important to discern the instruction and really understand, try to understand and constantly respond and read the suitors

761
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:57,080
and talk with people you think they know the suitors, not just like the followers of the day or the day or the day of the ceremony, but really to try to understand.

762
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,080
Trying to understand can lead to understand.

763
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:12,080
But one thing for sure, you can't understand something accidentally without making an effort.

764
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:21,080
Yeah, but in able to see these things in the sense, you know, some people you can't be busy person.

765
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,080
No, you need to dedicate your life to it.

766
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,080
You need to dedicate your whole time to it.

767
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:39,080
You can't, okay, you start contemplating and really getting into that mode and then you know, your phone rings, you have to go, you have to do this, you have to do that person, it's done.

768
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:44,080
Then the effort will be getting back to the starting point.

769
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,080
Not even starting, it's getting back to the point where you can start.

770
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,080
So no, you can't be busy.

771
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:57,080
Not even this kind of life, wondering something.

772
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,080
Yeah.

773
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,080
Well, I think wondering would work if you get a right view.

774
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,080
Yes, yeah, okay.

775
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:13,080
When you know how to already attend things and then you would be attending because there are like, it's physical challenging, it's tiring, it's uncomfortable and everything else.

776
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,080
You get to see it.

777
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:25,080
And as nice as this forest is, there are lots of things that can bother one in many ways, insects, rain, rock, mud, whatever, whatever.

778
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,080
I don't know.

779
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:32,080
But none of that would be a reason for you not attending properly, once you know how to attend properly.

780
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,080
If you don't know how to attend properly, then yeah, everything can be a distraction for you, everything in the drug.

781
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,080
So you won't, that's just a far fly, I think, in my face.

782
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,080
Everything, everything can be a distraction for you.

783
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,080
So you really want to minimize that.

784
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:54,080
Still use the transparency that you have as putugina to know, okay, I'm not just avoiding things, I'm not just going out to them because I'm restless.

785
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:59,080
Or I'm not just staying in my country because I fear discomfort.

786
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:05,080
You find a balance of what you think is right, because you don't have a criteria that's right or wrong as putugina.

787
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,080
And then you just have to, okay, do I have time to read the sutras?

788
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Do I have time to meditate, do I have time to contemplate?

789
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:17,080
Whether I sit and meditate and contemplate, whether I walk, meditate and contemplate, I do have time, okay.

790
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:24,080
Do I have time, like what other is the environment supporting me, keep the seal, keep the winner, it is.

791
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:31,080
There are no distractions, there are no unwholesome things happening, that's those criteria as a matter, that's it.

792
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,080
That's more than enough for somebody to be making effort.

793
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:40,080
But then you know, you can be, oh, do I have enough time? No, I don't.

794
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:46,080
Am I not being this, well, I'm being disturbed all the time, but people, you know, mingling with laypeople all the time

795
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,080
because after this, after that, well, that's not wholesome.

796
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:59,080
Well, then you certainly won't be able to expect that you will have enough time to dedicate, like, contemplating the meanings you grasp from the sutras,

797
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,080
like constantly reflecting, constantly drilling, and drilling, and drilling.

798
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,080
Because it's a hard work as it is, you don't need any other.

799
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:14,080
So, yeah, by all means, before you get the right view, yeah.

800
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:19,080
Run away from the crowd, leave the world, whatever else.

801
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Then later on, you might see even more, oh, actually, I don't have to go this far from people.

802
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,080
I don't have to run on top of the mountain because I'm fine here.

803
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,080
The mind works well here. I can still be progressing here.

804
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,080
You definitely have to calm down and have a still place.

805
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,080
Until such time, you can be, you can dry enough.

806
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:48,080
Fair alone, like rhinoceros, the first, the first, the sotapan, the nyanavira quoted.

807
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,080
I've gone beyond the withering of the views that we put in the monument.

808
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,080
Nobody's my own guy. Fair alone, like, yeah.

809
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,080
Once you become your own guy, then fair alone, like rhinoceros.

810
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,080
Not before that.

811
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:06,080
Because then you'll be fairing like a dumb rhinoceros, pumping into trees and stuff.

812
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,080
Yeah.

813
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Yeah.
