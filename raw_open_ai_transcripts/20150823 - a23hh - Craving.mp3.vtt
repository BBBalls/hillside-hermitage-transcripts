WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.040
Yeah, what is craving maybe? Like I said today, that craving, understanding craving was

00:12.040 --> 00:20.240
seen, I was seeing it as very unattractive. So I started off with a super reflection and

00:20.240 --> 00:27.440
came down to, what is unattractive in all things as craving in regard to that is disgusting

00:27.440 --> 00:31.720
because of the things that it does. The things that it implies, things that it implies

00:31.720 --> 00:37.680
you get caught up in. Yeah. The self, the whole mission is everything. Yeah. So cravings

00:37.680 --> 00:44.120
is unattractive. Well, there is how it should be really. All of the things, what approach

00:44.120 --> 00:50.640
you take, it will end up leading to the same conclusions. And that's like how I don't

00:50.640 --> 00:54.280
have to come in. It's just, whatever, some people have become skilled in sense-based,

00:54.280 --> 01:01.520
skilled in this. All for the purpose of just revealing the same things. So you're not

01:01.520 --> 01:10.960
going to develop any new insights. You might develop new aspects of the same insights,

01:10.960 --> 01:16.560
depending on what approaches you take. But the point is you just, to pursue whichever

01:16.560 --> 01:25.320
aspect you acquire till the end, till the craving is gone and you're another. It's all

01:25.320 --> 01:33.320
the lighting. Well, yeah. It's kind of inseparable from what we spoke about the light in the

01:33.320 --> 01:44.840
nature of craving. If you take the light for granted, you crave. If you don't even

01:44.840 --> 01:51.720
see the light as phenomena, the reason, what is the light? The joy, the light. That's

01:51.720 --> 02:05.520
already means craving is there. So the important thing is to not fall into a trap of thinking

02:05.520 --> 02:12.920
linearly. Like, oh, first I felt, then I had the attitude of craving, then I'm delighting,

02:12.920 --> 02:18.560
then I'm as holding, then I get attached, then whatever there is now. It's all like within

02:18.560 --> 02:23.720
this, when this, this is, it's all the pateats of a father. So you might describe different

02:23.720 --> 02:29.080
aspects differently. But the point of it is that simultaneously present. So, presence

02:29.080 --> 02:39.320
of feeling means presence of craving for a putugina. And you can think of it, even in terms

02:39.320 --> 02:58.880
of, like what we spoke just a couple of hours ago, keeping yourself to, keeping yourself

02:58.880 --> 03:05.440
bound to a domain of centrality makes you not able to whatever arises in that domain.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.880
So keeping yourself bound to the domain of feelings makes yourself liable to whatever

03:10.880 --> 03:23.080
feelings arise. So even if you don't necessarily go after the feelings, the fact that you feel,

03:23.080 --> 03:28.880
that feeling is appropriate, that feeling is mine, feeling is me, feeling is I am, makes

03:28.880 --> 03:34.920
you liable to the other possibilities of that feeling that you're appropriating now. So

03:34.920 --> 03:39.000
when that changes, you won't be able to escape it. When that feeling changes, you won't

03:39.000 --> 03:44.200
be able to escape that change. So you'll be affected by it. In other words, if feeling

03:44.200 --> 03:48.480
changes for even more pleasure, you won't be able to remain indifferent, you'll be pulled,

03:48.480 --> 03:52.800
you'll be hooked in further. If feeling changes to explain, you'll be suffering, you'll

03:52.800 --> 03:58.560
be affected. And the fact that you are affected in the first place, that's what already

03:58.560 --> 04:05.080
what suffering is, that's what duke is. So the possibility, the fact that you won't

04:05.080 --> 04:10.440
be able to escape the possibility when it arises, that's duke. Why? Because you have no control

04:10.440 --> 04:15.920
of your possibilities. And that's the whole point. The sense of control can only be exercised

04:15.920 --> 04:22.640
in regard to a tactile. And then you can stop like thinking about probabilities and coefficients

04:22.640 --> 04:27.120
and blood, blood, blood, blood, just to give you the sense of control in reality. Possibility

04:27.120 --> 04:31.880
always remains a possibility, which means it can always be otherwise, which means your

04:31.880 --> 04:37.440
control is useless there. But the problem is, you're so used to control that you always

04:37.440 --> 04:42.280
see possibilities as secondary as optional. But actually, fundamentally, structurally speaking,

04:42.280 --> 04:53.000
they come before the actual thing. So, possibilities, not being able to control them, yet depending

04:53.000 --> 04:59.040
upon them, that's what the nature of Sankara is, exactly that very thing. If it termines

04:59.040 --> 05:06.840
everything yet, you have no say in it. Well, whatever you can determine, whatever you

05:06.840 --> 05:10.920
can determine, whether you can intend will be actual, which means there is always something

05:10.920 --> 05:16.440
possible in relation to which means you can ever like, uproot it through your intention,

05:16.440 --> 05:22.440
you can ever take it up and really own it. Because the act of owning is already determined

05:22.440 --> 05:29.640
by the possibilities of ownership, which you're not yours and cannot be owned.

05:29.640 --> 05:35.640
And understanding it, a feeling to get you out as a domain of yours.

05:35.640 --> 05:46.040
Yeah. Because you still feel that your view or your relationship is completely changed

05:46.040 --> 05:50.640
to it. Well, there, then you can't really say that you feel, anymore, you can just say

05:50.640 --> 05:59.360
feeling is there. But it doesn't exist, it's my feeling, which is what existence is.

05:59.360 --> 06:15.760
So, I try to imagine how it is, it might be like a death and then in a separation. I think

06:15.760 --> 06:22.320
my self will be winter, because you're feeling self is cold.

06:22.320 --> 06:30.080
Well, when you look from the point of view of self, it feels like death, because you can't

06:30.080 --> 06:38.480
even comprehend how can something be without existing. So, yeah, as a protusion that you

06:38.480 --> 06:59.240
have to die, protusion has to die. And back onto the craving. It's inseparable from the

06:59.240 --> 07:06.240
feeling. So, you can't just examine craving as a phenomenon separator. You can see the

07:06.240 --> 07:13.560
nature, you can distinguish, you can discern the nature, but it's simultaneously present

07:13.560 --> 07:25.800
with the feeling. But in order to discern the nature, to start discerning, the particular

07:25.800 --> 07:31.600
difference between different types of cravings. And I'm in psychological exam, exam, exam,

07:31.600 --> 07:37.960
just mean in pleasure, you have to recognize the nature of craving in regard to the pleasure.

07:37.960 --> 07:44.380
Now, just like theoretically, start pondering on what craving is. But to see it really in

07:44.380 --> 07:53.600
regard to the present, the arisen pleasure, and same with pain, and same with neutral

07:53.600 --> 07:54.600
feeling.

07:54.600 --> 08:03.440
So, the problem is when there's a pleasant feeling, people would dismiss the entire thing,

08:03.440 --> 08:10.520
throw the baby out with the bath water. So, degree of it is not a problem, it's just pleasant,

08:10.520 --> 08:18.200
it's just agreeable. What else there is what you do, that's what you should subduing.

08:18.200 --> 08:30.600
So, through feeling, you can recognize the craving with feeling craving, which is why

08:30.600 --> 08:39.120
it's partly, but it's on part of the description. While feeling craving, to be more accurate.

08:39.120 --> 08:43.320
Because again, we say with people is I think you're looking left and right.

08:43.320 --> 08:51.960
You have to be serious of feeling pleasure. Well, no, you have to kind of reverse engineer.

08:51.960 --> 08:58.080
You have to recognize the cure, okay, I'm a cotugina, therefore when I feel I crave,

08:58.080 --> 09:05.720
you don't see any of it. But that's the first thought, that's the starting point. Because

09:05.720 --> 09:15.600
I feel I crave. So, obviously now the first reaction may be, oh, I must not feel, but

09:15.600 --> 09:23.480
that's not a problem. The problem is that you crave. So, how can you feel without craving?

09:23.480 --> 09:29.920
If you find that out, you'll feel from craving, craving becomes redundant, because you can

09:29.920 --> 09:41.480
feel feeling irregardless. Feeling irregardless. Feeling irregardless of craving. But not knowing

09:41.480 --> 09:51.640
the craving is redundant, you crave. It's a pointless thing, it's a pointless endeavor.

09:51.640 --> 10:04.360
Yes, because no matter how much you crave for it or anything else, you'll never come

10:04.360 --> 10:11.760
about there, what you crave. Well, yeah, it's that also. And also, it's just because,

10:11.760 --> 10:20.320
yeah, the reason thing is indifferent to the flavor.

10:20.320 --> 10:25.480
So a thing arises in ceases, whether you crave or not makes no difference. So your craving

10:25.480 --> 10:30.440
is just like trying to interfere, but again, all your craving can ever accomplishes, again,

10:30.440 --> 10:35.320
arising in ceasing, that is indifferent to your craving. So that's why our craving

10:35.320 --> 10:43.360
can never be satisfied, yeah. But it can never even be, even the idea, the conception

10:43.360 --> 10:48.920
of the idea of satisfaction is completely ignorant, because it just doesn't even pertain

10:48.920 --> 10:52.880
to the same domain craving and feeling. It's not, if there were generally mixed, means

10:52.880 --> 11:00.280
craving could affect the feeling, but it can't. It's just feeling nothing to do with craving.

11:00.280 --> 11:10.960
So like the feeling is indifferent, it might even be to say too much, to make feelings,

11:10.960 --> 11:19.320
it sounds like feeling does care in a little way, it's indifferent, but it's so, you know,

11:19.320 --> 11:23.360
it's just saying something to everything different, it's almost saying too much, giving

11:23.360 --> 11:30.960
it too much of a concern, even. It's so actually indifferent.

11:30.960 --> 11:35.440
Yeah, I guess, depending on how you start designating terms, but when I say indifferent,

11:35.440 --> 11:41.640
I mean, I mean, like, economists, and that's what the economy means. It doesn't mean

11:41.640 --> 11:48.880
I acknowledge you, but I don't care about it. It means like, you just, it's impossible

11:48.880 --> 11:54.960
to even acknowledge you, and then we let you, like, in unshakable economy it is. And

11:54.960 --> 12:00.040
you recognize that aggregates cannot be acknowledged, nor can they acknowledge, because

12:00.040 --> 12:07.200
they're actively self enclosed indifferent to each other. So just the idea of them relating

12:07.200 --> 12:13.920
in any form can only arise from not knowing that they cannot relate in the first place.

12:13.920 --> 12:18.800
That's how you assume the relation, that's what Upadana takes out the aggregates through

12:18.800 --> 12:26.720
its own assumption, but they remain indifferent to it through and through for the whole duration.

12:26.720 --> 12:34.120
They can never actually be accessed or affected. So creating is one of the unnecessary pressure

12:34.120 --> 12:54.160
or jumping around. Yeah, unnecessary pressure, yeah, unnecessary lean, unnecessary kind of inclination.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.000
And again, in the same sense, you can measure your craving because you're feeling you can

12:58.000 --> 13:09.520
measure your suffering because of craving simultaneously presently inseparable. So if there

13:09.520 --> 13:16.480
is pain present on account of something, it's not actually on account of that thing,

13:16.480 --> 13:25.440
but it's an account of the craving that's present as it happens to be in regard to that thing.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.880
So somebody says something that upsets you. You're not upset because what they said, what

13:29.880 --> 13:35.400
they've done, whatever, what they've implied, but you're upset because in regard to that

13:35.400 --> 13:44.520
experience as a whole, you are craving. Since it's unpleasant, you're craving it to know

13:44.520 --> 13:51.800
not to be. So if you stop craving it to not be, the pain will disappear right there and

13:51.800 --> 13:59.360
then that very moment, which is why often people get some relief through saying, are just

13:59.360 --> 14:05.200
being the present moment or just accept things or just just open up and don't resist and

14:05.200 --> 14:13.280
so on and so forth. But that's not enough. Like you can do that once, twice, 100 times.

14:13.280 --> 14:17.520
You can do that whole life when you might have a more peaceful life, but that's not enough

14:17.520 --> 14:25.400
to bring understanding. Because you know, every religion teaches that we're very often,

14:25.400 --> 14:31.280
not every maybe, but quite often you hear that through various Guruji's or whatever else

14:31.280 --> 14:37.520
or just be present, just not as is just accept acceptance and tell you, just love a Christian

14:37.520 --> 14:41.880
love is a form of that kind of acceptance. You just love whatever comes your way and stuff.

14:41.880 --> 14:47.680
But see, that is a rather like overriding, that's overshooting view. No, you should not

14:47.680 --> 14:53.720
accept everything. You should accept only what you resist, but that which you don't resist,

14:53.720 --> 15:00.160
you shouldn't be accepting further. So you can't apply the blanket acceptance because

15:00.160 --> 15:08.720
there are different types of cravings. So craving is subtle than that. But then if you were

15:08.720 --> 15:15.240
to understand fully correctly with the right view of craving is, then that would be the

15:15.240 --> 15:19.920
end of it. You wouldn't have to do it because now you understood it and now it's gone.

15:19.920 --> 15:26.520
But the only reason you have to each time accept things once they have a reason is because

15:26.520 --> 15:32.320
there is no understanding in relation to their arising. So you still assume that they

15:32.320 --> 15:36.440
can be craved, therefore you crave, therefore you override it through acceptance and you

15:36.440 --> 15:43.680
let it diminish and then you feel dead. But it's like a psychological cycle almost.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.120
The dharma should take you to the point and should be developed as such and say, wherever

15:47.120 --> 15:52.880
you don't have to do anything in order to be free or in order to non-suffer. There was

15:52.880 --> 15:57.680
always something that guided me. It always made sense. I had that even as a lab person

15:57.680 --> 16:01.840
when I started. It was like, if it's a true piece, it's something that you don't have

16:01.840 --> 16:08.360
to maintain. If it's a true freedom from suffering, it's something that doesn't require me

16:08.360 --> 16:12.480
to keep doing it. Obviously, if you keep doing it until you reach it, but once it's fully

16:12.480 --> 16:17.720
developed, you don't have to. So anything that was falling short of that cannot be the

16:17.720 --> 16:24.000
ultimate truth. So if they say psychology or whatever, well, the pain arises or painful

16:24.000 --> 16:27.400
memory sometimes, well, you should do this and then you should do that and you should

16:27.400 --> 16:33.200
do this. And certainly, it helps in that linear psychological way. But the fact that you

16:33.200 --> 16:40.280
have to do something in the first place, that's already a problem. But they people don't

16:40.280 --> 16:45.000
see that usually. They just take that for granted and then deal with the problem. But the

16:45.000 --> 16:48.560
problem is that you have to deal with the problem in the first place. That's already a big

16:48.560 --> 16:56.520
problem. That's the biggest problem. That's what Dukar, this is, is. You are not it is

16:56.520 --> 17:01.400
because you know that there might be something you will need to do. You will have to do in

17:01.400 --> 17:09.200
order to be at ease. And that's making you uneasy. Yeah. So that's exactly the point

17:09.200 --> 17:15.800
when it comes to craving. You know, I have to do this and then you gently soften or release.

17:15.800 --> 17:21.440
It's just psychological battle that is revolving around the same view that it's failing to

17:21.440 --> 17:25.880
see that the fact that you have to do anything in the first place is already a big issue.

17:25.880 --> 17:33.000
It's the issue. All of this is circumstantial afterwards. But yeah, there is a degree of

17:33.000 --> 17:42.120
truth in like, oh, when there is a resistance anger or accepting it, not resisting it

17:42.120 --> 17:50.280
will cancel out the craving. But again, you can do that for the right reasons and you can

17:50.280 --> 17:54.280
do that for the wrong reasons. If you don't know what the deal with the craving and the

17:54.280 --> 18:00.320
feeling in there, if you have no concept of simultaneous dependence, but teachers and

18:00.320 --> 18:05.520
Obama, you never see, you never do it for the right reasons, which is why somebody can

18:05.520 --> 18:10.040
be quite evolved in that sense, but still be a protugina. He's still doing the whole

18:10.040 --> 18:15.440
thing. Rightly, he's doing the banner for the wrong reasons. So his sense of why he's

18:15.440 --> 18:27.840
still there. He's still there. He's still there. He's still there. He's still there.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.440
Well, painful feeling is painful because you're resisting. So you know, okay, the first

18:32.440 --> 18:40.440
I have to stop resisting it. But then you stop resisting it, the pain might disappear.

18:40.440 --> 18:45.000
But you don't get fooled by that and then, okay, see, I fixed it, that's the fix. So each

18:45.000 --> 18:49.320
time the pain arises, I'll stop resisting it. And then you develop this general view

18:49.320 --> 18:53.080
that overrides everything. Sometimes it could respond to the nature of things, sometimes

18:53.080 --> 18:58.000
it doesn't. The point is, if it doesn't even once, it means it's not the right view.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.760
Right view is always the right view. So you should not be fooled by when you, yeah, you

19:03.760 --> 19:10.640
just stop resisting it. You just resign to it. The pain is gone. Okay, this particular

19:10.640 --> 19:17.760
pain is gone. Now, how will I reach a point where you want to rise in the first place?

19:17.760 --> 19:24.680
And accepting, see, all of those psychological methods, the heat, you just accept it or

19:24.680 --> 19:30.040
you do this or you do that. All that required thing to rise in the first place, which means

19:30.040 --> 19:33.880
all that requires ignorance and craving in order to be able to deal with ignorance and

19:33.880 --> 19:43.480
craving temporarily. So that's why it's not satisfactory for somebody who wants to be free.

19:43.480 --> 19:48.720
And that's why it doesn't pertain to the nature of the four noble truths. Because four

19:48.720 --> 19:54.080
noble truths are more than just, oh, you just accept or you just don't indulge. That's

19:54.080 --> 20:00.680
anybody can do that and see the degree of worldly benefit in it. No, you have to have a direct

20:00.680 --> 20:07.200
simultaneous insight into presence of craving, to the extent that craving is present, to

20:07.200 --> 20:18.840
that extent suffering is present. Because the only reason accepting in regard to pain

20:18.840 --> 20:29.720
works is because it cancels out the craving. But accepting it, oh no, I'm welcoming it,

20:29.720 --> 20:34.680
that's actually already overdoing it. You don't need to go that far. But because you don't

20:34.680 --> 20:40.680
know, you go that far and as it happens, going that far also passes the craving and cancels

20:40.680 --> 20:47.280
it out. But then you keep walking much further than you have to. In other words, it happens

20:47.280 --> 20:53.560
that accepting also cancels out the craving in regard to the unpleasant feeling. But if

20:53.560 --> 20:57.440
you are to understand that the presence of craving means presence of suffering and you

20:57.440 --> 21:04.880
just abandon craving, then you don't have to accept anything, nor refuse anything. Because

21:04.880 --> 21:17.760
the attitude of accepting and refusing is aimed at the thing out there. You see what I mean?

21:17.760 --> 21:25.040
Like the path that you cross, the distance that you cross in an act of accepting, something

21:25.040 --> 21:31.640
that bothers you, happens to also walk past the degree of craving that is somewhere there.

21:31.640 --> 21:35.440
But you have no idea what that craving is, so you just go the whole distance and then

21:35.440 --> 21:39.440
the craving disappears, sometimes. Not always, obviously.

21:39.440 --> 21:45.760
Because it really might have changed anything. Well, exactly. Or you might have been walking

21:45.760 --> 21:49.880
in a different direction. You might have been thinking accepting the wrong thing and craving

21:49.880 --> 21:53.880
applying to something different. So when you get it right, you get it for the wrong

21:53.880 --> 22:04.080
reasons. In other words, you don't know why you got it right. But if you recognize it,

22:04.080 --> 22:08.560
and then again, again, because of that, accepting people to develop this general plan can view,

22:08.560 --> 22:12.840
so then they just accept everything. I love everyone. And then I pretend that people

22:12.840 --> 22:21.320
are not bad. But if you were to see that actually, it's irrelevant. What happens to you?

22:21.320 --> 22:27.040
It's irrelevant whether you accept it or not. What is relevant, whether you crave or not?

22:27.040 --> 22:35.560
In other words, what I was saying before is, there can be craving, sorry, accepting and

22:35.560 --> 22:41.800
craving, accepting or refusing implies craving. But there can be craving without accepting

22:41.800 --> 22:53.120
or refusing. So you can't accept or refuse as a pathogen without craving. But you can

22:53.120 --> 23:00.000
still crave without accepting or refusing. Because craving is more promoted than act of accepting

23:00.000 --> 23:09.440
in regard to particular thing or refusing the particular thing. So you just know. So you

23:09.440 --> 23:13.600
might do that initially, because your mind is not subtle enough. But the point is to take

23:13.600 --> 23:17.800
you to the point whereby you recognize that the craving is problem, and that's what

23:17.800 --> 23:21.920
a solution is. So abandoning craving then will prevent the problem from arising in the

23:21.920 --> 23:26.800
first place. And then the act of accepting or refusing will not be active or accepting

23:26.800 --> 23:34.200
or refusing through craving. It will just be agreeable, disagreeable. And also, by knowing

23:34.200 --> 23:40.440
where the real problem of craving is, you won't have to pretend and try to cover everything

23:40.440 --> 23:45.960
up and paint in your blanket view. Oh no, no, no, he is a good person. Oh no, he means

23:45.960 --> 23:51.960
well, he means well, no. He acts like a foolish idiot, and it's a fact. But you're not upset

23:51.960 --> 24:00.240
in a car that even if he's insulting you, because you don't crave. Or rather, a recognition

24:00.240 --> 24:07.080
of someone's innocence, stupidity, aimed at you that is offending you, that offense won't

24:07.080 --> 24:14.240
cause you suffering. You can recognize this is disagreeable, but you won't suffer on

24:14.240 --> 24:24.480
that account, because you won't crave in regard to what is disagreeable. And you still

24:24.480 --> 24:31.480
don't have to accept what he's saying. Why would you accept it when you know it's loads

24:31.480 --> 24:35.240
of nonsense? Why would you have to pretend that he's good? So people do that because they

24:35.240 --> 24:43.240
don't know what to do. Same where we spoke about the super, by not recognizing the super

24:43.240 --> 24:49.760
nemitana, super nemitana, and dealing in the level of significance, people need to, they

24:49.760 --> 24:54.040
overshoot the mark and they look at the decomposed bodies and stuff. That helps initially in

24:54.040 --> 25:01.160
the same sense, accepting good health initially. But only so, that you can be able to recognize

25:01.160 --> 25:06.680
it actually, the problem is way beyond this. The problem is that I'm moved in the first

25:06.680 --> 25:12.120
place. So I don't want to have to go and run and look at the pictures of decomposed bodies

25:12.120 --> 25:16.440
whenever I have lost the rising. But it's way too much last when I got careless. Then

25:16.440 --> 25:22.520
it can help snap you back. But the point is no, the mind needs to be established in regard

25:22.520 --> 25:28.840
to beautiful or ugly, as something that is ugly, as something is unwanted. And that's

25:28.840 --> 25:33.920
where dispassion is reached. And then you can have all the beauty in front of you. The

25:33.920 --> 25:38.840
mind is beyond it. The mind sees it as it is. But if you each time keep running back to

25:38.840 --> 25:44.280
the pictures in a super, you have a nice little collection and it will work less and less.

25:44.280 --> 25:48.600
And it's exactly this accepting attitude. I'll just just be present and accept whatever

25:48.600 --> 25:53.080
comes your way. It can come as a revelation to somebody who's never present and never accepted

25:53.080 --> 25:59.240
anything that comes his way. And then to accepting it, he does actually accidentally as well,

25:59.240 --> 26:05.320
doesn't crave. But that's only initially, because he just took the whole box, but sooner or later

26:05.320 --> 26:10.440
that will wear out. And then it will stop having that effect. Because then you start craving in

26:10.440 --> 26:22.920
regard to that, craving doesn't stay always in front of you. So in the same sense as a subo,

26:22.920 --> 26:30.520
it shoots the mind, if done improperly, accepting or refusing, or at a fused pleasure will mean

26:30.520 --> 26:36.440
you deny all the pleasure. Pleasant feeling, you think the pleasant feeling is the problem,

26:36.440 --> 26:43.480
you deny it, you think the painful feeling is the problem, you accept it. But neither painful,

26:43.480 --> 27:08.760
nor pleasant feeling, the neutral, are actually the problem. So you have no craving in regard to

27:08.760 --> 27:15.800
what you feel. If the bad feeling arises on account of what somebody said, you can see it clearly.

27:19.000 --> 27:26.360
Oh, what he said is right, I was actually wrong. So this agreeable feeling is the result of

27:26.360 --> 27:32.120
something wrong that I've done. Like sometimes when other hands are reprimanded by the Buddha.

27:32.120 --> 27:39.560
But because it won't be any craving, you won't take it personally, you can't, it's inconceivable.

27:40.920 --> 27:44.200
So your behavior will just be modified according to it. Oh, this is right.

27:45.880 --> 27:51.000
Or if they just criticize you, and there is a disagreeable feeling on account of the world you're

27:51.000 --> 27:55.240
hearing, and you realize they have no idea what they talk about, they're the losing ignorant

27:55.240 --> 28:01.960
angry person, you will not at all, you thank your brother, thank you, you're here, no, you know. And

28:01.960 --> 28:05.880
that's a fact, and you don't want to be there, so you are the dismissed them, or leave yourself,

28:05.880 --> 28:12.680
you don't have to deal with any of it. It's being crazy. Either way you won't crave, being

28:12.680 --> 28:19.480
praised, pleasure, you won't be taken by. Sometimes praise is a fact, then you can confirm it,

28:19.480 --> 28:24.600
as the Buddha did. Yes, I am the greatest, thank you. But sometimes the praise is for completely

28:24.600 --> 28:28.280
the wrong reasons. And you won't be intoxicated by either of it.

28:40.680 --> 28:50.120
You can find a black now, there's no intense, like I was, intense feelings, or I can't notice any intense.

28:50.120 --> 28:56.040
No, there's an intro feeling, and there's the hardest one to recognize,

28:58.520 --> 29:04.040
craving in the north and there, and as we spoke before, craving in our intellect,

29:04.040 --> 29:11.400
like resting, feeling secure, feeling safe, feeling calm, feeling peaceful,

29:11.400 --> 29:18.520
unless it's the piece of an era, and then it's not the piece.

29:26.760 --> 29:31.160
So you should not relax, you can lay down and sleep, but in turn,

29:31.160 --> 29:35.880
your mind should never relax, because it doesn't need to relax, that's the whole point.

29:35.880 --> 29:41.000
Body needs to relax, body needs to sleep, the mind doesn't. It doesn't at all.

29:46.920 --> 29:52.680
Now I'm really tired, I need to sit down. You sit down, but with your body sitting down,

29:52.680 --> 30:00.360
your mind sits down. But there isn't an excuse for that. That's what the Buddha meant when he said,

30:00.360 --> 30:06.760
the consciousness should not rest and get established upon anything. Like a cow,

30:06.760 --> 30:10.200
if it leans onto the wall, it's eaten by the insides, it leans on the ground,

30:10.200 --> 30:14.040
it leans on the tree, it's eaten by whatever it leans on.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.320
And that doesn't require effort, right? That doesn't require, you're like,

30:21.320 --> 30:28.600
you know, clenching your teeth, I can't do it, not at all. You're just an attitude of mind

30:29.640 --> 30:32.760
in regard to laying in your bed all day.

30:35.320 --> 30:41.160
You just have to have that mind. That attitude requires mindfulness, which is why mindfulness

30:41.160 --> 30:46.280
is always needed. You can have that too much. And mindfulness to the extent that

30:46.280 --> 30:53.000
the consciousness is the biggest. Yeah, the existence, exactly. Mental drilling,

30:53.000 --> 30:59.400
making that mental effort. It doesn't cover your body. Sometimes you have to get up,

30:59.400 --> 31:05.000
keep walking, don't just go to sleep again, because often people give in to sleep as a form of

31:05.960 --> 31:12.280
mind goes to sleep. If you go to sleep only when your body really leads to sleep, that's fine.

31:12.280 --> 31:17.240
But if you go to sleep as a psychological result of, you know, you don't want to deal with stuff

31:17.240 --> 31:23.800
for, the mind is resting. So I like to come back from work, open a can of beer, and you know,

31:23.800 --> 31:31.000
watch my favorite TV program. I deserve it. I've been working eight hours a day, I need to rest.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.880
That's obviously the coolest example. But you can, you know, leave an equity without a TV without

31:35.880 --> 31:43.560
anything. And yeah, I've been meditating for 10 hours, and I'm going to go and sit down and

31:43.560 --> 31:51.160
have a cup of tea and rest. Sure, do that. But that's still not an excuse for your mind to sit down

31:51.160 --> 31:58.440
and rest. No, it's an excuse that when you're busy for your mind to go and get busy.

31:58.440 --> 32:06.120
I think to see the distinction, this is my body, and we'll do what it has to do, what it needs to do.

32:06.120 --> 32:14.040
And keep your mind alert in regard to it. That's what mindfulness is about the means basically.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
This means you're like a robot touching means basically you're mindful in a way of whatever

32:19.000 --> 32:24.520
your body is doing throughout the day and night. Action's intention and stuff, you're mindful

32:24.520 --> 32:30.280
in regard to it. So you don't lay in it, you don't come into it, you don't become it.

32:35.320 --> 32:41.720
Yeah, that was a good, a good night, some good days. You can't play it, can't play it. And then

32:43.320 --> 32:49.880
when you're laying down. Yeah, you can give up. Stop pounding letting that. You'll be working all day.

32:49.880 --> 32:55.720
I will continue. Well, whatever if the continues are not, that's fine. That's on its own.

32:56.600 --> 33:01.080
But the only thing you should be concerned when you're okay, I've been making effort all day,

33:01.080 --> 33:07.400
I can't do it anymore. That's fine. Go ahead and have a break. Physically and mentally,

33:07.400 --> 33:12.360
so to speak, but don't allow your mind to rest in that rest.

33:12.360 --> 33:22.680
Yeah, always keep an eye on it, because that doesn't require a terrible zero effort, because the

33:22.680 --> 33:28.920
eye, the awareness, the degree of awareness is always there. Always you be dead. So that's why

33:28.920 --> 33:35.640
mindfulness comes with understanding of what mindfulness is. The awareness is always there.

33:35.640 --> 33:42.280
That's why awareness is always there. No, a degree of awareness is always there for as long as

33:42.280 --> 33:51.320
you're alive. That's how it gets work. So it just means that whatever it's arising,

33:51.320 --> 33:55.240
there is a degree of awareness in regard to it. Otherwise, that thing would not be manifested.

33:55.880 --> 34:00.600
So you stop doing the awareness, I'm aware, I'm mindful. You just recognize it as coming,

34:00.600 --> 34:06.520
being implied in the things. So the mind never forgets that, and in that way, you never lose

34:06.520 --> 34:12.440
mindfulness even in the act of forgetting. You forget something particularly, you don't forget

34:12.440 --> 34:29.640
the nature of forgetting. And that resting, that welcoming, is delighting. That's what the

34:29.640 --> 34:35.320
life is here. That's always, it doesn't delight, it doesn't welcome. That's what I have to do.

34:37.720 --> 34:42.040
You've been sleeping all day and wake up and you still feel a crap and you can't get up.

34:43.000 --> 34:51.480
You're just physically wiped. So you go back to sleep. That's fine. As long as you don't welcome

34:51.480 --> 34:58.360
it internally. Don't welcome anything internally. That doesn't mean you have to stop doing it externally.

35:00.440 --> 35:08.840
So there is a distinction. So you don't welcome it. And through that non-welcoming,

35:09.640 --> 35:15.480
if it was generally bodily tiredness, yeah, you'll sleep. But if it ain't, it would become apparent.

35:15.480 --> 35:20.360
I don't know, I'm not actually sleeping anymore, which means it wasn't bodily. It was something my mind

35:20.360 --> 35:27.400
wanted to do because there was no other distractions to keep me up engaged. So I just couldn't deal with

35:27.400 --> 35:34.440
boredom. But then when you're bored, fine, we're bored. Don't do anything. Don't welcome that.

35:36.120 --> 35:41.400
You can keep not doing anything. Never welcoming for a second, or you can keep doing it, but

35:41.400 --> 35:47.160
oh, I want to let our want to go for a nice place and walk climb the waterfalls. It's fine. Don't

35:47.160 --> 35:50.600
welcome it. Don't welcome it in the beginning. Don't welcome it at the end. Don't welcome it for

35:50.600 --> 35:57.880
the only time in between. So the mind always remains alert in regard to it. And that's effortless.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.280
Does it require any of it? In the beginning, obviously, it would feel like, you know,

36:02.280 --> 36:12.280
I'm spoiling the party, but it's just because you're over-shooting the mark, initially, so you're all uptight.

36:12.280 --> 36:39.000
Well, don't welcome that. It's a great one for being, when knowing being, it's just that. That's the feeling.

36:39.000 --> 36:48.120
Well, yeah, craving for being, craving for non-being, craving for sensuality. Basically,

36:48.120 --> 36:53.800
craving for sensuality is craving for being, or non-being through the senses. So it's even more

36:53.800 --> 37:01.960
proliferated. For particular thing, craving for particularness of particular that means

37:01.960 --> 37:07.480
sensual craving. Now you can stop craving in regard to particular object, particular objects of

37:07.480 --> 37:12.280
your senses, and then you abandon the central craving. But then you still have the more subtle

37:12.280 --> 37:20.200
craving for being and the absence of being, non-being, craving for A phenomenon to be or A phenomenon

37:20.200 --> 37:26.280
to disappear. So it's still subtle kind of affinity and resistance.

37:28.280 --> 37:34.120
Obviously, much subtler than actually fully developed craving for central objects, or

37:34.120 --> 37:39.720
absence of them, if they are unpleasant. But it's still the same age, so that's why Anagami is

37:39.720 --> 37:49.880
not free from those regards to craving. You can't love and hate, which pertains to the

37:51.720 --> 37:59.560
infatuation or revulsion in regard to central objects. But you can still experience

37:59.560 --> 38:07.560
craving in regard to phenomena and absence. It doesn't mean craving for the whole

38:07.560 --> 38:15.880
he delights in the dharma. No, no, no. Badia was affected by that woman laughing at him.

38:17.080 --> 38:23.640
Didn't hate her, because he was affected by it. He craving for non-being or that experience,

38:23.640 --> 38:29.400
which is what sent him out, and made him realize.

38:35.800 --> 38:40.040
And say, like when Anagami's don't lay Anagami, they don't become because

38:40.680 --> 38:49.160
or be coonies and go forth, is when they still, well, they crave for the notion of the sense of

38:49.160 --> 38:55.960
duty in regard to their family. No, that's the right thing, that's what I want to do.

38:55.960 --> 39:01.080
So they stay to look after their parents, and that's why they don't become adults. But they're

39:01.080 --> 39:28.520
bad to sexuality and everything. So I forgot, in the day, making craving myself, well, I mean,

39:28.520 --> 39:32.200
there's back in the morning watching for that. Well, you can't see your craving directly.

39:33.240 --> 39:40.280
It's not like, oh, there's Anagami, stop doing it. What you have to watch in the back of your mind

39:40.280 --> 39:52.280
is whether you delight in acceptance or delight in aversion. That's what Anger offers a form of pleasure.

39:52.280 --> 40:02.840
He says on me, and you feel angry, and then you delight in telling them all for, or, you know,

40:02.840 --> 40:08.360
revenge, payback, or ranting about them to somebody else's gige for relief.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.840
Yeah, yeah, he's like a sifla guy, he's like a guy, you're delighting in that.

40:12.840 --> 40:22.040
So in order to not crave, well, you can offer sure that there is a suffering present craving is there.

40:23.800 --> 40:29.480
So how can you indirectly, directly do it? If you know what I mean, it's an

40:29.480 --> 40:34.840
indirect action, but if it's fully known how it can be done, it can be done directly, in its indirect nature.

40:34.840 --> 40:43.640
Yeah. Yeah. Watching the light. Well, you watch the light. That's something you do.

40:43.640 --> 40:50.040
Oh, I'm welcoming it, therefore I will not welcome it. Through that welcome it, you cannot crave it.

40:50.040 --> 40:57.480
Through that craving, the suffering won't be there. But then you also need to recognize that,

40:57.480 --> 41:03.880
because the degree of this pleasure will still be there, but that's not what suffering is.

41:03.880 --> 41:11.080
So that's why the understanding is like the core of the whole thing and the reason for liberation.

41:11.080 --> 41:20.120
Somebody can do this, but without understanding, without being able to discern what he's told to

41:20.120 --> 41:28.200
discern, I discern the pain, I reason on its own, from the suffering. Unless you discern that,

41:28.200 --> 41:33.800
it is the same thing, basically like two sheets of glass identical, unless you know that they're two,

41:33.800 --> 41:40.760
you won't know that they're two, because it's just one thing. And there is no difference between the two,

41:42.200 --> 41:45.560
but except that they're two, and that's the difference.

41:49.640 --> 41:57.000
Too much suffering in pain. Yeah. Physical pain. Well, like see that when you say physical pain,

41:57.000 --> 42:02.680
people usually associate a bodily sensation, or that's unpleasant. No, that's not physical pain.

42:04.360 --> 42:09.960
Hearing somebody shouting abuse of you is a physical pain, because it came through your physical

42:09.960 --> 42:18.600
ears. Seeing a disgusting image is a physical pain. Or it's pain or isn't regard to what,

42:18.600 --> 42:29.880
yeah, having a lunch chopped off is also physical pain. Now mental pain isn't regard to any of that

42:29.880 --> 42:48.360
type of pain. When your mind is affected by it as well. Well, there is a feeling of am I bothered

42:48.360 --> 42:56.280
on account of feeling unpleasant? Do I feel an urge to deal with it? Means, oh, I'm craving.

42:56.280 --> 43:01.160
There is a craving present, and that's the reason why I suffer. And that's the problem. Not

43:01.160 --> 43:07.080
the unpleasant feeling, it has a reason. That's why when it says, it's like he develops three, four

43:07.080 --> 43:13.880
knowledge and becomes an art hand, and he recognizes any disturbance that is left with me now,

43:13.880 --> 43:19.160
will be disturbance in a kind of this far sense, or on kind of this body. And that's often said,

43:19.160 --> 43:27.000
oh, just endure unpleasant words and abuse or ever done. Just endure it brown when you're done.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
He said that, why would the woman need to say that to Uncle Himal? I mean, he was already in

43:31.000 --> 43:35.960
our hand. That's what you would think, wouldn't you? No, you're just reminding him,

43:35.960 --> 43:40.280
because there is, there would be still this pleasure, but none of it can ever even

43:40.280 --> 43:49.960
be remotely conceived, pain like suffering, which is what pain is. This agreeable feeling is not

43:49.960 --> 43:54.200
pain. Not wanting this agreeable feeling, that's what pain is.

43:56.920 --> 44:04.360
Yes, you could overshoot, let's say, by feeling a cramp in your leg, me, it's not too twisted.

44:04.360 --> 44:10.840
Yeah, I'll endure it, I'll endure it, okay. That's already misplacing, you're thinking it's

44:10.840 --> 44:19.560
out there, so do you know? What you should do then, you should move, and then recognize the pain

44:19.560 --> 44:24.840
of the guilt, then arises an account that you couldn't hold up your determination to not move.

44:25.480 --> 44:30.520
That's what suffering is more likely to be found, than enduring in your twisted joint,

44:30.520 --> 44:34.440
and then turning yourself into an invalid, because you're such a keen meditator.

44:39.240 --> 44:44.040
The anxiety, the hollow feeling that arises on the fact that you could not hold up

44:45.960 --> 44:51.480
the determination that has a reason I will not move, I moved. Oh, what is that showing?

44:51.480 --> 44:55.640
You were not in control. That's very unpleasant, that's what suffering is.

44:55.640 --> 45:03.800
So let that arise, don't bother torturing your body, and twisting your knees, and

45:05.720 --> 45:08.120
pushing the nails through your skin, or whatever else they do.

45:09.560 --> 45:16.360
No, let the guilt, let the anxiety, let those painful mental feelings arise, because they all

45:16.360 --> 45:21.320
have in common suffering, there's no doubt about them. You can suffer in regard to the body,

45:21.320 --> 45:25.960
what you heard, but when it comes to this type of suffering, that is always suffering,

45:25.960 --> 45:31.320
which is why those things cannot arise in the naran. This agreeable feeling can arise on the

45:31.320 --> 45:36.840
account of somebody shouting abuse at him. A agreeable feeling might arise on the account of

45:36.840 --> 45:44.040
somebody praising him. None of those things will induce lust or aversion anymore ever again,

45:44.040 --> 45:51.640
and certainly he'll never have experienced anxiety, guilt, doubt, and all those mental painful

45:51.640 --> 45:57.080
feelings. So there is that difference between mental and bodily, basically just means

45:57.080 --> 46:04.120
on what account has in a reason, but every feeling is a mental feeling. You don't feel feelings in

46:04.120 --> 46:09.720
your body. Oh, I feel something in my back, no, you perceive something in the back, you feel in

46:09.720 --> 46:16.200
regard to your whole body, or particular aspect of your body. Oh, I'm about to lose my hand.

46:16.200 --> 46:19.640
I feel very scared now, and I'm very, very afraid.

46:23.720 --> 46:29.400
And that's what hurts, not the perception of whatever is happening in your hand.

46:29.400 --> 46:43.320
And when I get in that, I couldn't feel any physical pain, but it's painful.

46:43.320 --> 46:54.840
Yeah, you've got that. The body is, you know, pressure, you just keep moving here and there.

46:54.840 --> 47:02.520
You know, it's leaning back, so you know, it's scratching, and that's annoying. That's the problem.

47:03.800 --> 47:05.720
So I try not to scratch or just try.

47:05.720 --> 47:17.480
So you might initially not want to scratch, just because, oh, you're not sure where to look for the craving,

47:20.280 --> 47:25.320
or where the problem is. Where the problem is not the need, the problem is not the

47:26.920 --> 47:33.160
arising of ditch and the scratch. The problem is whether you imply cravings for doing it,

47:33.160 --> 47:40.360
whether action constantly implies craving, in which case it's an action, it's a karma.

47:41.240 --> 47:45.000
You remove craving from action, then karma ceases to become, then it just

47:45.000 --> 48:04.600
responds to things, significance, intentions, that's it. You have to be careful in doing things like

48:04.600 --> 48:08.040
you should put up with it, and you think you can't stop there.

48:08.040 --> 48:12.760
But you haven't, does that mean if you can't be on it?

48:13.480 --> 48:18.040
On the server, you know, because something else comes from it. No, that's why, like, in the

48:18.040 --> 48:24.520
service, some, some, some monks, you know, needed ascetic practices, because they would be making them

48:24.520 --> 48:30.760
genuinely look at the right direction, in the right way. Some didn't. Some actually was completely

48:30.760 --> 48:36.680
counterproductive. Through ascetic practices, for them, they were overshooting them up, and they

48:36.680 --> 48:51.000
could not see it. Which is why applying the blanket, we should all be doing this, we should all be

48:51.000 --> 49:09.000
doing as ridiculous. I mean, big to happen, or do something really dramatic, to see, okay, I understand, create, I suppose,

49:09.000 --> 49:15.720
naturally things will happen, and are quite dramatic, so it's quite intense, we use them, or whatever.

49:15.720 --> 49:21.640
Or even if that doesn't happen, the faith that it can happen, if you dwell on it, they will become

49:21.640 --> 49:27.720
dramatic in itself. But that's how people lose their minds. They don't lose their minds when

49:27.720 --> 49:34.760
painful things happen to them directly. They lose their minds when they start gradually,

49:35.480 --> 49:42.120
when they get eroded, by the recognition of the possibility that they are completely exposed,

49:42.120 --> 49:46.440
and again in time, and again in a second, absolutely anything. It freaks you out.

49:47.160 --> 49:51.240
When something bad happens, it's right in front of you, it's painful, or whatever, but it happened.

49:52.520 --> 49:58.760
But the red is substitution. Yeah, exactly, anticipation. Which is what it's meant in the soot

49:58.760 --> 50:07.320
as being prey to suffering. So you don't actually suffer, or you don't have to suffer, but you recognize

50:07.320 --> 50:14.440
that you are prey to suffering, like descending upon you, so to speak, for whatever reasons.

50:14.440 --> 50:20.120
You imagine, how would you feel if you were a prey? There isn't a problem in front of you,

50:20.120 --> 50:28.360
but you just feel like at any time, something can pass on you, and hunt you down, and get you like that.

50:29.240 --> 50:33.960
So even if nothing does, the fact that this, that's what brings you, makes you mad.

50:33.960 --> 50:41.560
The anticipation in the war, like when people are in war, that's when you know, they go gray,

50:41.560 --> 50:52.440
and lose their, you know, age 50 years overnight, because they're weight of my diet.

50:54.840 --> 50:59.720
It's much easier when the fight breaks, start, oh, it's right there in front, so you just

50:59.720 --> 51:06.440
fight or not, but it's the anticipation of the fight. Let's say it's the same age, anticipation

51:06.440 --> 51:14.440
of the suffering. He feels his prey to suffering. That's the scary, not the fact that you suffer.

51:14.440 --> 51:19.560
Well, that's also painful, but the fact that you can't suffer again, and again, and again, and again,

51:19.560 --> 51:29.240
and you will. So if there is, imagine, if there is, if you are a prey,

51:29.240 --> 51:33.400
to something, if something is hunting you, constantly.

51:36.440 --> 51:41.480
You always just think that the results will come when actually, well, it's there as well.

51:42.360 --> 51:45.480
I do, I do try to bring it up there. Well, you have to come to brain death.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.480
The possibility of the timing. Exactly.

51:51.480 --> 51:55.960
Because you might try to bring it up in particular things, and might bring it up to an extent,

51:55.960 --> 52:02.200
in regard to particular things, but you kind of leave yourself out of it through that,

52:02.200 --> 52:07.880
that sort of incomplete contemplation. But if you start thinking about the fact that you die,

52:09.480 --> 52:19.640
stop reading, drown. It's risky because it can really freak you out, but yeah, it does hammer it

52:19.640 --> 52:32.920
back home. If you fear death, there is a feeling in regard to something like there is something

52:32.920 --> 52:39.000
you are still holding, and to that degree you are alive. That gives you the, well,

52:39.000 --> 52:48.520
it comes home. Motivation and it's sort of like delineates, delineates, that's what delineates, outlines

52:48.520 --> 53:01.080
the problem, it reminds you of where the problem is. And that's, you know, that's what dumb is,

53:01.080 --> 53:10.760
that's what dumb is. And you deal with that problem, you overcome death, fear of death, no particular

53:10.760 --> 53:14.440
problem arising on the account of particular instance, you know, we can never bother you.

53:14.440 --> 53:27.240
He's just going to be disagreeable with you, aren't they? Yeah, you left it all.

53:33.640 --> 53:38.680
Because it kind of plays my dying, you know, I get pretty much like, and then I can process

53:38.680 --> 53:47.880
all the same, you know, I sort of imagine it. Well, again, if you imagine it linearly in a process,

53:47.880 --> 53:54.840
then it's not really a calica. Obviously, it can always be a calica, in a sense that any

53:54.840 --> 54:00.280
linear process is present as such, as an elicent thing, and mindful of death means ah,

54:01.080 --> 54:07.000
right there right now, so that is a calica. So no matter what stage of your linear contemplation

54:07.000 --> 54:12.600
of death, you recognize, I will die. That's simultaneous.

54:25.560 --> 54:28.040
Because you're not doing the contemplation so to actually die,

54:29.080 --> 54:33.080
but doing the contemplation to allow that fear of death to arise,

54:33.080 --> 54:38.280
and see on what level of your eyes is, and this is what needs to be dealt.

54:39.400 --> 54:44.440
Because even that fear, if it's unpleasant, it's not a pleasant because of the dying,

54:44.440 --> 54:48.600
and because of the fear, it's a pleasant because you crave, and you go, you so don't want it.

54:50.120 --> 54:55.640
So you remove that, not wanting it. You don't welcome the unwanting.

54:55.640 --> 55:05.640
And then you won't be afraid of death either. The only thing you would be, he's very

55:05.640 --> 55:12.920
mindful, if the death comes. Or just the thought that will immediately bring the mindful,

55:12.920 --> 55:16.600
because that's where mindfulness comes from, which is why, like Sartre Pan has been

55:16.600 --> 55:28.680
managing throughout life, the moment of that, he will realize the fruit, because that's where the fruit is.

55:30.200 --> 55:36.760
But I try to get just death, you know, because I know, but I do know that

55:36.760 --> 55:41.320
is a possibility. I leave the situation, I get caught up in other situations,

55:41.320 --> 55:46.840
and I go out, sit here, whatever that I caught up is interesting. I can't look at caught up.

55:46.840 --> 55:55.080
I pick up a fire and I can feel a pool, or whatever that. So some of that I don't see with craving,

55:56.120 --> 56:02.840
but I see the craving for criticism. Well, that's why you have to have that wisdom to recognise

56:02.840 --> 56:10.440
off. The problem is still there. So whether I'm now using this environment to avoid the recognition,

56:11.400 --> 56:15.560
and remind us that the problem is still there, or whether I'm using it to really practice.

56:16.520 --> 56:22.200
And again, it's like how you eat your food, and why you eat your food. But you allow it to become

56:22.200 --> 56:36.040
because it's natural, or where you keep in mind the real reasons.
