1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,360
what is the escape from pain most people think it's hot most people think it is

2
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,000
pleasure pleasure the escape from pain well they don't necessarily think that

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,840
I think that's the only escape that I know so the only attitude that a person

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,600
without a right view will have only one attitude towards pain which is

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,840
covered in pleasure that's the only means of escape that I know either to

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,280
try to get rid of the pain because that's more pleasant or to actually finding

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,400
some different pleasure to occupy yourself with so you forget about the

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,120
pain either way you turn towards pleasure in order to avoid pain because you can't

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,160
deal with pain on its own terms so and that that's what the what the sort to

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,000
say they put to dinner doesn't know any other escape from pain other than

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,480
sensuality essential pleasure that's what I've seen before like the the people

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,480
another tractor to sensuality just because it's pleasant and gives you that you

13
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,520
know sweet taste or something they're also dependent on it because that the

14
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,040
only means that their mind has dealing with pain so the prospect of sensuality

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,800
it's already something people depend on the possibility of getting placed exactly

16
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,000
at least at least pleasure is is perpetually possible I might be refraining from it

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,200
not engaging with sensuality but I'm still using the possibility of pleasure as a

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,960
relief from when the pain is there so you still depend on the pleasure I can

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,280
deal with this pain now because there is a possibility there is a there is a

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,760
promise a prospect of pleasure later on they will be great and so it's worth

21
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,680
enduring this pain now and that's fine everybody like even when you want

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,600
hard-hunching to be free from suffering you still have the projected idea of

23
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,480
pleasure through it but the the whole practice revolves around actually not

24
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:31,040
removing your dependence on sensual pleasure as a mean of dealing with pain

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,640
so removing your dependence even on the possibility of sensual pleasure as means

26
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,920
of dealing with pain that's why when people had heard the Buddha described

27
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,160
Nibbana to them the pathogenes in the suttas they were well they were scared

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,360
because in their minds it was like oh that's basically complete absence of joy

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,120
pleasure the only form of joy and pleasure they're the nanolite of my

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,680
nose which is central pleasure so in their minds all this was like this is the

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,120
most depressing miserable dreadful thing they will kill me and destroy me if

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,240
that's they were they were generally generally shocked afraid by it

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:19,120
good anxiety of fear because mind that depends on pleasure absence of pleasure

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,960
means misery but it doesn't absence of pleasure does not mean pain just means

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,720
absence of pleasure absence of pain as well so basically what those people were

36
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,760
afraid of was just a pure neutral feeling neither pleasant nor unpleasant but the

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,200
mind that depends on pleasure neither pleasant means painful doesn't matter

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,240
that it's not unpleasant either the fact that it's not pleasant for the mind

39
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,280
that depends on pleasure is terrifying but it's terrifying not because in

40
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,600
itself it's terrifying it's terrifying because you're refusing to give up your

41
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,200
dependence on pleasure not of fear but that fear feeds your dependence which

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
then makes you afraid which and feeds the defense it's a vicious circle

43
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:17,600
centrality or pardana or centrality so this neutral feeling because of your

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,880
craving for pleasure it's it's just exactly and that's what the suttas say

45
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,320
when neutral feeling is not known not understood not discerned it will be

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,040
felt unpleasantly so that's what meant like you you you nibana is the absence

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,880
of joy it's joyless but joylessness does not mean misery

48
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,880
joylessness means equanimity joylessness means no joy and no pain means peace

49
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,440
means evenness but in order to value that the mind needs to train to that

50
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,960
level needs to train for it so in other words you need to discern and

51
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,120
develop wisdom in regard to the neutral feeling and then it will become the

52
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,360
supreme peace of nibana nothing can match that peace but in mind it depends on

53
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,640
pleasure depends on prospect and uses at least the possibility of future

54
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,640
pleasure as a means of relief in regard to the day-to-day pain when that mind

55
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,440
here joylessness that is automatically felt as misery absolute depressing

56
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,800
overwhelming pain it's not pleasant but it's not unpleasant either but you

57
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
don't get to value the fact that it's not unpleasant either because you're too

58
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,660
concerned about oh there is no joy so that's the sensory strength needs to be

59
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,000
done before if you have true sensory strength you basically start training

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,600
yourself towards joylessness of sensuality and then again the root of

61
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,720
sensuality as the Buddha said so many times is your delight in the joy that

62
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,080
you get on account it's not the beautiful or tasty objects in the world the root

63
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,680
of sensuality is your dependence on that type of pleasure nothing else remove

64
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,240
that dependence on that pleasure and you will find peace so sensory strain is

65
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,480
physically preparing you withdrawing you from that pleasure so then mentally you

66
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,440
can see how gratuitously you depend on it and then choose to withdraw yourself

67
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,540
because oh this is not worth clinging to as the suttas would say but if you're not

68
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,320
physically withdrawn you will never mentally be able to like stop depending

69
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:38,280
on it so sensory strength means basically emulating nibana pretty much

70
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,960
emulating the non-dependence on on joy that's that's acquired through

71
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,640
senses but you need to start doing it even if you still want to do have it

72
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,120
mentally physically at least you need to be drawn verbally you need to be withdrawn

73
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,640
and then eventually mentally you'll be able to do so as well but yeah once you

74
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,440
start withdrawing yourself on that engaging in pleasures then what will

75
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,680
naturally occur is that experience of mutual freedom well exactly once you

76
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,040
start withdrawing yourself physically from pleasures that's already training

77
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,960
for you to be able to endure the neutral feeling and not freak out in

78
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,120
regard to it so only people that are not withdrawn bodily verbally mentally from

79
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,360
sensuality lose their mind when they recognize what nibana is or that will

80
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,520
kill me that will destroy me if you already have been cultivating sensory

81
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,880
strength say not yourself taming your senses practicing sense control it's not

82
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,640
gonna be as frightening the joylessness of nibana will be something you can

83
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,600
actually get closer to as opposed to lose your mind fall on the ground pull

84
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,440
your hair be the breasts in despair like oh that will kill me as they did when

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,240
the Buddha would clearly show what nibana what he's teaching is now that's

86
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,160
what's always said like like those who are free from passion they have no like

87
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,080
fear even in face of death because that's what that is cessation of these

88
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,560
senses upon which what upon which pleasures I depend but those who are

89
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,800
free from passion even when these senses are threatened there is no fear

90
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,480
because there's no passion I there's no dependence on the pleasure of the

91
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,620
senses so the absence of passion means no fear of death means no fear of

92
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,480
nibana means no fear of dispassion doesn't mean speech depression doesn't

93
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,320
mean exactly depression it's only generated from the point of view you

94
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,440
still depends on the pleasure and now you found something that fully like a

95
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,280
crashes that dependence removes it and there is no more future of it and that

96
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,080
is scary because you refuse to give it up or because neutral feeling in itself

97
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:58,600
is scary so it's joyless but it's also there is but that though that doesn't

98
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,160
mean it's miserable so absence of joy and absence of misery that's the absence of

99
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,520
ambitious and like a thirsty inspiration for achievement and absence of depression

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,360
as the other hand in the suit that would say in the terra terra terra terra

101
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,400
gata I delight not in life is actually no delight towards anything in this life

102
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:28,880
through the senses and I delight not in death right I await my time and that's

103
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,920
the other hand declaration there's no delight and a description of the

104
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,080
fourth John and that's the perfect complete surmounting your equanimity you

105
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,680
know oopak a sati is but it's just a mounting of that pleasure and pain and

106
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,160
joy and grief and the spirit of that pleasure and pain so it's it's

107
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,720
completely steadied mind in a neutral feeling and that's the whole point and

108
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,920
that's what the jana is even the first jana it's it's already from the point of

109
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,240
view of non-jana first jana it's like steadying your mind in the neutral feeling

110
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,960
neutral from that point of view obviously you can go even further and and

111
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,280
refine that neutral feeling up to the point of full jana equanimity but even

112
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,360
the first jana starts by abandoning joy and grief in regard to the world and

113
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,320
unification of the mind that comes on a kind of thinking and pondering and so on

114
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,640
and that in itself it's felt pleasantly in a sense of a neutral peace neutral

115
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,040
feeling when understood it's felt pleasantly that's what the truth is

116
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,880
saying neutral feeling when not understood it is felt unpleasantly to

117
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,280
the understanding your knowledge your discernment of it determines how you're

118
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,600
gonna feel it so joylessness when understood it's pleasant because there's

119
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,800
no disturbance joylessness when not understood it's miserable dreadful

120
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,440
anxious overwhelming so how do you prepare yourself to endure it that which

121
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,120
is overwhelmingly anxious and so on by starting the sensory strength by seeing

122
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,000
the danger in the slightest fault by being watchful mindful careful you're

123
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,200
already practicing strength to be able to endure the neutral feeling which is

124
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,320
initially gonna try to scare you and then you train yourself to that and this

125
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,000
passion is being developed again it comes back to also the other pride

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,320
talk with it or non-activity non-engagement fear of boredom that people

127
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,760
have fear of nothing to do so whether they practice Buddhism or not maybe

128
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,400
everything just becomes another thing I do to keep myself occupied because

129
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,960
otherwise I get overwhelmed by the neutrality I mean boredom is truly just

130
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,520
neutral yet it's the more dreadful thing for every mind that's not developed

131
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,800
so there's more understanding you again the more pleasure will become that

132
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,720
neutral feeling that absence of joy

133
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,400
it's not that you know Aravan's feelings is some like mystical dimension

134
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,720
no it's just three types of feelings whether you're protrusion or an

135
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,120
Aravan is just how much influence those three types of feeling have over you and

136
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,800
your decisions and your views and your assumptions or whether you are free

137
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
from views and assumptions in regards to these feelings and then in the felt

138
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,640
there's just the felt and the same is just the scene her just the same principle

139
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,400
so the feeling that's felt your neutral in regard to it

140
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,480
there's no pressure so there's no pressure means truly there's really no

141
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,640
feeling there in that sense theogenous feeling are gone in an Aravan but it

142
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,480
doesn't mean that Aravan has no aggregate of feeling and so how can Aravan feel

143
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,640
without feeling seeming contradiction well develop understanding of a neutral

144
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,920
feeling and you see and that's the same like when Sariputta declared oh what a

145
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,200
pleasure what a pleasure and the dying I think in the suit is asking would you

146
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,400
what's pleasure says Nibana it's it's pleasure it's like but didn't you on

147
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,360
another occasion say Nibana there is nothing felt and he says yes and that's

148
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,640
what is pleasant the fact there's nothing felt it's it's pleasant so the

149
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:21,000
understanding of there's no feeling here it's very agreeable and it's it all boils

150
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,520
down to development in regard to the neutral feeling obviously in order to

151
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,240
begin even any development in regard to neutral feeling and being able to do

152
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,920
it and withstand it you need to stop habitually giving into the pleasant

153
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,160
feeling and feeding the thirst for more pleasure and you have to habitually stop

154
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,040
giving in to the feeling of the unpleasant feeling to try to get rid of

155
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,440
it resisting it you are by doing these two things you are equipping yourself to

156
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,000
endure neutrality that's felt neither pleasantly but not unpleasant the

157
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,640
either clarifying it exactly by by enduring it you as I said you're becoming

158
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,320
more familiar with it so non-activity enduring the initial anxiety of boredom

159
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,040
and finding value and even that's what we would say like the solitude is for

160
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,440
somebody who is developed wisdom to start finding pleasure in solitude otherwise

161
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,800
you won't otherwise it's terrifying without a wisdom solitude mind cannot

162
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,800
bear it and again the Buddha did outline what you need to prepare beforehand so

163
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,760
that you can benefit from solitude which is impeccable virtue seeing the danger

164
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,800
in the slightest fault says sure Janas but you know they've usually come with

165
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,240
solitude since restraint right view all these things you develop beforehand and

166
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,240
then if you go to forest remote dwellings when there's only wild

167
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,000
animals living and so on you your mind will not overwhelm you you will be

168
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,640
benefiting from the neutrality of it well if you're in a position where there's

169
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,480
nothing to do basically do you don't need to be top of the forest it often yeah

170
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,360
top like a remote forest empty or an empty hut empty of activity empty of

171
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,440
activity empty of distraction empty of others turning way as they please so

172
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,840
physically removed but yes apartment will do just fine you do want to have the

173
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,440
environment that will support that but again don't think that that will do the

174
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,880
work for you you will be ready for the solitude if you've already practiced

175
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,320
census strain in regard to the world if you have all already endured joys and

176
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,840
griefs in regard to the world without acting out of it habitually that's how

177
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,600
you surmounting not by running into a solitude or hiding in the forest

178
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,060
because sometimes there are people trying to contrast this yes see the

179
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,580
word I say we should go to the remote dwellings and so on because they don't

180
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,600
deal with their own sensory strength and stuff here now that's like the second

181
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,240
group of herd deer herd from that sutter that we did also recently that

182
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,520
shines the bait and runs on top of mountain yeah but there's no wisdom

183
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,840
developed it so sensory straight in regard to the world in regard to the

184
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,560
central poles in regard to dependence on the drawers and so on needs to be

185
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,400
developed and needs to be endured it's gonna be painful because not because of

186
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,840
the sensory strain but because of your dependence on joys of centrality that's

187
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,920
why you suffer when you first restrain yourself you don't suffer because you

188
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,240
say no to yourself you suffer because you've been saying yes to yeah you've

189
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,320
been saying yes all this time so saying no to yourself just reveals your

190
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,480
addiction your dependence on these gratuitous central joys that you are

191
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,480
responsible that you're fully feeding and maintaining yeah adding to proliferate

192
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,040
so practice towards joylessness

193
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,440
when joylessness is understood it's the utmost peace of gribbility it's nibana

194
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:10,200
no joy no means joylessness means no delight and it also means no misery and

195
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,520
being unable to be miserable or scared or affected by any type of pain on a

196
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,200
kind of anything including impending death dying you know terminal diagnosis or

197
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,760
whatever else which eventually will have to occur no more prospect of pleasure

198
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,400
well things that are being will be destroyed by death and not things you

199
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,480
depend on anymore why because you removed your dependence on gratuitous joy that

200
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,880
came out of that you removed your delight so joylessness that will die

201
00:17:41,880 --> 00:18:09,720
before you die become joyless and you will be unable to be miserable as well
