1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,280
So can you describe the four Noble Truths and the Buddha's teachers, suffering is the

2
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,200
first number, because there is suffering. Second, there is the cause of suffering. Third,

3
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,680
cessation of suffering and fourth, and path, the cessation of suffering.

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:50,400
Well, first and foremost, there are four descriptions or four aspects of one insight.

5
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,120
That insight being freed from suffering, basically. A few free from suffering,

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,800
then already implies the knowledge of what suffering is, that already implies the knowledge of

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,600
what has been causing that suffering, that already implies the knowledge of freedom of suffering,

8
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
and that already implies knowledge how to maintain that freedom from suffering, that insight.

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,360
Well, how to develop it? Well, okay, yeah, how to maintain, which we basically then result in a

10
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,720
complete liberation from all the upperclass and all the other kind of solutions.

11
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,400
So it's not like one, two, three, four, that a person needs to discern one by one.

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
It's basically suffering and freedom from it.

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,480
And that's what, you know, in many sources, it's mentioned basically, it would be only,

14
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,840
it would only be talked about, about the cause of suffering. And cause of suffering is,

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,200
nothing else except craving. And that's, again, that's something that

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,920
the people might read over, and then maybe you just like seem like it's, oh, it's making sense

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,520
of course, but actually, in terms of the direct insight, seeing the craving is suffering

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,160
results in liberation from that suffering. Seeing the craving means abandoning the craving.

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,240
The only reason you crave is because you don't really see it directly, you don't understand it,

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:30,880
you haven't discern it. And, yeah, the burden, I suppose, is to recognize that whenever

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,920
there is suffering present, you can then say, you can reduce correctly that the craving must

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,880
be present because the suffering is there. So it's not, oh, I suffer, now I have to look for the

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,640
reason, call it craving or something else, or also assuming that sometimes something else can

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,000
be the cause of your suffering. Really needs to be brought on so narrowly and so precisely,

25
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,240
whereby you discern when the suffering, the disagreeable unpleasant feeling that you're

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,960
resisting basically, when the suffering is present, means it because simultaneously with it,

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,560
there is craving present. The absence of that craving, simultaneously means the absence of

28
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,160
that suffering. There is no delay. That's why you can have the direct knowledge of freedom from

29
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,560
suffering directly verified for yourself. Oh, you cannot suffer and meet suffering as the

30
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,720
Buddha would often say. Literally, amidst things that used to make you suffer, the mind cannot

31
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:42,240
suffer now because there is no more craving in regard to those things. How to abandon craving?

32
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:52,160
How to abandon craving? Well, sensory strength, virtue, developed to the extent necessary,

33
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,680
whereby you start discerning then your mental intentions, whether they're rooted in

34
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,040
wholesome and wholesome, whether they're rooted in greed, aversion, delusion. And when you know

35
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,440
that they are, you do not engage in them. You do not tolerate them, you do not entertain them,

36
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,080
you do not proliferate, you do not invest in them. That would basically enable the mind to then

37
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:22,480
not resist the unpleasant feeling, to not indulge the pleasant feeling, to not try to distract

38
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,960
yourself from a neutral feeling. And when the mind stops doing that, with the previous knowledge that

39
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,720
it has heard from outside through the sutras and the right teaching, when the mind stops doing that

40
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,920
with the previous knowledge of what craving is, you'll be able to see, ah, this is the absence of

41
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,800
craving. And you will be able to see right there, ah, there is no suffering. And then you will

42
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,240
also be able to understand what that suffering was, even the suffering of the past, before he

43
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,200
understood the way out. He wouldn't be suffering on account of that either. The same knowledge will

44
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,360
be applied to the present, past and the future.

45
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:20,800
So then how to endure those painful feelings? Do you have them now? Painful feelings, cravings, how do you?

46
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,800
Well, you endure them basically, if instead of enduring, you want to give into centrality,

47
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,320
or you want to give into a will, or distraction, while you don't do that, then that will result in

48
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,720
you having to endure them. But sometimes if, ah, you can sort of, you don't have to endure them,

49
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,600
without having to give into centrality, aversion, or delusion, then that's fine as well.

50
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,400
So you don't have to just constantly going looking for pain to endure. They've been not necessarily

51
00:05:48,400 --> 00:06:06,160
resultant wisdom. How does one know that you're free from craving? How do you know that you?

52
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,640
Because there's no suffering, I mean suffering. There's no suffering because you cannot suffer,

53
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,400
not because you're hiding away from it, or because you're not, you're just avoiding things that

54
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,480
would use to, they would use, they used to cause you to suffer. Because like avoiding things means

55
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,080
you're afraid of something already. Like say, I don't know, a person doesn't leave their

56
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,560
cutie because they don't want to talk to anyone because he might annoy them and they'll suffer.

57
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,920
So they're not free from suffering. They're just protecting their precarious environment,

58
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,280
often on disturbance. But the fact that you must protect it means you're disturbed by that,

59
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,720
which means they're not truly not suffering. They're just hiding away from the greater extent of it.

60
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,920
So you want to record, that's why like a conscious monkey doesn't neglect his duty.

61
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,280
Like certain things that you must do, they are not necessarily connected just to sitting in a

62
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,880
solitude and practicing, you know. Like here, we live by ourselves, we do things ourselves,

63
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,520
so we, you know, we have to go and fix the waterline. I have to go and patch my thing. I mean,

64
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:15,040
I don't have to, but then I won't have any water. But having to do that doesn't bother you either.

65
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,080
You're not seeking out as a distraction, but you're not running away from it when it arises on

66
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
its own as something that's necessary to be done to sustain the way you live it.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,320
So you need to have, again, that self honesty, so you know you're not hiding away, you're not

68
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,520
indulging, you're not covering anything up. With that self honesty and all the restraint of the

69
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,160
senses, seeing the danger in the slightest fault, moderation in eating, the result just in

70
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,200
obviously being mindful of your actions. You start discerning mental intentions,

71
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,560
by discerning them basically, the mind is already developing a certain perspective because

72
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,720
there is no craving without intention, but there is intention without craving. That's why our

73
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,280
hunt can still intend and decide and choose, but he has no craving. But in order to see that,

74
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,240
you have to see the intentions to begin with. Most people are not even aware of the mental

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,520
intentions. They think intention is just the most obvious choice, but it's not. It's just

76
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,560
little inclinations, thoughts in themselves are already intentional. So it's subtle, and in order

77
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,800
to reach a subtle level, this whole sensory restraint, restrained by the party mocha, by the virtue,

78
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,560
moderation eating, mindfulness is not, it's absolutely necessary, it's not negotiable.

79
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,920
And with the right instruction and the right way of looking, that's where the practice is.

80
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,680
With the other right instruction, it is just restraint, which is good, but it doesn't lead you

81
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,360
to any knowledge. But with the right instruction and that, that's all you need.

82
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,880
Because sometimes people might think, okay, the restraint is not the dama, that's true.

83
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,040
And then they would think, okay, well, now I got the dama, so I don't have to restrain, no.

84
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:05,200
Like dama applies only where the restraint is. So you can see, yeah, restraint is not the dama,

85
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,640
as in the application of the dama, is not the same as the necessary basis for that application,

86
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,800
but you wouldn't be able to apply it if there is no necessary basis. And if the mind practices

87
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:27,520
like that, then the inclination in form of craving is becoming more and more obvious. Why?

88
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,360
Because you start recognizing that the certain ways when you intend an incline,

89
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:42,400
makes you suffer, makes you feel too much, so to speak, makes you too involved, exposes you,

90
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,640
makes you liable. By discerning those things, you stop intending like that.

91
00:09:46,640 --> 00:10:02,320
By not intending like that, you're not perpetuating the craving.

92
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,040
It's in terms of feelings. Oh, yeah, so it's all, of course, it's always in relation to feelings.

93
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:33,120
Yeah. So in an agreeable feeling that is present, you have to sort of discern the inclination,

94
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,560
towards wanting more of it, or towards wanting to stay longer, or wanting to not go away so soon,

95
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,840
or towards wanting to increase it, to intensify it, to prolong it, any of those things.

96
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,040
In a disagreeable feeling, be the general disagreeable mood, or something more specific,

97
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,640
you have to remove, or rather discern, and by discerning, you remove, and automatically,

98
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,840
the inclination towards resisting it, towards trying to find the justification for it,

99
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,360
which was trying to find an explanation for it, towards psychologizing it. Just any of those things

100
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,280
are mechanisms which you try to engage in, so to remove it, get rid of it.

101
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,960
And the subtlest of them is the neutral feeling when it's neither pleasant nor unpleasant,

102
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,400
and that's when people give into distraction, delusion, indolence, laziness,

103
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,960
like mental, mental, heedlessness.

104
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:35,760
So if you don't do any of those three things, you're not prepared to do it in craving.

105
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,960
And at the same time you could be able to feel, to be aware of your feelings.

106
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,480
Oh yeah, of course. To the extent that they have a reason on their own,

107
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,960
because feelings arise having a reason they cease on their own, you're not saying that.

108
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,680
So you want to be, again, that's where mindfulness of feeling is discerning the nature basically.

109
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,080
Knowing that they have a reason on their own, this pleasant experience at the moment,

110
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,240
as a reason on its own basically, that's fine, so you don't keep,

111
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,280
I must get rid of it, because pleasure means craving, no, it doesn't.

112
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,640
Leaning too much towards that pleasure means craving.

113
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Leaning away from the disagreeable means craving.

114
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,800
Leaning towards forgetfulness and distraction and

115
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,520
leaning towards forgetfulness and distraction.

116
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,880
That means craving in the neutral feeling.

117
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:52,240
It's already been aware of those leanings towards feeling sleep, yeah, that's a good way to start.

118
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,720
So you can't like having, oh this is my craving, because craving is in your attitude,

119
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
but you can bring it down so precisely wherever you would see,

120
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,640
either the presence of suffering, or the presence of the possibility to suffer, any of those

121
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:15,200
is generated by the amount of you leaning. You'll automatically generate impossibility to

122
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:22,960
suffering, which is in itself Dukha. So you use that to know whether you lean or not,

123
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:39,760
a recognition of how liable to suffering does this make you.

124
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:53,840
There's no method that's going to show you that. Of course not, because method is on the level

125
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,000
almost like bodily action, or certainly bodily perceptions where you're just sort of

126
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,720
perceiving or going through some motions. This is what we're talking about the intentions behind

127
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,440
your actions. So whatever method you do you have to look at the intention behind which means method

128
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,480
becomes redundant, which means method is your sealer. Method is your sensory strength,

129
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:38,880
that's as close as the method as you can get. Method is your moderation in eating.

130
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,440
There's no that's noting every movement of your mind,

131
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,560
critically righted down. It's completely misplaced, looking at the wrong place.

132
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,200
Because you're not seeing your intention to note, because you couldn't be noting your intention to note.

133
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,200
Noting is an action which is already intended, which is already leaned towards,

134
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,800
and you're not seeing that, by not seeing that no amount of engaging in the

135
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,800
interaction with the reveal. Otherwise the Buddha wouldn't give in a method and describe it in

136
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,160
the sutras. When they did ask him what's the direct method he said, a young man develops faith,

137
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,280
leaves his home, lives restrained by the rules of patimoca, practices sensory strength, sees

138
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,560
the danger in the slightest fault, moderates anything and devotes his time basically to wakefulness.

139
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,880
First watch of the night, second watch of the night, third watch of the night, and then he understands

140
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,880
that the rebirth has been sort of destroyed. And I remember the first time I read that as a layman,

141
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,680
I was also looking for a method and I thought was this is just a general, why wouldn't he just give

142
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,120
you a particular recipe how to become a light, because there isn't any. This is the most particular

143
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
you can get. If you're not seeing it in a direct manner, it's just because all of the wrong views

144
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,080
they're gonna tell away. So you need to meet that Buddha's instruction halfway, basically,

145
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,840
or even two thirds of a way, to start to make sense. But if person don't change an interview,

146
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,560
then they just add, on top of their views, their notion of other practices, that's what you get.

147
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,200
Methods and modern repersonal techniques and whatnot. All methods of concentration and so on.

148
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,520
Now you have to look at the intention behind actions and you can't concentrate on that,

149
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,880
because it's behind your concentration. You can discern it, you can know it. That's

150
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,800
where it's at, the consciousness is to be fully understood. Not to concentrate it on.

151
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,880
So you can't be aware of your intention. You can be aware in that peripheral background manner,

152
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,160
but awareness and concentration in terms of techniques is not the same thing. People are not aware

153
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,920
when they're doing meditation technique, while they're opposite. They're practicing some sort of

154
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,000
focusing exercise on one thing or the other, which means there's no general awareness there.

155
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,480
To be able to see your intentions. They can only be seen indirectly.

156
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:26,240
By the way, you are, well, whatever you're choosing. They can only be seen indirectly

157
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,280
on the basis of your sensory strain and see life. You can't see them indirectly if you're on

158
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:49,200
restraint. If you're not keeping the strength, you're not keeping the seal that you know that you are intending.

159
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,680
I'm asking you intentions. I mean, yeah, you can have a notion of it to some extent, but like

160
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,280
understanding the nature, like having, having that clarity generated to the point of being able

161
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,040
to fully discern it, you won't have that. It is. It's like trying to collect the water in,

162
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,360
I don't know, 10 meter deep pool tank. We're just constantly punching hole at the bottom of it.

163
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:25,920
So it will never fill up to the bottom, to the top. And you need to have it filled up, basically.
