WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
What are you saying? Anywhere around the corner?

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Yeah, the whole work from a cherry.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Uh-huh.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
It's the way of life.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Oh yeah.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
The way of the gods.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Yeah, the way of the gods.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
The way of the gods.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
The way of the gods.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
So the more you know.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
The cleaner, the more virtues, the loftier.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
The more kind life.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
The human life is led.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
It becomes more godlike.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
The more proliferated, the more based on senses,

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
revolving around senses,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
observed in the senses,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
more animal-like is.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Based around sensual pleasures and gratification

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
and so on.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
It's more like animals.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
So that's why the human choice,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
based on which you perform certain actions,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
also not kind of determines

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
your future sort of direction.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Because it's a sort of realm

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
in between.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
It gives you glimpse about,

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
you know, animals don't have much,

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
they're fully responsible,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
but they don't have much choice.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
And they certainly can't behave like gods.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
They can sometimes exhibit human-like behaviour,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
which is already a big step forward for them anyway.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Oh, wow, look at that.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And also, when they are good for gods,

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
they can't behave.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
It's harder for them to behave like animals.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
But for human being kind of in between,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
you can get both,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
which is why the distinction is clear to you,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
which is why the human realm

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
has both suffering and pleasure

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
to such an extent that it's most optimal

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
for practice.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
You get both, you can really recognize.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Animals are just so deeply in pain, basically.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Constant drive, constant fear,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
constant need,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
no much reflection,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
so they don't really know anything better.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Gods, on the other hand,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
are usually between intoxicated with pleasure

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
and no one's never experienced pain,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
so they don't stop and think about it.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Human realm is exposed to both,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
and you kind of have the threat of the pain

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
of the suffering,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
but then you do have pleasure and gratification,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
which is also valid, valid phenomenon.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
And that's like the most optimal

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
to really develop wisdom.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
It's really, really, really spectacular,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
not just the animal,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
just to watch a god, you know?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Just to see how agitated it is.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
You can't, like, you know, when you train,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
when you train a dog,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
in order to get into the list,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
you have to get his attention.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
So then through little repetition and training,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
you keep learning how to get his attention,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
and that's when you're telling one command

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
and you always listen.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
But you realize how quickly that attention changes,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
and you know sometimes there's no point saying now,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
I don't have, like, something else has taken.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Obviously, the well-trained dog

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
would be able to be snacked out

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
of whatever has taken his attention,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
no matter what.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
But that requires, you know,

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
obviously it depends on the breed

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
and the skill of the trainer and so on.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
But it already was,

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
and when you do that,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
you notice how that attention

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
is just all over the place constantly.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Sound, sound, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
sound, sound, sound,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
around the left, right, back,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
ah, something agitates, jump, calm, hungry,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
constantly, just constantly.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
And that's the anyway,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
you know, you look at the little cute little bird,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
you look at it,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
it's just constant terror,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
constant threats,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
just keeps looking around, switching,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
buzzing, switching,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
because next moment,

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
it might be very last,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
do some attack or something.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Either birds,

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
other prey,

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
preying animals,

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I think,

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
things of that nature.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
So you're just constantly,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
and that's the anyway though,

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
constant struggle,

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
constant fight,

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
constant survival.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You do?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Like yet?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Well, the other day will.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And for some people,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
like to get into,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
like you hear this whole,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
getting into contact with the animal spirit

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
and stuff, I guess,

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
that hold it.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Well, that's ridiculous.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
You know, as you,

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
that the lion,

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
just gets, you know,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
the lion's got no feel.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You can use the similar,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
you can say,

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
the lion is the fearless,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
you become fearless,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
but you don't emulate a lion.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
No, you don't.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Because what else is lion?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
It's a killer,

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
it's a murderer,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
it's a rapist,

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
if that's what lions are.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Or when people glorify animals,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
as if they kind of have some deeper,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
six cents that we don't have.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah, they have their own ways

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
of perception, sure.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
You know, they can detect

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
subtly things,

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
better smells,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
but that's the thing.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It's not necessarily,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
it's not better,

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
it's actually more proliferated,

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
more particular,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
more based upon it,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
which means less reflection of power

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
you have in regard to your senses,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
more you pull,

05:08.000 --> 05:08.000
driven,

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
constant drive.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
That's what animals are like.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So this whole kind of, you know,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
one with a nature,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
like I'm a snow into fear,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
with a nature self.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, that's quite silly actually,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
because nature is what some sort of is.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Nature wants you to stay ignorant.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Nature is ignorant,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
and it's all about ignorance.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
So it's not the getting in touch

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
with nature,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
becoming one with nature,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
means becoming one with your ignorance,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
fully endorsing it,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
as a valid,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
as a valid thing that should be

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
cherished and protected.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Because nature is what it is,

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
and what it is,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
it's affected with religion.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
So going against the stream

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
means going against the nature.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah, sure.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
The nature of the body

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
is to run after its like,

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
senses,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
and that's what the super sick,

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
senses,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
five senses are like five wild animals,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
they have their feeding grounds,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
and that's all they want to do.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
They just want to go

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
and feed in their own feeding grounds.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Eyes will pull you towards sides,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
nose will pull you towards mouth,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
ears will pull you to the inside,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and that's what your senses are,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
and that's what nature is.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So you actually go against that,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
against the stream,

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
against the grain.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Are you going against the nature

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
or are you understanding

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
nature for what it is?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Well, that means going against the nature.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Obviously, you know,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
there are different ways you can understand

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
going against the nature.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
People can just take that to mean

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
denying the nature,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
but again,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
in order to deny something,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
that thing has to be accepted first,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
which means denial of rebellion

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
against nature is just confirmation of the nature.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Full understanding,

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
on the other hand,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
is truly going against it,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
like overcoming it,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
swimming against the stream.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
So, yeah, sure.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Going against needs to be

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
clarified,

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
like individually,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
and understood correctly,

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
whereas everything else

07:09.000 --> 07:37.000
could be things to done.

07:37.000 --> 07:46.000
One thing is,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
once a person

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
has entered the stream,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
sort of on a

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
three-metre era,

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
on someone has achieved sort of

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
one that's a guarantee

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
that he wouldn't do a lot,

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
but he wouldn't fall back to ignore us.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
So, what do you mean exactly,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
but fall back,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
before and after fall back?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
He would.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
He can't unbecome,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
a sort of one.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
He can't become profusion again.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
He can't have

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
the personality view anymore.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
He can't.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
No.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
But anything below that,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
we can break all the precepts,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
despite the popular belief.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
He can, you know,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
break all the precepts.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
He cannot practice at all.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
But it will require

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
a lot of carelessness,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
lots of exposure to unwholesome circumstances

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
for him to go that bad,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
because he inherently possesses

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
a criteria of wholesome,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
and has that permanently available view,

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
right view,

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
that he can effortlessly engage in.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
So, it's quite unlikely,

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
but it's possible,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
as they were case in the

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
cities of Adhrankin,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Sotapana and so on.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
We spoke about it before,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I think I spoke there with Tonya.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
The Sotas mentioned clearly,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
things that Sotapana cannot do,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
which is hold anything,

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
any determination is permanent,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
any determination is pleasurable,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
anything to assume to be his self.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
He can't kill his mother,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
he can't kill his father,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
he can't kill an other hand,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
he can't violate the killing,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
can't disparage the Buddha,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
or boom the Buddha,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
can't take anybody else

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
other than the Buddha

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
as his teacher.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Can I say that?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
That's all.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Change it.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Can't take,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I can't follow any other teacher.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Why?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Because the Dharma is not just a view,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
it's a recognition of the,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
like a universal criteria,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
that it claims,

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
you know,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
to recognize discern in your experience as a whole,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
which means,

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
once you discern that,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
those things are fundamental,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
those things are universal.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
So that's confirmed,

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
that becomes the core criteria for everything else.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
So whenever you come across any other view,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
it's just going to be seen as either chords

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
to the universal principle,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
the right principle,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
or it doesn't.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
So if you come across some other teaching,

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
as a Sotapani,

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
you'll see,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
ah, this actually

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
accords to the principles of the Dharma.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
So this teaching is the Dharma.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Or you'll see,

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
you know,

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
it doesn't accord the Dharma

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
for such and such reasons,

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
that's not Dharma.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
And by saying Dharma,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
it refers to that universal principle.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You don't have to call it Buddhism,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
because often,

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
today, now,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
modern Buddhism,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
contemporary Buddhism,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
there's nothing to do with the actual Dharma.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
This is the views they have evolved,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
wrong views,

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
wrong methods,

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
wrong principles,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
wrong techniques.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
So it takes a religion,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
product of society,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
ignorance,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
and so on.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
But the Dharma

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
as a universal principle stands,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
and always will stand,

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
which is why liberation always remains possible.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
As the Buddha says,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
like, really discovering an ancient path,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
and he found the Dharma,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
like that,

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
that has been worked before,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
by others,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
because he didn't create anything,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
nor invent,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
he rediscovered it,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
and then reformulated it.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So anyone,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
that develops wisdom,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
but haven't attained,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
a state,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
could develop it,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
no matter what level,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
that they fall back to Sansaara,

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
continuously.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Well, what do you mean by state?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I mean, sort of unknown.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah, yeah.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Like,

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
putugenus wisdom,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
unless he develops it enough,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
to cease to be a putugenus,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
he remains at risk.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
That's why as the Buddha pointed out,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
a person really,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
a genuine person,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
a genuine interest in practice,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
you really have to start thinking about,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
you know,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
developing a right view,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
as not an optional thing.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
It's your duty to become a Sotapana.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
And all of your faculties,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
reasoning,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
powers of reflection are intact.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You have no reason to not become a Sotapana,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
except laziness and lack of effort,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
lack of commitment,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
lack of determination,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
and so on.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Absolutely no reason.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Family, children, wives,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
husbands,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
none of that is actual excuse.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Obviously people make an excuse out of that,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
so they won't feel guilty

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
on a kind of,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
not following the way out.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
So they absolve themselves

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
from responsibility for,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
for practice,

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
for determination,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
for giving up,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
because they say,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
oh, well, I have a family,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I have duties and stuff.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah, it's a worldly duty,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
but this pertains to something much more.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
So actually,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
the worldly duty can never serve

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
as a reason,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
or as an excuse.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
It just might require more of your determination,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
but then there is no excuse

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
for not having more determination.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Unless your faculties are impaired,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
you're mad,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
they range to whatever else,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
then there is actually an excuse

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
for not doing it.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And if you stop and think about it,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
how many times have you been reborn?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
You might not know,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
but you can have a safe guess.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And if you have faith in the Buddha

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
and trusting his words,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
he said how many times,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
countless times,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
eons, and eons,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
and eons,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
and eons of rebirth

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
in every possible realm

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
that there was,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
there's nothing left,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
unexperienced,

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
unexplored,

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
or anything like that,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
so real as well.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
From that point of view,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
and that's why the Buddha

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
would talk about that,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
because from that point of view,

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
you can actually look

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
at this entire life differently,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
and real as well,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
what is one life dedicated to Dharma?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Nothing.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Because you know,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
now something feels all right.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Well, I can't give everything up

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
in this life

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
and just go and practice,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
because it just feels too much.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Well, from the perspective

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
of only this life,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
it feels too much.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
But if you start reflecting,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
like from a greater point of view,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
you realize what is one life,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
dedicated in one life,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
succeeding,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
maybe failing,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
maybe partially succeeding.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Well, at least you know you try.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Because you know,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
you can believe in rebirth or not,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
or whatever else.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
But the point is,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
you don't know those things.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
One thing you know for sure is,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
you will die.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And what if,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
the Buddha was right,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
when he was talking about

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
rebirth and everything else,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
are you willing,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
to kind of just better it,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
and gamble in it,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
and spend this life carelessly,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
doing whatever you want,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
whatever it pleases you,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
and then the Buddha turns out to be right,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
and then you end up much worse

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
for like thousands of beings.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
You know, the chances of coming back up,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
the human realm wants to fall lower

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
into any matter,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
for example,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
was like the blind seater,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
so it comes out every 500 years,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
it just comes out to the top of the sea,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
and goes down.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
So it doesn't linger.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
And then there is a yoke

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
with a piece of wood with a hole in it,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
being thrown around by the, you know,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
raised winds in the sea,

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
left and right everywhere.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
This turtle has a great chance of sticking its neck

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
through their little hole,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
then somebody who is falling back

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
onto the animal realm has a chance

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
to come back on the human realm.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
So you consider that, and like again,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
you can't have a empirical proof,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
or give me a scientific,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
but it's because science is all based on senses.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
You should expect it to experience

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
three senses as a proof

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
that which precedes your senses,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
rebuts and realms.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
But if you just allow it

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
as a valid possibility,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
you should then,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
it will become obvious that

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
the safe course of action would be,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
well, let me assume that there is

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
just in case that there is.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Because then, I'll be safe.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Rather than gambling,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and just deciding that there isn't,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
because there is no more proof

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
that there is no rebirth,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and there is a proof that there is rebirth.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
So people who say,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
well, I don't believe in rebirth,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
they are no more justified

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
than those who believe in it.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
So you won't accept both,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
and then reckon as well,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I don't really know

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
whether there is or there isn't.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Thus, I should act

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
just in case that there is.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Because if there is,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I'll be much worse off

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
if I behave as if there isn't.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Wouldn't that be,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
wouldn't that same argument be applied

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
to a lot of different views?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
What do you mean?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Like,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
just anything like, you know,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
whether it's

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
a view about how many persons,

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
or any sort of other philosophical

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
or religious view.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Well, this is not really a philosophical view.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
This clearly pertains something that precedes

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
or comes after succeeds

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
after your existence that you know.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Which means,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
it's truly metaphysical.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
It can't be experienced.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It can be speculated about.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
And that's what you reckon as.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
This is inherently never,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
can never go beyond the level of speculation.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Thus, I should act

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
just in case,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
choose a wise course of action.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
But, you know,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
views whether there is suffering

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
and there is freedom of suffering,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
that's not metaphysical.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
That's not like,

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
you know,

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
that can be speculative,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
but can also be proven

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
to yourself,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
fully understood,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
discerned,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
and confirmed.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Okay.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
So is that,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
especially like,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
you know,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
that is metaphysical?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah, exactly.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
And that's what the Buddha said.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
When he said,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
well, you don't know,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
thus, you should act.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
And actually,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
you don't even have to believe in it.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You can just use your reasoning right here

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
and now that you do have,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
and just discern.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Well, in case there is a label,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
it's actually better to behave here.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
And then, plus,

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
if I do behave here,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
people will like me here,

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
respect me here,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
find me trustworthy here,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
searchers person,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
and then they know they can rely on me.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And then if there is a next life,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
great,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
then I win,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
like on both accounts.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
I win here,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
I win in the next life.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
If there is a next life,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
well, so big,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
then we all end up the same,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
but at least here,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I live happily and respect you by others,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
and have my life smoother,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
than if I'm a crook of criminal,

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
and always worrying,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
being caught,

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
or whatever else.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
So you really,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
you don't need a proof for it.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Just use your reasoning,

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
and recognize that it's better to act as if there is.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
And that's all it matters,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
how you act right here right now.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
It doesn't matter whether there is or there isn't.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And that's why I brought this up,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
because if you start thinking that it really is,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
what is

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
dedicating this life then

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
to the practice of Dharma?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It's nothing.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
This is one life.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Big deal.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
You'll be dead anyway,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
and you know that for sure.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
And not in 50 years,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
might be much sooner,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
might be much later.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Point is,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
it will happen.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So it will come to an end.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
So having the spending your time pursuing

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
mundane goals,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
of course,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
just plain gratification

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
of your senses,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
just scratching your itch.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You know that,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
even from the worldly point of view,

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
that it doesn't amount to anything more than that.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And then you're dead.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Then your senses start breaking up.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
You can't enjoy them anymore.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Everything becomes rather unpleasant.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Your hearing goes.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Your body doesn't listen.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Sickness sets in.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And then you're dead.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
And how you spend the life,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
being completely controlled by those five wild animals,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
just yanking your left and right,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
as they please.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And now you're kind of stuck all too weak

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
to do anything better,

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
and then you're dead.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And then if there is the next life,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
then you'll be really, really screwed.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Because there's obviously the

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
what I've heard,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
common, you know,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
just enjoy the life now.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Is there anyone you can,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
anyone you have,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
just enjoy it.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Do the best you can.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Good time.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Go out.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
And then.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Great.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
But as I said,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
you don't even have to wait for the next life,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
or so you can see that,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
that view and logic,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
well, works, only body,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
you have your health,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
you have your youth,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
you have your life.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And none of those things

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
are guaranteed that you're going to have the very next moment.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
All of them are based upon a gratuitous assumption

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
that you'll live forever,

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
or at least for a long time,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
and that you will always be healthy.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Well, yeah, life is happening

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
so that you can go out and enjoy it.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
But what about the person who's

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
going to go out and enjoy it?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Or what about you just next day,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
you'll find you have cancer.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Does it work?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
It doesn't work.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
How are you going to enjoy that?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
What happens to that view then,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
when you realize,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
I'm subject to death,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
and now it's confirmed.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
And those of you,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
that's a fact,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
you're going to die,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
what's going to happen afterwards as much.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
So what's the point?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
What's the point of life, you know,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
you can just say,

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
if you have the view that this is all there is,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
you know,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
you say they don't think very far

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
further than that, really.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
You know, because if you think further than that,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
what,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
then what's the point of anything?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Is it really the point

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
just to be enjoying?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Again, as I was just said,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
like a few minutes ago,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
I'm saying,

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
like those people having a view,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
this is all there is,

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
well,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
that's something you decided,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
as a view,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
you don't know that for a fact.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
So you're no more justified in deciding that,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
than deciding,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
you know, this isn't all there is.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
And as it turns out,

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
you're less justified,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
why?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Because that's much,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
less,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
much riskier,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
course of assumption,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
or this is all there is,

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
to which you can,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
while you can.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
And then you realize,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
well, what if this isn't all there is,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
and all my time that I had,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I spent misbehaving

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and just running after like an animal,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
after any gratification I could get?

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Then you end up much worse.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
So you want to consider it,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
that you don't know,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
whether this is all there is,

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
thus it's better to act,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
as if it isn't all there is.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Why?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Because if there is something afterwards,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
those people who do say that

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
there is something afterwards,

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
they say,

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
because of that,

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
you should behave right here right now.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
And there is a good sense in that.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
And you can see that for yourself,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
right here, right now,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
even as a protuginous,

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
protuginous can see that as well.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
And then obviously,

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
if you want even more,

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
if you want to be free

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
from suffering right here,

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
right now,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
let alone any future,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
instances,

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
then yeah,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
you have to apply yourself even harder,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
but again,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
it comes from the,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
from the same perspective,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
except in the fact,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
well rather,

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
recognizing the fact,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
that one thing is sure is,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
you will grow sick,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
age and dying.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
That's it.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
So, you know,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
spend your life enjoying your senses,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
works when you're 20-year-old,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
when you think you live forever.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Mind you,

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
you can be 50-year-old

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
and still say that,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
because you think you live forever,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
and you're healthy at the time.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
But find your sick person,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
in a hospital,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
bedridden,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
saying that,

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
holding that view.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh yeah,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
enjoy your life.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
This is great.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
See,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
and I'm still alive,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
bedridden in a hospital,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
oozing out,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
whatever I,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I don't know,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
depending on the illness,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
I guess.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
And,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
and that person,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
would they be saying,

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
oh yeah,

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
enjoy your senses while you,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
while you're still alive?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
They might be telling others that.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, they might,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
oh see,

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
now I'm sick,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
really make the most of it.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
And they might listen

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
because the others are not sick.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
They're intoxicated

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
with health.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
And you know that,

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
for yourself,

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
everybody experienced

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
that more or less,

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
when you're healthy,

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
you don't care,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
when you get sick,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
then you get all really worried,

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
and then you're,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
oh,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
and you got sick

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
because of your stupidity

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
or foolishness,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
and then you make all those grand,

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
they think, oh,

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
never did that again.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
And then you recover,

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
and then you're back

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
to the old ways

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
you completely forgot.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
It's pure intoxication.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
It's what you have at the time.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
It's like,

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
complete,

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
like the mindfulness.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Absence.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
And saying,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
you make grand plans

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
and projects,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
and ideas,

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
and hopes,

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
and whatever else,

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
just because you assume

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
you will live forever,

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
you assume your life

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
will last for a long time.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
And if you stop

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
and think about that assumption,

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
it's completely gratuitous.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
As every assumption is,

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
but this one,

26:25.000 --> 26:35.000
it really can hit you.

26:35.000 --> 26:43.000
So, as Buddha said,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
even if somebody went for,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
and they don't achieve anything,

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
but they don't disrupt the state,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
they keep the rules,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
and they keep trying to practice.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Even if they don't get anywhere,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
even if they spend every single day,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
for the rest of their life,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
in tears, in pain,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
imposed by the restraint,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
it's still better than going back.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Why?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Because you've been around so long,

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
so many times,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
it's spending

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
a third of your lifetime now,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
crying in pain,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
but holding that restraint,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
will actually contribute much more,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
than just giving in to the senses.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
And then, at the same time,

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
we stop thinking,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
well, it's impossible to spend every single day,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
for the rest of your life,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
in tears, in pain.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
No matter how great that pain is,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
it will fade.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
But if you're ready for every single day of pain,

27:40.000 --> 28:07.000
anything less than that will be a blessing.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
And people, nobody likes this strain,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
because it feels like a chore.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
It feels like an effort.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And it feels like that,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
only from the point of view,

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
where your sensuality feels effortless.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Now, the actual gratification of the senses,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
might feel effortless,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
but it never comes on its own.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
It always comes with a price.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
And it's not seeing the connection

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
between sensuality and gratification

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
and the price and the toll it takes.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
You reflect on the connection long enough,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
and it would become apparent

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
because it is there.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
And then you realize,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
it's much harder,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
much more taxing,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
much more,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
much more of a chore,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
to be following your senses,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
and enjoying them,

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
then saying no to the whole thing.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
But that connection needs to be well on long enough

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
until it becomes apparent,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
because it's not apparent,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
because if it were apparent so easily,

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
everybody would be free from sensuality.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
And you can start with a simple reflection of,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
if you are a layperson,

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
living a household life,

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
enjoying the pleasures of your senses,

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
means pleasant pastes,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
touches sounds,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
finding a pleasant wife,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
or a girlfriend,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
living a pleasant life.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
How do you achieve that?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
You need to work.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
You need to earn.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
You need to really

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
put up with stuff you don't like,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
very often.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
You might find the work you like,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
you might be your own boss,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
but then you have to protect it.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
You have to fend off.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
People who want the same.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
People who cheated,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
people who lie,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and people want to take things away from you.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
So there's always that risk.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Then you're committing your life to it.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
You're spending 90% of doing things

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
you don't want,

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
just so you get that 5% enjoyment.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
It doesn't feel directly related to it,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
and that's the ignorance,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
obscuring it.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
But if you realize that it's impossible

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
to have enjoyment,

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
without 95% of pain revolving around it,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
directly or indirectly,

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
you realize that enjoyment is not worth it.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And that's when the Buddha talks about

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
seeing the danger

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
in the sensuality.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
So by choosing to pursue

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
the ways of the senses,

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
which is basically choosing to have family,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
children, wives or husbands,

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
whatever else,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
living that kind of life,

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
you accept that whole central domain

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
with these things pertain,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
with these things are,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
which means you don't practice restraint,

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
but you practice pursuit.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And that's a form of commitment.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Pursuing your senses is a form of commitment,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
but then you realize,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
by accepting, by engaging in that pursuit,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
you make yourself liable

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
to a great loss.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
So say, you commit yourself to a pursuit

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
of having a family,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
having children.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
Well, now that you have family and children,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
you have to work harder for them.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
For the food, for the clothing, for the school.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
What if they get sick?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
What if they die on you?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
You spent 20, 30 years,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
cultivating, investing in those things,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
dedicating your whole life,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
praising your children,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
then they turn away on you,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
or they die, or an accident happened,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and they just snatched away

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
in a second,

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
and you have not had say in that

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
from the beginning.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Like, from the day one,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
you have no say in the destiny of your child.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Well, you have no say in your own destiny,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
but you have ignored that

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
when you decided to pursue the senses.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
But if you reflect on that,

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
you realize that even the pursuit of the senses

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
is actually completely out of your hands.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
That's why the suitors compare it to climbing a tree.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Oh, you see the ripe mangoes

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
on the tree, so you climb the tree

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
to eat them, to enjoy them.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
And then somebody else while you're on top of that tree

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
comes, and he can't climb the tree,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
so he decides to cut it.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
While you're still on the top,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
he doesn't see or he doesn't care.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
You chop the tree, you fall down, break in there,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
and you're done.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
And pursue the senses

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
exposes you to that,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
means going down, or climbing up the tree,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
off a kind,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
or the other,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
and something might come at a direct cross-purpose

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
and just snatch it away from you.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Be it an accident, being other people,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
being both.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Who knows?

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
The point is, the exposure is there.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
So there is the inherent danger in that pursuit.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
So you realize that danger is 95% of luck.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Easy worth risking your life,

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
putting your head on a chopping block

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
when there is a good chance of accident falling down,

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
just so you get that 5% thrill.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And in this worth,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
that gratification is worth

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
for as long as you don't establish that connection

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
between the two.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
I, for as long as you don't see the danger in centrality.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
You establish the connection

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
and then the danger became apparent.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
The visible.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
The mind turned away.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Spear is the passion.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
As the suit is described.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
Oh, like the disgust became real.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
This is danger.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
This is not like mind turned away.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Never to go back to it.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Why?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Because it is like that.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Essentiality and gratification

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
would not inherently be dangerous

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
and risky,

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
and much more revolving around pain

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
in this satisfaction.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
If it wouldn't be inherently that,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
then it wouldn't be unholy.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
And that certainly freedom from it would not be possible.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
But because it is inherently dangerous, risky,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
and not worthy,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
it is inherently like that.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
But dwelling on that freedom from it is possible.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
And then you realize,

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
saying no as a formal restraint to centrality,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
it's 5% of effort,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
95% of peace,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
and it's well worth it.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
And that's when you find,

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
when a person finds pleasure over renunciation,

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
like actually you experience pleasure

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
by being, by recognizing strength

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
that you have of saying no,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
not being you are stronger than senses,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
senses are not stronger than you.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
There's also a view that you will actually

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
through those challenges in life.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
If you're having a family in the child,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
you will get to know yourself.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Yeah.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
You will evolve.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
You will evolve in a way,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
in a discovering different ways

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
of pursuing the senses.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
But whether you evolve this way or that way,

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
bottom line is,

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
it's still within the nature of pursuing the senses,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
and that's still within the nature of their danger and risk.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
Does any evolving that you do

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
will be within that?

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
It's basically like going in a muddy swamp

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
and finding different ways

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
to wash yourself with a muddy water.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
No matter how liberated your ways become,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
it's still filled with water.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Means you'll never be clean.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Evolving the same way.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Evolving.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
Like, you can be in prison.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
In prison, behind a low door.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Sure, you can evolve in that environment.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Whatever evolving you do,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
it will be evolving in the prison.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
But you really want to be out of the prison.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
It's better to be uninvolved out of the prison

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
than involved in very common sense in the prison.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Because that's not really involvement.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
It's just a further proliferation.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
And it's people say that they never say

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
for any other sense,

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
any other purpose than a purpose of justifying their pursuit

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
of the senses upon which they already decided.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
But now they need to keep justifying it.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
And sure, you can.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
But you do that to others

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
because you might feel guilty,

37:05.000 --> 37:11.000
or you might feel watched or judged.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
So you justify yourself.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But basically,

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
that's done already when you're deeply committed to the senses.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
So now you're just trying to make the best out of it.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Cover up any doubt in regard to your choices,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
in regard to your commitment.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Above all, observe all the responsibility for it.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Oh, well, you know, I can't.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
I can't go forth now because I have wife and children.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Well, they were not given to you,

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
like, you know, out of nowhere.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
You've chosen that.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
So basically what you're saying,

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
you can't go forth because of the choices you make.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
And the choices that you're still accepting.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
And that means you can't go forth

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
because you're choosing to not go forth.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
That's it.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Oh, if you put it like that,

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
you realize I'm so responsible for them going forth,

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
for not practicing the Dharma.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
So saying, oh, well, you evolve,

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
you grow as a fight by engaging in these challenges.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's like, well, you really grow

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
by recognizing how to completely overcome those challenges

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
so they don't rise.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Why would you keep yourself in the environment

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
where those challenges will be coming the over?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
It's silly.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Surely the wisdom is finding a place

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
that's free from any challenge.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
But only a person who doesn't know how to free himself

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
from their challenges will say,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
no, no, no, challenges are good.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
They only say that because they don't know how to escape

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
and how to overcome them.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
So they need to make himself feel important

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
or more valuable than they actually are.

38:54.000 --> 39:13.000
I remember we spoke a while back about seeing an attractive thing.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I see.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
We see an attractive object.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I can quite a bit.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
It feels painful if I...

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Yeah.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
So if I see a beautiful woman

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
walking around in the city,

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
I don't try to drown this.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
But I can see the beauty from the corner of my eye.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
I don't have to look at it.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I can see it on the other side of the road.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
And then I have to restrain myself.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
But I was reflecting on the third of it.

39:50.000 --> 39:57.000
That sign of beauty comes with pain somehow.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Yeah.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
That's what I was saying before.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
That sign of beauty is that which is painful.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
It's not the restraint.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Yes, not the restraint.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
Because when you say no to a prospect of pleasure

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
that it's pulling you,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
whether it's a pleasurable sight,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
sound, smell or any other sense,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
it feels like the pain has a reason

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
because you said no.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
You finally go with it.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
No, the pain has a reason

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
because you've been yanked by that enemy

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
of that sense.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
It's just usually you immediately go with it

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
so there is no yank.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Like as the leash starts pulling you,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
you go with it.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
So there is no tension created.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
So you just feel smooth sailing

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
because you're just being driven.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
When you start reflecting on it,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
you sort of don't go instantaneously

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and then there is a pain arising.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
And you think, oh, this pain has a reason

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
because I didn't go immediately

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
with this animal that pulled me

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
and animal of sight.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
But actually, no.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
You go step further and you realize no.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
The pain has a reason

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
because it's stupid.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
The animal yanked me.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
And for as long as I go with it,

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
it will keep yanking

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
because I'm allowing you to do it.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Same you take a dog on a leash

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
you let it yank your arm

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
and that's what I get used to.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
So instead of going with it,

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
you invest the effort

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
to overpower that yank

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
so you actually control the animal.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
And then eventually animal learns

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
it's pointless to yank.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I won't be let go when I am.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
And then it listens.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
And then it goes where you did it after to go.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
But then that's what it is.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
But that needs to...

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
So yeah, the inevitable...

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Oh, I've been yanked.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
It's because I didn't go with the animal as quickly

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
as I should have.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
But no, you've been yanked

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
because the animal pulled you.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
So you have to endure that initial pain

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
and also see through it

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
as not originating from you saying no

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
to the animal that started to run

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
with you holding on to its chain.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
But it has a reason

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
because the animal is wild.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
The animal is untrained, the animal ends.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
The eye goes towards that...

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Exactly. The eye goes for the sights.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
And that's what...

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
So when there is a pain of a pleasurable sight,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
it's because of the eye goes there

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
not because you're saying no to it.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
And you stick to saying no to it

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
until eventually you overpower the eye

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
and it stops yanking here.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Because it realized it's pointless.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
You know, you tie the dog

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
to a post.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
It will yank and yank.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
And then no, the post doesn't budge.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
It doesn't break.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
It will sit down and calm down.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
And actually that's a super similar.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
When you, like a strong post,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
you tie this fire animals to the chain.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
They will go wild and try to pull the rope.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
When they come break it eventually,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
they'll quiet down and sit down.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
And then you can take them off for a walk

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and they'll be there.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
Let the training of the senses.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
Because with the eye,

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
you're going into the city

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
where it likes pretty girls, beautiful women.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
And like I said, now,

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
you can see that it's not yours

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
because you realize

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
that you're all of a sudden

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
you're looking at this pretty girl

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
on the outside of the road.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
But the whole time, your attention,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
your intention was, say,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
you're looking at the pavement,

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
following you or whatever.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
And then all of a sudden my head turns,

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
my vision turns to that specific thing,

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
which I can say.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I can say, yeah, that's attractive.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
From the hundreds of people walking around.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
We're not attractive.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
We're not a joke.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I picked the one which I'm not even looking at.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
I'm not attractive.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
It's because my eye is not mine.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
It's seen more than what I'm looking at.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
The eye wants that.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
The eye sees that.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
The eye sees that.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
And it's the same,

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
like the same,

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
the suit I was talking about yesterday,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
when the weather asked the man,

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
what do you think,

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
which is more numerous,

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
things that you haven't seen

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
or things that you've seen.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Things that you haven't seen, obviously.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
You use, because of that,

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
you abandon all the things that you've seen.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
All the things that you will see

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
with always be less numerous

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
the things that are unseen.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Thus, but reflecting on that,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
unseen, we can abandon

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
everything that you've seen

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
and you will see.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
In the same sense,

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
which is more numerous?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Beautiful or ugly?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Ugly.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Out of 100 people,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
you might find one or five attractive.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Yet,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
there of the same material,

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
of the same make,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
like 95 unattractive ones,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
old, sick, aging,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
overweights,

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
whatever,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
things you don't find attractive,

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
they're more numerous

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
than the ones you pick as attractive.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
So you realize

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
how circumstantial attractive this is,

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
and how random,

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
and how exactly,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
nothing to do with you.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
It's entirely your eye,

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
finding this circumstantially pleasing.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
But you just run with it,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
why because it pulls you?

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Because you don't know any better.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
And that's it.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
So that's why

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
a protrusion that can free himself from sensuality.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Obviously,

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
there will be a lot of wisdom.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
It's quite unlikely

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
that a protrusion of free from sensuality

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
that has come across

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Buddha's teaching

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
wouldn't discern enough

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
to get the right view either.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Like, it's unlikely.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Because it's kind of along

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
the same way of abandoning assumptions.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
But it is possible,

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
technically,

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
seeing they've never had

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
a protrusion,

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
it's possible, why?

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Because those things are obvious.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Well, not obvious.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Sorry, those things can be discerned,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
can be made obvious.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
That is what's insured it is.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
It's pain.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
And by going with it,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
you avoid the pain of the yank

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
or the pull.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Well, especially,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
imagine if you're a weak little man,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
have a massive

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
rot-weather,

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
or even some crossbreed,

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
and bull-master,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
powerful dog.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Oh, you better go with it.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Because it will rip your arm out.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
But when you go with it?

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Well, exactly.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Go with it means

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
you're going to end up

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
in the places you don't want to be.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Yeah.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Inevitably.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
You'll be dragged over things

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
just so you get a final satisfaction

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
while the animal wants.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
But 95% of it,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
you'll be dragged over thorns

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
and bushes and sharp rocks

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
and whatever else.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
You have to put up with

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
just so you get that last moment of

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
life.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Oh, okay, I go with it.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
And then another one.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
And then another one.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
And then another one.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
So it's much better actually

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
to start developing your arms

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
so you can overpower the animal

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
rather than animal overpowering you.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
It will take time,

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
but there's any other strength

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
development will,

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
physical and mental.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
Yeah.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Everything takes time,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
but it's worth it.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
And in this case,

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
obviously,

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
pretending to the mind,

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
it's, well,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
the benefits are immeasurable.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
There's that,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
one translation

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
in the 60-year fighter.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
I don't know what to say about this,

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
but it's his guide.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Not guiding the doors,

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
well, guiding the doors of the

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
senses is quite good in there.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
We said guiding the aperture

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
of the senses,

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
apertures.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
I don't know.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
It sounded quite nice,

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
because...

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
What was that?

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
A sutra.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Yeah, a sutra in the fighter.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Someone just translated

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
guiding the apertures

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
of the senses,

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
which just seems a bit more...

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
I don't know.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Because you can get that sense

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
or that sense of that door

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
of the senses.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Yeah.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
That's all you're doing.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
You're not trying to,

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
you're trying to be pulled into,

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
into this.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Yeah.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
That sense of that door.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
So it's not,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
it's not like...

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
You can't just go 24-7

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
saying no,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
go everything.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
It's just going to collapse.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
You can't,

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
you can't sustain that.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
So you discern

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
when a dog is about to pull you,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
when a wild animal of the senses

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
is about to pull you.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
What direction is heading?

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
Olsum or an Olsum?

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Olsum?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Fine.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Go.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Don't go too fast.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Don't let it yank you.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
So, be mindful in other words.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
Okay, you have to eat.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
The animal of the taste

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
will inevitably enjoy it,

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
but you also have to eat.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
So,

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
you do let the animal go and eat.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
But you're mindful of it,

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
so make sure

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
it's not about enjoyment.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
It's about eating.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
But you don't go,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
you don't have to go

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
for the wild music parties.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Or, you know,

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
even worse,

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
take drugs

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
or immoral sexual behavior

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
or who knows what else.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
You don't have to do that.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
So,

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
you don't let the animal go there.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
If animal is used to going there,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
which every animal is,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
it will hurt saying no to that animal,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
because it will keep yanking you.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
You're yanking you.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
You're yanking you.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
But you do as well.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It can't yank me forever.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
But if I do give in,

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
well,

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
it will end up yanking me for much longer.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
And,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
you have 95% of pain

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
revolving around it.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Being dragged out of your control.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
And then you come up with a counter.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Once you, you know,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
when you think yanks you,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
if you stand your ground still,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
you can withstand.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
But if you give in,

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
when the animal picks up more pace,

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
more speed,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
then it's much harder to stop.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Then you just have to wait for the crash

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and hope to survive the crash,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
and then restart again.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Oh, painful elephant,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
like so many similes in the suit.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Power is there,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
a pain,

50:39.000 --> 50:46.000
in full control.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
So,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
this is in regard to yourself,

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
your own senses,

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
which means,

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
like, you know,

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
teaching an animal,

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
a dog,

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
training it,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
training to listen to your voice.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Well,

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
it's identical.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
You have to train yourself

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
to listen to your voice,

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
the voice of reason,

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
of wisdom,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
of discernment.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Because, you know,

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
people know,

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
deep down,

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
you know,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
whether you're just giving in,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
or whether you're going about it.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
As soon as you look,

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
you know.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
That's right.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Because you know,

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
you feel guilty,

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
and that's where I need to come up

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
with those excuses

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
that, that time,

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
you just listed the people

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
who will often say,

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
ah,

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
it's a real great deal.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
This is the real challenge.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
There's no nonsense.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
You do that only just to cover up

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
your sense of guilt

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and response really.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
You know deep down inside,

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
what are you doing,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
whether you're doing what it's,

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
whether it's indulgent or not.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
But it's awesome, right?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Awesome.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
You just have to listen.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Learn how to listen to that.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Or rather,

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
you have to make that voice powerful

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
to override the pull of the senses.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
So when that voice says no,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
there is absolutely no debate.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
The animals stay still.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
And it's far from impossible.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
This takes a method.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
But everything takes effort.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Being yanked by an animal

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
takes effort,

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
it's indulgence.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
Putting up with things.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
And that's much worse

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
because you're not in control at all.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
So sometimes it can take you down a way

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
that ends up fatal,

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
or much worse than what you anticipate

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
as people often do.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
And that's based on sensuality.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
But saying no,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
and investing in training,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
your mind to be stronger

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
than the senses,

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
is like,

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
well,

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
there's nothing dangerous about that.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
All on the contrary.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Thus,

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
even if you spend your entire life

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
for the rest of your life in tears

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
and pain of restraint,

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
it's still more awesome

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
and more peaceful actually

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
than being driven around

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
by the fine wild animals.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Did you know?

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
You can teach them how to enjoy other things.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Well, that's the thing.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
When they're prevented

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
from going wild

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
as far as they can,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
then they started joining what they have.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
What you give them.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
Yes, sir.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
That's how I work.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
And that's actually,

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
there is another suit

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
where the Buddha says that

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
to a venerable ameluda,

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
just practice janas,

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
which is like the ultimate

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
establishments of your mind,

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
the strength,

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
which is developed.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Why?

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
Because if you develop janas,

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
then the course

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
rice that you're eating

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
will feel like the finest

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
hand-picked rice grains

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
from, you know,

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
the most,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
the richest caries.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
So the course rice

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
would feel the finest.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Why?

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Because that's what you gave your mind.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
And that's where your mind

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
got established.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
And now it finds

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
tremendous contentment.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
And that's it.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Contentment comes from the mind.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
It doesn't come from

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
the prey that your animals chase

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
and hunt.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
You prevent that.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Then they'll have to settle

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
with what they have.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
And when they do,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
then you have even more.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Then he said,

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
practice janas

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
because they,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
the course hand probes

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
that you wear

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
will feel

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
will be perceived

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
as finest

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Kashmir silk.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Practice janas

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
because sleeping

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
on the root of

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
three or cage

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
like this where we are now

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
will feel like

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
spending time

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
in the fully-plasted

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
mentions,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
King's palaces.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Why?

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Because the mind

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
determines

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
how it's going to feel

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
like.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Undeveloped mind

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
will need more

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
to get any sense

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
of gratification,

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
fully-developed mind

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
warning any

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
essential

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
to get sense of

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
content and gratification.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Which people work

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
for their whole lives.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
They give you

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
all life,

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
sleeping, you know.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Having a boss

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
whom you hate

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
who is abusing you

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
to make you do things

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
you don't want,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
colleagues you don't trust.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
And you just have

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
your friends.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Well, like,

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
keep a living with your family

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
that you don't get on with.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
They,

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
that's human life.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
You spend your whole life

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
why?

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
For that

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
five percent of the

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
that they find

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
like itch,

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
just rickering the

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
itch open,

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
bleeding out.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
But having

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
a little sense of

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
gratification of

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
scratching it,

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
to scratch,

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
just a bit.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Ignoring 95% of the

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
mess you're creating

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
just because they're

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
tiny little scratch.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
And then,

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
compared that to the pleasure

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
of somebody

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
whose itchy wounds

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
have healed completely

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
and it feels

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
nowhere to whatsoever

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
at all

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
ever again.

55:42.000 --> 56:09.000
You can't even compare it.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Are you right about

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
that?

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Yeah.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I mean, I was thinking

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
the other day too,

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
and when I'm meeting

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
these British bulls

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
and like,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
this

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
brown rice and all of that,

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I'm enjoying it

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
far much better than

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
anything I used to have.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
In the earlier times,

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
I went to

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
the...

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Well, you can see that.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Like, you can see it.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
You know,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
when you have a plate full

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
of a table full of different

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
plates of food,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
and you just, you know,

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
go for the ones

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
really you like,

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
and the mind gets overly

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
excited all the way.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
You kind of get

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
some enjoyment,

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
but it's not

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
the same as if like,

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
when you're like this

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
in the middle of the jungle,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
no village inside,

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
nothing,

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
and then you have some

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
plain food,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
but that's all you have.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
It feels much

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
more gratifying

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
and satisfying

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
than when you have a full

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
plate full table of

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
all sorts of plates and stuff.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
When you're just so concerned

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
about picking the word

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
exactly what you want,

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
if you don't end up

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
really

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
appreciating anything.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
It will, if you

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
if you only eat

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
when you're hungry,

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
I mean,

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
whatever you eat.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Exactly.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
If you only eat

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
when you're hungry,

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
whatever you eat,

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
you'll enjoy it.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Yeah, if you can drink it.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Like, if you just try

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
to fast drink

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
two days.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Then,

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
then like, you know,

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
the plainest

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
cream crack is

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
well, you know,

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
when you haven't

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
been eating for days.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
So it's just like

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
how far your animals

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
have proliferated.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
How far they

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
you got used to going.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
As I say, you have a

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
wild dog.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
He's just used to

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
running around

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
wherever he wants.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
But you can't expect him

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
to be content

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
sitting in one spot.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
He won't.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
He will be

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
angry,

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
mad.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
But he will come down.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Training.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
That's why

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
the suit is off to

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
about training.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Training yourself.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
They're becoming

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
a master of your sense of

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
him.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
And it's not

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
which we need to be

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
then you become a

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
master of your life.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Well, then wisdom is

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
easy.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
You're not being

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
distracted,

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
pulled around,

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
controlled by your

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
senses.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Insight is just

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
the matter of time.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
So,

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
you're not

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
being distracted,

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
pulled around,

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
controlled by

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
your senses.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Insight is just

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
the matter of time.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
Yeah.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
You start to see

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
way more things.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
Is it obvious?

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Then you need

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
very little instruction.

59:05.000 --> 59:05.000
You don't need a

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
PhD or a degree of

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
listening.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
A job.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Work yourself up.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Get out.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
Because you've got

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
your senses already.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Well, the senses

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
got you.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Changing it

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
around.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
So,

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
you're not

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
being distracted.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
You're not being

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
distracted.

59:21.000 --> 59:21.000
You're not being

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
distracted.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
You're not being

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
distracted.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
You're not being

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
distracted.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
You're not being

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
distracted.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
So,

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
you're not being

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
distracted.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
You're not being

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
distracted.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
You're not being

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
distracted.

59:35.000 --> 59:35.000
You're not being

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
distracted.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Well, yeah.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
All the

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
pursuits were

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
the ambitious stuff

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
comes through the

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
senses.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Through wanting more

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
for your senses.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
You know,

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
later on security,

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
safety,

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
all of that comes

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
comes through

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
being controlled

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
by the senses.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Living on that

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
domain,

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
where those

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
animals control

59:55.000 --> 59:55.000
you and

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
pull you around,

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
pull you apart

59:57.000 --> 59:57.500
as they please.

59:57.500 --> 59:57.500
So, sometimes people

59:57.500 --> 01:00:03.300
it, some restraint, just don't run out just now, wait, because then you can run further

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:08.740
later, but it still pertains to the same round, same yank, same pull by the same animal

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:15.300
with the same chain. So you really want to start addressing the nature of being pulled

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:21.820
by your senses. In other words, you really want to start addressing the unwholesome pull

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:37.740
and then controlling the wholesome ones. And you address that then it becomes apparent

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:45.060
that it was never you who was going after sights. It couldn't have been you because sights

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:52.260
pertain to your eyes. That's why it's called Salayatuna, 6th sense space. Then you have

01:00:52.260 --> 01:01:02.940
the 5 senses and in the sutras they refer to as fields, which means these fields are

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:11.460
where these sights run and pertain to, which means your eyes goes after the sights. By

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:18.460
being constantly pulled, you just stop, you don't even see that. All you see is me and

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.500
the stuff around sights around. So you end up appropriating, you end up thinking you

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:28.220
are those animals. But you start distinguishing yourself, there is no sight without this

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:36.740
fleshy organ of my eyes, inconceivable to have sights, to see sights, even eyes. Same for

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:43.940
any other of the 5 senses, inconceivable without the corresponding sense. So if you think

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:49.980
inconceivable without which means it's inseparable from, it's fully determined by, it's fully

01:01:49.980 --> 01:02:03.140
bound by, it's fully made by that, which means you and your senses self is completely redundant.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:09.580
And that can be discerned even when you are not free from sensuality. But imagine how

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:14.620
easy that would be to discern when you are not being driven around by those animals.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:19.300
Then you just see, hey, I have no interest in this at all and now I have proven that to

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:24.940
myself, I have confirmed it to myself, better world than proven, I have confirmed for myself

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:29.540
that I have no interest in it because I am in control, not the animals. And all you see

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:34.140
is just pathetic animals trying to run left and right. And then even they will come down

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:42.180
eventually. And then it becomes apparent, yeah, this was not mine to begin with. Because

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:49.180
if it were yours, you would have say in it, if it were yours, those eyes would not be

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.980
subject to destruction, subject to sickness, subject to death. You wouldn't, but they are,

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.900
which means it's all yours. You can't have it both.
