00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
So it's about the ownership of a sense of self, that's your mistake, not the existence of your sense of self.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
But usually people who jump into conclusion, ah, no self means there is no self.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Well, who is then talking and deciding and making all these choices?

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
And then if actually said I read in the suitors carefully, the Buddha never said there is no self.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
But actually people ask him, so his master got them as saying there is self, and he'll be quiet.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Ah, so master got them as saying there is no self, and he'll be quiet.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
Because either way, for this person self is already there, ownership is already there, and he can't see the ownership.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
And that's where the problem is.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
So, do you feel like you're your own?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
No.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
How come?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Because I cannot control my...

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Well, in hindsight when you think about it, sure.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
But say something that you wish for comes your way.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Are you happy and elated and accountable?

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Something that you don't wish for comes your way.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Are you said about it?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yes.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Means there is ownership in regard to the senses that can experience these things.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
So then you can't say, oh, I don't regard myself as my own.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
You might wish to not regard yourself as your own, but practically facts are showing you that you do,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
because you still are liable to suffer and feel on account of changing things.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
And that's really the problem.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It's all about denying things, denying yourself.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
It's just gratuitous ownership that we exercise over our own senses.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
And if you want the weather, you're exercising ownership, and I'm just asking yourself,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
would I suffer if something changes that I don't like?

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
If you wouldn't suffer, means, okay, I'm along the right path.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
That's why that self-honestly needs to become first.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
When the weather said person needs to understand, there is good action, there is bad action,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
there is a good result, bad result, there is the given, there is this, there is the practice.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Because if a person is denying all of that, then exactly, they wouldn't necessarily see where the problem is

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
and where to apply their effort.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
And then it would be like, oh, there is no self, so what is there for me to do anyway?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, there is no self, you can say that, but there is suffering.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
You're still liable to suffering, and that's what you need to do.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And once you start doing that right, you get to understand, that's what it would have meant by not self.

02:10.000 --> 02:18.000
It's what the suffering is, not any kind of random theoretical scientific sense of experiment that proves that nothing's real and but not.

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
Because when he approached the first disciples after his enlightenment, they asked him, oh, what teaching?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
And he didn't say, oh, I'm telling you, there is no self.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
He just said, there is suffering, and I'm teaching freedom from it.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
Because that's something that everybody can universally relate to.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
When he met the man before that, in the same suit, when he was going down the road, and this man sees me,

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
oh, you look very bright, very composed, who's teaching did you follow to develop those faculties?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
And he said, I follow no one's teaching.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm my only leader.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm the supreme ruler of humans and gods.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm the best, which is pure fact.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Nothing conceded about it.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
But in this man's eyes, through his own conceit, all he could see is like, I am the best.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
And I was so beat and left.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I didn't want to hear the rest, what I'm going to have to say.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
So clearly, by the time the Buddha reached these other disciples, he realized if he approaches them with a sense of,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I know what the truth is, they're going to be undefensive.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
But he does know what the truth is, but people won't hear it.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
So then he related that which they can relate to internally, which is, you're liable to suffering.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Even if you don't necessarily suffer, you are liable.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
And eventually you will have to, old age, sickness, death, inevitable.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And I'm teaching freedom from it.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
And I was like, oh, okay.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Like, oh, yeah, I want that.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
And that's how they start to listen to him.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Although they tried to dismiss him first, because he wasn't part of the group anymore.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Anyway, that's it.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
So that's, in answer to the question, there is no self, there is self.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
But you should try not to own it.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Because you can just say, oh, there is no self, there is both, there is neither.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Factually, you remain liable to suffering and you don't know the way out.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
And that's the core of the teaching, suffering and freedom from it.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
And that brings me to practice of matter.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Well, you want to ask yourself, why do you want to do it?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Why are you doing it?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
What's the purpose of imitations?

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
Personally, I want to focus myself.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
That is my main thing.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And what would be the purpose of that?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
To calm my mind.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
And what would be the purpose of that?

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Why do you prefer a calm mind?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Again, yes, free of suffering.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Because a non-calm mind bothers you.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
So why go a round way about it when you can start thinking about what makes calm mind calm?

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Or what disrupt the mind?

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
Does sense desire disrupt the mind if you want something that you don't have?

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Does somebody say something upsetting and you refuse to let go of it?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Does that disrupt the mind?

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
So you realize you don't need to do meditation to calm your mind.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
You need to stop disrupting it yourself with your own choices and actions.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And then meditation comes out of that.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Usually people hear about meditation and they use it wrongly in a sense of,

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
you try to replace issues with matter.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Like, oh, if I do matter, it will come in place of this.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
But the place of your problem is not in things.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
The place of your disturbed mind is not in because somebody said something upsetting to you.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
It's because your mind got upset when I count something that's being said to it.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
And you can't replace that.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
You can only train it to not do that anymore.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
And then you realize, I don't need to suffer, I made suffering.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
That's what Buddha said if the mind is developed.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
You would endure the unpleasant harsh insults, words, attacks,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
in the same sense you endure wind, cold, sun, like elements.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Completely nothing personal about it.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
But you take the ownership of it and it's automatically personal.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
And then you don't have to deal with it.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And then you hear about matter and not use specifically.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Everybody does by that.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
And then you hope, if I develop this meditation, someone's meditation will push this whole thing out

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
and I will never be able to get angry or something like that.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
You get angry by giving into anger.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
You get lustful by giving into lust, by making choices based upon it,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
by having non-restraint.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Because that's what's in common, by the way, to pursuing sensual desire,

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
acting out anger, acting out of carelessness is lack of restraint,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
lack of self-control.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
So then you could draw a line and say that, oh, so your mind gets disturbed

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
when you don't have enough control over yourself.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
And that's entirely up to you.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Nobody can control you for you.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
And people don't have enough control over themselves

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
because they don't think enough about it.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
They expect circumstances to control them,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
whatever tradition, duty, values.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And they do to some extent, but you want to take it on a new level

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
whereby you take control of your sensory strength,

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
of your verbal actions, of your physical actions.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
That's already the beginning of wisdom.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Five precepts will then take it for a rate, precepts and so on.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
So we have to always start with the five precepts.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Not just you have to start.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
You always stay within them, by the way.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Like, even when you start practicing meditation,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
then you don't do it, it's within the five precepts,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
so you just continuation of the same principle.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Of that sense of non-disturb mind that comes from controlling your actions.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
That's why literally, in its core, the Buddha said,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
he teaches action and freedom from action.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And action is already a choice.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
It's already on a level of an action.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Hey boy, it's okay.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
It's okay, man.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Do you think he wants to go out?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
No, I think he's just strangers in his space.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
He wants to let you know the boss is.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Oh, yes, he is.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Okay, he's not used to it.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
So, I mean, like, you have to be very disciplined

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
and following precepts and all that

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
before we can actually develop wisdom.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Well, that's already the beginning of wisdom.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
It's a mistake to separate it.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
It's a mistake to think our wisdom will then come after it.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Doing that is already the beginning of wisdom.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Because you're already becoming transparent in regard to your own motives.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Where your intentions and choices are rooted.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And then you would know, little, this isn't wholesome.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Like, this is rooted in completely unskillful desires in me.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
The world can praise it.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
They can say, this is a great thing to do.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
You have so much passion.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
But from the standpoint of wanting to have a mind that is calm,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
you realize, no, this is incompatible.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I can't have that.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And the reason why people have entertained these things is because they don't.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
They don't accept.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
They don't look at it.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
They're not transparent.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
They don't know it.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Because everybody wants to have their mind calm.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Even people say they don't.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
They do.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
That's why you always pursue pleasure and stuff.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Because it's satisfaction.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It's already a form of calmness.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And that's what people have dependent on it.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Because they don't know any other type of satisfaction.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Except, like, central satisfaction or satisfaction.

09:01.000 --> 09:12.000
Real will and retaliation and so on.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Okay.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
So, my question is, if the Buddha intended to not be worshipped as a god

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
or any part of his musical self idolized as a Buddhist,

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
is it acceptable to visit places like the lot of Maligawa

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
to worship his sacred tooth or Adam's tooth to worship his footprint?

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
The thing is, not all people do their...

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
And neither Buddha is going to do their practice for the same reason.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
So, if you visit Maligawa because it will just remind you of the Buddha

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
and the possibility of enlightenment, that's fine.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
And the Buddha did say, yeah, when they're asking, what should we worship when you die?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
There were no statues.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
And he said, make no statues of me.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
He was only came later with the Greeks when they came to India.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
But he got quickly established because it's easier for people to worship

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
something that resembles a person or rather than these symbols

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
that already require a degree of wisdom and recognition.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
However, the Buddha did say you can worship the symbol.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Like, by the body tree, they will remind you of enlightenment.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
You might think about enlightenment.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
You might spell something in you that you maybe want to do it.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
You should worship the sign of an arms ball, which means there's a possibility

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
to give up the world and be renounced.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
And then to see the reminds you of the teaching and so on.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
So, it's all these symbolic things.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Just they might make somebody think about a dharma.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
And that's it. That was the sole purpose of worship.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
But nowadays, most people worship out of superstition.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
And there is absolutely nothing to do with Buddhist teaching or Buddhism.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
But that is what Buddhism is today.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Whatever the other religion is today.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
It's firstly superstition.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
And then within that, those who are interested in modern superstition

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
get to find out the teaching.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
So, if you visit Maligava so you can pass your test exams,

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
it has absolutely nothing to do with anything that Buddha taught.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
If you visit Maligava because you want your wishes to come true,

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
again, it's completely misplaced.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
If you visit, because another way of misplacing it, if you think you can visit shrines

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
and somehow get closer to enlightenment simply by physically visiting, you know,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
stupas and whatnot, there's absolutely nothing to do with it.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
The enlightenment can only come with the self-restraint, understanding and wisdom.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
And so, in that sense, this can be helpful.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
You get inspired maybe and then you want to read the Buddhist teaching.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Once you visited some statue or something.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But it's a very remote sense.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
And I often come to people who think, as long as you worship,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
you're somehow getting closer to nibana.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
And that's just wishful thinking.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
That is how it is presented.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, of course, because it's much easier than if I tell you,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
no, you need to be perfectly restrained.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
You need to give up things you like.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
And sometimes in you, the things you don't like.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
You don't want to hear that.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Only few people can hear that and accept it.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
So, it's easier for me as well to just hear.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
It's just very respect and challenge this.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You'll be fine.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
You'll be able to do nibanas and all that.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I wonder what they say about Amisupu Jain,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
what they thought they were in those days.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
In his teachings.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Nothing.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Nothing.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
He said about alms and being generous.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Not just amongst, but in general.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
That's like making money.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
But that's not bringing you closer to enlightenment.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
They're just bringing you closer to a more wholesome mind,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
better rebirths and so on.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
But in enlightenment, you need to abandon it all.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
You can't like give your way in terms of gifts to enlightenment.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
It doesn't work like that.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
And that's the problem.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
It's not a problem that you don't necessarily pursue enlightenment.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
But the problem is when people then intentionally develop a view

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
that, oh, I don't need to pursue it.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And I can do this.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
And by doing these random things, I'm somehow also getting closer to it.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And because of that, you never really admit to yourself

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
that you're not getting closer to enlightenment

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
just by random acts of generosity.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And even good karma when you accumulate so many.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
It's still karma.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
It is still karma.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
That's the whole point.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
That's what I mean.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
He teaches action and freedom from action.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
And action is good action and bad action.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
So, yes, you need to replace bad action with good action.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
But now you need to abandon that as well.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
If you really want enlightenment.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
And for that, you can't have like good action

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
somehow resulting self-cancelling action

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
and you become fully enlightened on a hunt.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Because, literally, we will just prescribe.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Give this, give this, give this, and you'll be enlightened.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
But it didn't.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Never.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
It has to come within anyways, right?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Somebody cannot.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Like somebody can write you.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
That's why he himself says whatever is to obtain,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
to be obtained by the manly effort.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I've done it.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And that's why it cannot be taken away.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Because you do it for yourself.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
It doesn't depend on the external factors.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
It's not given to you like, you know,

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
sudden divine providence.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It's just no.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
It doesn't come that way.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So, in that sense, that's what I mean.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
If you're clear as to why and what for,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
and keep clarifying if you're not clear,

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
then you get to realize what you really want.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And then you get to do it properly as well

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
without misconceiving it.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
And you might be fine.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Like, god, man, look, enlightenment seems too far out of my reach.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
But let me then focus on things that are not without my reach.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
That the Buddha himself, who might respect enough to follow the teaching,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
said, a layman should do.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
But it's where layman, like, especially in the West,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
or who it is for 20 years practicing,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
and they don't even keep the presets.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Doing meditation retreats and stuff,

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
still drink alcohol and it's like, no restraint.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And as I could see, the contradiction you're living

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
is because of your own ignorance.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
No one else's fault.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
But if you were to make the effort,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
instead of having a wishful thinking of your genres and whatnot,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
focus on what you are first and perfect that.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And then you see whether you're happy with it,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
or whether you will come among,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
or commit your restaurant to retreat.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
But they want to have it all at the same time.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Oh, I can also practice for enlightenment.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And I can also, you know,

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
have my desires as a layperson and so on.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
So you have to pick one.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You have to recognize what your situation is

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
and take responsibility for it.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Okay.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Because that's what I mean.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
If you renounce the world,

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
it's because you chose to do so.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
If you don't renounce the world,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
it's because you chose to do so.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
There's no external authority or criteria

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
that demands from you to stay layperson or not.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It's purely my choice.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
But every choice means you're responsible for it.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And that's the bit that people try to avoid because it's unpleasant.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
See, if I accept responsibility

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
that I'm not renouncing the world,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
means I have to accept responsibility for anything

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
that comes at me from that world that I haven't renounced.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
I have to accept responsibility for anything that results

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
out of my unenlightened mind.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I can't complain about it.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
Because I choose to remain in the environment

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
where these things can happen.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
And that's not easy to bear necessarily for everyone.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
So people would then try to kind of mask that.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And then at the same time,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
develop a sense that,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
but no, I am still practicing renunciation

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
and everything while I'm not really.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
So you just need to learn how to be really, really,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
even brutally honest with yourself.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Nobody else.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
What are you doing and why are you doing it?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Same.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I want to meditate.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Why?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Why?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Why?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Why?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Because I don't want to suffer.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
So how do I suffer when I don't meditate?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Not necessarily.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Do I suffer when I act out unwholesomely?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Oh, that's the root of my suffering.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
So let me deal with that,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
and then maybe meditation will become more obvious later.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
But for people,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
as I said,

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
meditation becomes extension of what I want fulfilled for me.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And that's why I want work.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Not in the manner released.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Okay.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
So I have a question that I was thinking about.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
So I was wondering,

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
how do you decide what is a comfort or something

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
that you need to give up?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Because I have some of my questions,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
so also another part I was thinking about

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
was the use of technology inputs

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
like phones, for example.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Is that allowed?

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Is that not if you were pursuing the path of enlightenment?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Those are tools.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Okay.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
It's not tools are not necessarily wrong.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
It's the purpose of the use.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
So if you use your phone to cheat,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
steal, engage in sensuality,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
spread hate, it's wrong.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
But it's not the usage of the phone that's wrong.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
It's your intention and your action

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
that's being acted out by the phone.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
If you use the phone to Google the suitors

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
and read the translations online,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
it's of course not wrong.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
If you use the phone to communicate when communication is needed,

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
it's not wrong.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
If you use the phone to just chit chat random gossip,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
it's wrong, but again, not because of the phone,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
but because of the intention behind your action

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
and what you're doing.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
So that's why it's not like,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
it's not prescribed.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Like, you know, you have those Christian orders where you shun

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
or you must shun anything new and stuff.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Not at all.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
It's the tool.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
You mustn't shun your responsibility for your actions.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
But people try to like throw away the tools

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
because then they will blame the responsibility

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
and the tools.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
See, it's the phone's fault.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
It's the internet's fault that I can't be restrained.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
No, it's your own fault that you're not restrained.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Okay, so technology is okay in the lab.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Exactly.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It's why you're using your fault.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
It always defines whether it's right or wrong.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
So that's why it can't be a blanked one.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
No, technology is absolutely fine or it's absolutely wrong

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
because people will use it for different purposes.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Same, like knives, folks.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
You can use the harm somebody with it.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Right.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Or you keep very practical.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
You can't survive in the wilderness without it.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
So.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Okay.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
So another question I had was,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
okay, so the concept of, you know,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
reincarnation and good karma and bad karma.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
So, you know, I guess, like,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
if my understanding is correct,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
when you accumulate good karma and bad karma,

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
it goes, I guess, in terms of when you're being reborn,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
in terms of, you know,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
how you'd be reborn into your next life, essentially.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
How do you, like, so my question is, I guess, essentially, like,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
how about this current life?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Like, how do you end suffering when you're in the present?

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Right.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, yeah, that's the point.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
If you were to approve the desire from your mind

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
and concede, you would be approving any basis for suffering.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Okay.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
So.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
That's how you do it.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Okay.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
But that's something you can't do in a sense of just perform.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
That's something that you can't just be generous,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
pay your way to your life when you're just generous,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
or something, because that's just another level of doing.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
So that's what I would say.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
First, you need to be very sensory-strained.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
You need to keep the presets and restrain your desires

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
and only recognize things that, okay, I, you know,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I need to give into this or something like that.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
But not like, as a blanket mode of being,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
whereby you always say yes,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
and then only sometimes say no when you can't get what you want.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
It's out of the way around.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
It's more like, no, I'll keep myself in check only when I can't,

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
but even then means I'm responsible for it.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
That's the first step.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
There has to be, to fully accept that you are responsible.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
See, people think they suffer because things are unpleasant,

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
but you don't.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
You suffer because you resist the displeasure that you feel.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
So suffering itself is a concept.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Pain is not suffering.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Right.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Resisting pain by default is suffering.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
That's, that's why the craving is the root of suffering,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
not feeling is the root of suffering.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Okay.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So if you want to be free from suffering this life,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
you have to stop craving, stop resisting, stop indulging.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Right.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
What you feel right here right now.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Okay.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
And the first step is to stop acting blindly

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
on account of what you feel right here right now.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Right.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Then you get to round up and see, okay.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
So you're not acting by the body, you're not acting by the speech,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
and then you get to see how your mind is affected by what you feel right now.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And that's where the craving is, in your mind.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
But you cannot prove the craving in your mind

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
while your physical actions are still very much engaging.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Okay.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
And rooted in that same craving.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Okay.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
So suffering itself is like how you, how you perceive something

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
or how you, how you conceive and how you conceive something

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
and that is what causes, brings you that stuff later, right?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Yes.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
It's slightly more immediate than that though.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Okay.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
It's literally when you are touched by disagreeable,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
your mind automatically leans away from it.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Right.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
That's the default.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Okay.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
When you're touched by agreeable, your mind automatically leans towards it.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Right.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And is that leaning is the root of suffering.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Oh.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Not being touched in the first place.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Okay.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
That's why in the cases of fully enlightened monks,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
you know, something they got attacked under the road and stabbed and stuff,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
and they didn't suffer on account of it.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
It doesn't mean they didn't feel the physical discomfort on account of it.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
They did.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
They did, right.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
But you realize that was never really the problem.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
The problem was you're not being able to not lean towards or against

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
when you're touched by a feeling.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Okay.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
And you couldn't do it because you haven't understood it.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
And that's why the sensory strain needs to come first because by default,

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
people would first and foremost blame the external world for whatever they felt.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
See, I feel the suffering because such and such person upset me.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
No, such and such person had something to say disagreeable to you,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
but you leaning away, trying to get the radio, trying to override the

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
disagreeability in you, that's your suffering.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Not what they said.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
But if you never look in that direction, you'll remain blaming them

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
and then feeling justified in hating them and so on.

23:01.000 --> 23:26.000
So first that needs to be restrained and then you get to understand what the problem really is.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
Yeah.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I think I have one more.

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
So do you love any one of these thinking?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't know.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I was just wondering, so I was just thinking,

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
how can I make sure to use the full path and I'm such in my daily life?

23:53.000 --> 24:03.000
Like making sure the five precepts also make sure that I follow the right action and the right speed.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
Well, within the five precepts, that's only the type of right action.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
So you can follow five precepts by the body and follow them by the speech

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
and then you can extend the same practice on the mind.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
And that's exactly, that's kind of the order you can develop as well.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
You can't extend them on the mind while your body is not restrained.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
But usually people associate a precept or just a bodily commandment or something like that.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
They're principles that you need to start applying first onto the body.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
But then yes, so you're not obviously killing anybody physically,

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
but you might have harmful thoughts that you're harboring and detaining, thinking intentionally.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
You will not act, you will not harm physically anybody,

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
but you might be gossiping or slandering somebody out of the same ill will.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
It would result in someone else's committing killing.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
So then you realize, so yeah, I'm obviously keeping the five precepts on the level of the body,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
but why don't I restrain my mind from thinking bad and harmful thoughts towards others?

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
So you use the same principle of five precepts and restraint

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
by applying it now on an even more accurate level, which is the level of your mind.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
So even if you're not drinking, stealing, cheating, lying and so on,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
but am I thinking about these things?

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Am I thinking thoughts that are rooted in the same basis

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
that result sometimes in cheating or stealing, getting what I want on account of, you know,

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
sort of screwing up others and so on?

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Am I thinking thoughts that are just unrestrained, sensual?

25:31.000 --> 25:39.000
Am I thinking thoughts that are maybe not sensual but careless, harmful to me, to others,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
and they're not doing on that mental level either?

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Because it is a choice as well, it's just most people are not aware of that choice

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
because they're not even aware of the bodily choices they make.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
But once you start restraining that, these will become more obvious.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Okay.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
So the key essentially is to start by controlling those atmospherically

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and then moving on to the mind.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
Yeah, and then the mind will become apparent within those physical restraint that you just created.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
I got it.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
So it's like trying to tame wild dogs while they're still wild.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
You know, if you keep trying to chase them or something, good luck.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
You never know it.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
So you first put up a fence.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
You round up a perimeter and then within that you get to see, you get to learn about it

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
and then become more familiar with it and then they start to listen to you.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
But most people won't arrive at that stage of like full control,

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
commanding the senses in the mind without even having set up the basic fence around the behavior.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
And then they hope like somehow meditation will magically bridge their gap.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Right.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
Oh, I don't want this religious sign of restraint and whatever.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Just teach me meditation and enlightenment.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Right.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
I mean, even when the Buddha died, there's all these other hands,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
like 500 fully enlightened monks came together.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
And so let's re-decide the teaching so that it gets remembered.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
And then they said, well, what do we recite first?

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
We recite our rules, patimaka, sensory strain, presets or do we recite dharma first?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And you would think, of course, you recite dharma says no.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
There is no dharma without the basis of rules.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
So we must recite the rules first.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
So they called one who knew all the rules and he recited all the rules and how they came to be.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
And only when there was completely exhausted.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Okay.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
Now let us recite the words of the Buddha himself, not before the rules have been recited.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
So if the other hands needed to follow that order,

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
if the fully enlightened people needed to follow that order,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
what is to say for somebody who's just starting their practice?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
It's not optional.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Most of the time it is the other way around.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Are you completely?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Yes.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
I know the West especially.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
Because in the West people don't even have the traditional kind of imposed values

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
and anything vaguely religious, it's dismissed as a religious oppression.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Right.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
So you can't even talk about restraint without them associating that with like, you know,

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
crazy Christian times, you know, 17th and 18th century in Europe,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
but it's just like you kill people who don't keep commandments,

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
which is against the commandment, but the irony was lost in them, I guess.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
So, and then they hear like, you know, the esoteric Buddhism, whatever else,

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
and then they hear meditation and they think, oh, if I just get the right meditation,

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
that's it.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I don't need to deal with anything else.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
And, you know, sometimes you have all these other schools of Buddhism like later on that came.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
They're very much cater to that.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Oh, you don't need this.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
No, no, no.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
You can be married and be a monk.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
You can do this and be a monk.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
You can do the ambient light.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
And it sounds like one of those fake adults that you can have it all for 199, you know.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.000
And it's just, but people believe in it because they want to believe in it.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Because it's easier.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
And they are comfortable.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Of course.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah, exactly.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
And they're like, oh, I need to give anything else.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It's so difficult to achieve.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Yeah.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Yeah.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
But that's what I mean.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
You might realize that it's not that difficult if you actually start accepting responsibility

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
for what you already are doing.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
It's nothing out of the audience.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
It's just because you ignore it.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
You keep it in this project and now I can't pass on.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
No, wait.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Wait, wait.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Let me accept this first and then I'll see.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Maybe I can get more.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Maybe I want more.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
So you get to learn as a result of it.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Okay.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Can I ask a question?

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
How long have you been in your life?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
15 years.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
15 years?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
2005.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
I started as a layman but a couple of years before that, like reading the sutas and keeping

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
the presets.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
And you were always interested in that?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
No, no, no.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
One of us was 22.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Okay.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Before that I was very much not interested in any of that.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Any of that.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
But at the same time I was becoming dissatisfied with just a genetic, you know, sensual lifestyle.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
And I got interested in meditation as every westerner does without religion.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Right.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
But I had like nobody really like to ask for Buddhist groups.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Nothing.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
And not really other religious groups at the time.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Certainly not in my city.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
So I was just going to go to a library and read the books.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Religion and philosophy.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
So I was reading everything.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Hinduism and yoga, all sorts of things.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Christianistics, everything, everything.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
And nothing was...

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
And then I came and exited across the book of Yugoslavia monk in Sri Lanka in the 60s.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
And then he translated the actual sutas.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
And yeah, I read the first sutas of suffering, freedom, liability.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
And I had that recognition that, yeah, my life is really good.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
I was actually working for an American company more money than I can spend.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Absolutely no problem with that.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
But at the same time you recognize you are liable to things changing.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And I could not ignore that.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Oh, I could all work out for the best.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Okay, well if it doesn't.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
You see people around you, it doesn't always work out for the best.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
But you just pretend that your life will always be the best manner you want yet.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
So I was just becoming aware of the fact that there was nothing particular bothering me,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
but I was becoming aware of the fact that some things could bother you.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
And you won't have a control over it.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
And there was beginning to bother me.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
That recognition.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
So then I sort of wind down my lifestyle.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Big by bit.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
I saved up some money and went to become one.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
And because that's the thing I felt responsible.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Oh, I don't have to become one.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
It's not an imperative.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
But if I choose to stay in this life, whatever, in 30 years time,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
if things that I don't like happen to me, it's on me.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Because I chose to stay.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Because now I know there is a way out, in terms of what is teaching,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
but I chose to not follow it.

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
Because I'm now responsible for whatever stages are the result of not following the way out.

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
Some people decide to stay, but to me, there was not a right choice.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Doesn't mean it was easy to leave.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
But it was, yeah, it felt like a duty.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Something we're doing.

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
I understand impermanence in like a logical way.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Exactly.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
But my parents are older, and I don't think they are going to be around too long.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
How do I prepare myself to, I mean, I know, like, I know, like...

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Well, no, that's not a knowledge.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Like, that's information.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
You have information about impermanence, but you have no understanding of it.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
Because if you truly understand impermanence, it results in the removal of any ownership you might have

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
over your parents and your own life.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
But you still have the ownership because you still feel that you're liable to suffer, exactly.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Which means you haven't understood impermanence then.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
So you need to understand impermanence by starting, like, not in that logical manner,

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
but realize that, like, what you're currently feeling now, right here, right now,

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
whatever, good or bad or neutral, doesn't matter what it is.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
It's already something that's not in your control.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
And you don't need to go into, like, psychological and scientific explanation

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
as to why it's not in your control.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
It doesn't matter why.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
The fact is that it's not in your control, yet you are acting as if it is in your control.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
I mean, did you have any say in your parents getting old?

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
It's even inconceivable as an abstract thought to have a say in it.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
Yet here we are acting as if it shouldn't happen.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
So, again, you can continue acting like that, and that's where you remain liable

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
to when those things happen, remain liable to being affected by them.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Or you can start uprooting those gratuators' wrong views.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Yeah, but that's what we're going to say.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
You just watch your nostrils and you become an iron.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
And here you reflect on the nature of things, the nature of your actions, the nature of your choices.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Think about it.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Because by thinking about it, you stop ignoring the obvious that you're not in control.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
And people ignore the obvious because lack of control from the point of view of control is very unpleasant.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
It's anxiety and fear and all of it.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
But it's only so because you completely ignore it and then only sometimes it's thrown on you.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
But if you actually start thinking about it in a measured manner and stop ignoring it,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
it will cease to scare you.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
Because you realize, well, when I'm afraid not, this is the factual state of affairs.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
That's when I was saying that this morning to one of the monks, that's when the Buddha died,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
some monks were not fully enlightened.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
They were like, now what will happen now?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
But the monks, they were enlightened.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
They were saying, of course, how can that which was born not die?

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
I mean, for them, it became inconceivable to grieve over it.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It's madness, in a way.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
How can you, like, they couldn't fathom it.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
How can you grieve over it?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Over something that's obviously have to go.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Yet people grieve over things that have to go.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
And they know they have to go, but they still grieve over things.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Why?

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
Because you ignore the fact that we will go and only address it when you have no choice about it.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
Same, like contemplation of, you know, I'll get old, I'll get sick.

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
And that's why I'm going to say that you are responsible for that, because you keep yourself

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
pretty much intoxicated, like a drunk man, with life, with health, and with youth.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
You know it will go away, but you don't think about it.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
And by not thinking about it, you intoxicate yourself with it while it's present.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
That's why a healthy man always thinks he'll be healthy.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
And even when you think about non-healthy, you think like in a second person manner,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
not like something that directly applies to me.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
Because if I start thinking, no, no, no, it's this health, it's this youth, you're going to feel that.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
And, you know, you're so used to avoiding what you feel, or only chasing what you want to feel,

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
that by default you will be turning away from it.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
So that's why we'll compare the practice of dummies going against the grain.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Now, against the string.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
Not like denying everything, but basically seeing the things are rooted and then stop ignoring it.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
By not ignoring it, you see the origin of this.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
Oh, I'm intoxicating because now I'm healthy, but do I have even say in this health?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
Who knows, I might be having cancer growing in me or something like that.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
You get scared.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
Well, the only reason you got scared is because you refuse to think about it.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
It's like the most certain thing, by the way, when you think about it.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Death.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
As soon as you're born, it's absolutely a must.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Everything else is optional.

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
Yet the most certain thing is like the last thing a people's mind.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
Because they choose to put it last and keep it last and press it there to be last,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
because it's too unpleasant to admit it.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
But if you train yourself towards that unpleasantness, it won't be unpleasant anymore.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
It's only unpleasant because the dog chases you only because you start running away from it.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
If you stand your ground, it won't chase you.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
It won't even attack you.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
But if you give in to the run, it will go after you.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
And that's exactly.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
You start giving in to avoiding this, and that's how it goes after you.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
It's okay.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
It's okay.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
It's okay.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
It's okay.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
It's okay.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
It's okay.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
It's okay.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
It's okay.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Yeah, we're all good questions.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Mm-hmm.

36:52.000 --> 37:18.000
Mm-hmm.
