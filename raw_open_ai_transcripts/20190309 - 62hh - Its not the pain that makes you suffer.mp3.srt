1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,920
So, a simple question, why is pain a problem, because I don't want it, I don't want it.

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,200
So which is first, you don't want it, that's it's a problem, or it's a problem that's

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:38,160
you don't want it? What is first, Mark? Yeah, sure, pain is not wanted, pain is a problem.

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:49,080
Why is a pain a problem that's unwanted? Because I don't want it. So, you make it a

5
00:00:49,080 --> 00:01:02,280
problem, because you don't want it. So, if you stop resisting pain, as in stop trying

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:11,560
to get rid of the pain, pain ceases to be a problem.

7
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:25,080
Well, it depends what you mean by that, whether you mean too much of painfulness of the pain,

8
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,440
in which case, well as long as you're still alive, it's not too much. Or you mean this

9
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,720
is too much of a problem for me, so I don't want it. So, if you don't have a problem

10
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,200
with pain, then there cannot be too much of a pain. And that's why we're going to get

11
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,360
that example of highway robbers sawing your limbs one by one. And if the mind has ill

12
00:01:52,360 --> 00:02:01,480
willed towards them, it means it hasn't fulfilled the teaching. Because by fulfilling the dama,

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:09,280
it's inconceivable to have ill will towards pain, or those who cause it. It is just inconceivable

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,520
because it was not conceivable to begin with, but it was your ignorance of it, it was conceiving

15
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:25,800
it. But again, back to the same simple question, which is a reflection anybody can do. Why

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:36,000
is painful feeling a problem? Because I prefer pleasure. Yeah, so why would I prefer pleasure?

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,280
It's not pain. Which is why, why is it better then? You realize you won't find an objective

18
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,800
answer to it. You have an attitude of no wanting pain, and you have an attitude of wanting pleasure,

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,200
and your whole life is dictated by that. But if you look at an attitude as to why is that

20
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,880
attitude there, you won't find an answer. It's good to do attitude. And that's the only

21
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:15,360
thing, the only one and only reason for human suffering of any kind. That's what it meant

22
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:28,360
by craving means suffering. I want this, I don't want this. But even if even if a person

23
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,280
just starts reflecting, don't jump into answering right away. So just why is pain any pain physical

24
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,400
emotion or any pain? Any disagreeable feeling that I'm experiencing, why is it not wanted

25
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:57,280
by default? Why is that my default attitude? And by putting yourself in such a question,

26
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,640
without providing a rational answer, you're becoming aware of that problem, the problem

27
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,800
of your attitude. And sometimes yes, sometimes maybe you have to keep that question for days

28
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,320
as a way of contemplation. No, you have to keep repeating it. Just don't answer it. Keep

29
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,840
asking yourself, but look for an answer, but don't answer it. So you're looking, but you

30
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,600
are not allowing yourself to formulate it in the irrational, psychologicalism manner.

31
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,160
Because you really want to become aware of that emotional level of your resistance to

32
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,840
the unpleasant emotion. Yeah, you can give this answer to that answer, but emotionally,

33
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,960
you'll still be resisting it, or you would still want to prolong it if it's pleasure.

34
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:54,280
But there is absolutely no justifiable reason for not wanting pain. Because if your attitude

35
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:02,880
towards your feelings matters, you would feel only what you want to feel. In other words,

36
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,160
feelings would be obeying the attitude. But the fact that you're experiencing pain, which

37
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,720
is not wanted, means you have absolutely no say in the domain of feeling. The domain

38
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:25,240
of feeling is unaware of your resistance. Feeling, feelings feel, pleasant feeling feels

39
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,960
pleasure, unpleasant feeling feels unpleasant pleasure, this pleasure. Neutral feeling feels

40
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,800
neither. That's it. You don't exist for it. Your attitude is a self-assumed parasite

41
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,600
upon it, because of which you suffer. Like the experience of pain does not experience

42
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,000
the dukkha. The experience of pain, you're resisting it, you experience the dukkha. That's

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,560
where you get to be free from suffering, and your sense of self, and the gratitude is assumption

44
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,640
and everything else. But then pleasure, displeasure, and neutral remains. Because they have never

45
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:12,120
a problem. Pain is inevitable. Well, exactly. Inasmuch as any feeling is inevitable for

46
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,040
as long as you're alive. Either pleasure, displeasure, or neither pleasure nor displeasure.

47
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:25,680
But the attitude is... Get you this. Yeah? Option. Well, it's not optional. It's either

48
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,400
you have attitude or you have undone the attitude. It's not option. Maybe the type of attitude,

49
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,600
but even the type of attitude is not optional. Because in pleasure, you will always be wanting

50
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,040
more pleasure in pain. You will always want to try and get rid of it. In a neutral feeling,

51
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,680
you're always going to distract yourself from it. So your attitude is determined by the craving.

52
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:57,400
Pouring has set outcomes. What's optional is how you're going to go about it. But that's

53
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,800
already far down the line. It's not fundamental. Fundamental is the attitude of wanting, no one.

54
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,360
Fundamental is the attitude. Fundamental is craving. Craving for what? Well, craving for

55
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,640
pleasure in what pleasure? Cream for more pleasure in pleasure. Craving for absence of pain in

56
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:19,320
pain. Craving for distraction or pleasure in neither pleasure nor unpleasant feeling. But

57
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,960
that attitude can become apparent if you start questioning yourself in regard to the presently

58
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,520
enduring feeling. What am I feeling now? Whether something happened to you, somebody said something

59
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:36,760
you're upset. Pain. Why do I need to... Well, first, you have to stop projecting the blame,

60
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:44,680
so to speak, and responsibility onto the world for your pain. Because as long as you still think

61
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,720
that I'm suffering because such and such person said this and this, you have a lot of work to

62
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,520
do, basically, as in you have many views to undo. When you take responsibility for how you're

63
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,520
feeling and stop blaming the world, then you might be able to start discerning your attitude

64
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,120
in regard to your own feeling as a primary and only one and only source of your suffering.

65
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,520
But obviously a person who is fully projected onto the world being the reason for my pain,

66
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,040
they can never see that because they haven't taken responsibility for it.

67
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,200
But say you've taken responsibility for you being affected by your feelings,

68
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:41,280
so you stop trying to talk things out with somebody upset you. If that's sort of done to

69
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,440
maintain social norms, that's fine. But you don't do it as a means of escape from your feeling.

70
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,680
You recognize that responsibility for you being affected by what's being felt is when you.

71
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,040
Not from the circumstances, not from the elements, not from other people, not of who said what,

72
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,080
not of all the disrespect me enough or they didn't do this or they didn't do that, no.

73
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,520
All of that is you took for granted the attitude of trying to get rid of this unpleasureable feeling

74
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,280
and then where you look, where would you go about it? He said this, it's his fault.

75
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,040
This happened, I didn't have enough luck, it's everyone else's fault.

76
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,160
Even if people are genuinely rude and need to you, if you suffer and encounter it, that's on you.

77
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,360
That's what it would have said, the wise mind, the one with the well wisdom and the right view,

78
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,880
would endure harsh words, slander and all this, in the same sense you would endure elements,

79
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,760
in the same sense you would endure heat called hunger,

80
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,600
insect bites, slanderous and abusive words, because it's on the same level, it's just element.

81
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
But you being upset and account of it, that's on you.

82
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
So why is pain a problem?

83
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,280
In order to reveal the attitude, your attitude that makes it a problem, that feeds the attitude,

84
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,640
that makes it a problem, that feeds the attitude, vicious circle, in order to reveal it,

85
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,920
you have to stop blaming pain for the problem, for the problem.

86
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,440
So why is pain a problem? You realize, no, why do I have a problem with pain?

87
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,720
That's a more accurate question, because pain in itself isn't the problem,

88
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,560
but there is a problem in regard to the pain. Why is that? Because the pain is not wanted.

89
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,640
Why? Why is the pain not wanted? Okay, I wanted it. Why would you want it?

90
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,800
Why do you have to either want or not want? Why can you just be

91
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:06,560
equanimous in regard to either? Okay, I don't want pain, but I do not want pain to either.

92
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,560
Any pain, big or small, far and near, past, future, any attitude in regard to any pain.

93
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:26,320
So if you stop trying to get rid of it, then the attitude towards pleasure becomes also apparent.

94
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,680
Stop trying to entertain it, stop trying to make it so longer, stop trying to get more of it.

95
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
So automatically, by discerning the nature of your attitude of its pain,

96
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,480
you also start discerning the nature of your attitude towards pleasure, the gratuitous assumption

97
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:52,400
of sensuality, sensual desire and pleasure you get from it. That doesn't mean you stop perceiving

98
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,560
agreeable and disagreeable things, but that's one thing, another thing is craving for more of it

99
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:06,960
and craving for their absence and craving for your distraction. So if a nature of pain ceases to

100
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:16,880
be a problem for a person, there's nothing else to do because it doesn't matter where it comes from,

101
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,280
from what sense, from what thought, from what experience, from what circumstance. Pain is not

102
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:31,040
resisted, pain is not feared, pain is not wanted either, because sometimes people would go the

103
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,200
other way and overly indulge pain as a mean of showing that you know. No, if pain is a reason,

104
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,400
it doesn't matter, that's not a problem, it's a secondary thing. So if pain arises on the kind of

105
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,120
your restraint and determination and willpower, you have no problem with it.

106
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,120
If pain arises on the kind of somebody abusing you or fending you whatever,

107
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,320
you have no problem with it either. But you don't allow yourself to be abused.

108
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,640
Well, you allow yourself to be abused when you give in to the attitude of its pain,

109
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,240
you become abused. That's the whole point. Because a lot of people think that.

110
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,560
Like yeah, the circumstances are abusive, but you are not abused until you put the projection

111
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,400
on the circumstances for that abuse. If you realize that abuse, that abuse is founded

112
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:36,080
upon your attitude towards the experienced feeling in the time. So if that attitude is

113
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,040
attitude of, I don't want this, you made yourself affected by that abuse.

114
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,840
So I'm a sort of sexual abuse and sexual. Well, how can you be sexually abused? The body can be

115
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,680
sexually abused, physically abused. But that's the kind of normal sexual relationship with people.

116
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,480
Exactly, yeah. Which means that people go through this, they take the ownership of the body to be

117
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:09,040
theirs. But we all know how that ends. Sickness, aging, and death. Which means it was a mistake to

118
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:16,720
take it as yours. And you better undo that mistake while you're alive. And you reflect, if this body

119
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,000
were truly mine. In the same sense, what I said, if the feelings were truly yours, your attitude

120
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,200
would be the first and your feelings would be determined by it. Not your attitude would be

121
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:34,080
determined by the corresponding feeling that has arisen. Means, oh, so my attitude is secondary to

122
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:41,920
this, yet it's acting like it's some sort of commander in chief. So me resisting pain

123
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,000
is my attitude towards the reason pain, which has arisen on its own. So if I were to develop the

124
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,160
attitude of, hold on, that's not a problem. And I stopped gratuitous to resisting it,

125
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,480
you wouldn't be able to suffer. In the same sense, the body gets somebody attached to beat you up

126
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:09,840
physically. That's one thing. But you, through gratuitous assumption of the ownership of that body,

127
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:17,840
that's how you become beaten up and abused. Doesn't matter what type of

128
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,680
assault and abuse it is, the point is it can be done only to the body,

129
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,240
only to the, literally to this bag of, bag of skin filled with lots of other organs and things.

130
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:40,880
And you thinking that you have a say, ultimate say in what befalls that body, well, that was

131
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:49,120
your ignorance from the start. So even if you never get physically abused, you will be abused,

132
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,080
your body will be abused by aging, sickness and death. That's the ultimate abuse. No matter

133
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,920
physical abuse, if it doesn't kill you, can amount for the abuse of death. That is inevitable for

134
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:12,240
everyone. But if you realize that the attitude of abuse comes from you accepting the ownership

135
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,560
of the body that has been abused, and you accept it through wanting pleasure, through it, and you

136
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:26,000
accept it through wanting to get rid of the pain through it. So it comes down again to the

137
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,800
to the feelings that are present. It's unpleasant feeling of abuse.

138
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,520
And you don't even think twice before you start blaming the feeling what happened to the body

139
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:46,640
and everything else. But if you had enough mindfulness and self-reflection, you realized that,

140
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,040
yeah, it's unfortunate, but that's the subject of elements.

141
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:59,040
A form is being deformed by elements, by other bodies, other things. That's just nature of life,

142
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,720
by sickness, aging, death, whatever, accidents, that's the nature of it.

143
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,600
And it was actually my mistake to assume that I had the say in that domain to gratuitously

144
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,200
entertain the attitude of saying no to this, or saying yes, I want more of this, whereby I have

145
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,000
no say in the rising of those things. How can I have a say in prolonging it or not arising in the

146
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:40,800
first place? How can you have a say in not wanting a rising of pain when any attitude towards pain

147
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:52,400
requires pain first? That's why it's unpleasant. That's why you suffer because of the discrepancy,

148
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,160
not because of the pain. Suffering is the discrepancy that your attitude creates in regard to the

149
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:06,400
present feeling. So if the feeling is pleasurable, you suffer when you want more of it. And the

150
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,520
discrepancy there is pleasant feeling and wanting more of it, as in not enough of it. But if you

151
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,920
were to stop wanting more of it, then you're only going to have a pleasant feeling. So there's no

152
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:25,120
discrepancy, no suffering. Consequently, you have the unpleasant feeling present, pain is present,

153
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,720
and you don't want that presence at all, which means you're overdoing it now. There is some pain,

154
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,320
but your attitude does not want any of it. And that's another discrepancy you created it.

155
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,880
Because there is pain. Because there is pain, exactly. If all you had is your attitude towards pain,

156
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,480
you would be in control. But no, there is the actual pain there. And it's your attitude that

157
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:59,440
contradicts it. No, this pain must not be while the pain is. Oh, this pleasure must be greater,

158
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,800
while it isn't. There's a neutral feeling. This neutral feeling, what neutral feeling?

159
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,360
But there is a neutral feeling, but you're not seeing any neutral feeling. That's an

160
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,560
discrepancy. That's why when you're bored, you feel unpleasant. When you're bored,

161
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,240
basically, you feel neither pleasure nor pleasure, but that in itself, it's unpleasant for you.

162
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,800
You want to feel something because a threshold of your discernment of feeling is pain and pleasure.

163
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:37,440
You don't even see the neutral one. And that's why it's unpleasant. So it's a slightly subtle

164
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,960
discrepancy, but nevertheless, it's a discrepancy. Probably you know it's presence. You know neutral.

165
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,520
Then you stop contradicting it. No contradiction, no discrepancy, no discrepancy, no suffering.

166
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,960
Suffering is a discrepancy created when your attitude clashes with the world, basically.

167
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,120
A world can present itself only in three forms, agreeable, disagreeable, and neutral.

168
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,680
And if you deal on that level, you don't have to worry about anything else more particular than that.

169
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:23,280
So how to deal with it in that level? If you take responsibility for what I was being felt,

170
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,680
as in, this is felt by me because of my attitude towards it,

171
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,560
I'm making the feeling affect me, feeling of pleasure, feeling of pain,

172
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:46,160
neutral feeling. So if somebody says something upsetting and the pain arises, that pain

173
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,880
is not in what's being said. It's not in that person. It's not in any of the circumstances.

174
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,760
It's in your attitude in regard to the circumstances.

175
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,520
So you have to take responsibility for suffering, basically. You don't have to take responsibility

176
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,560
for agreeable and disagreeable, but you have to take responsibility for wanting agreeable

177
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,040
and not wanting disagreeable. What do you mean by taking responsibility?

178
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,000
It means seeing that it's on you. There is no excuse. It's my doing. I'm responsible for this.

179
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,640
So when I suffer, I'm responsible for that. Only through that attitude, you can actually

180
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,760
get a glimpse at least and maybe even go through with it. You can figure out how to not suffer.

181
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,800
But for as long as your attitude doesn't take on suffering

182
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,800
as your responsibility and conflates suffering with disagreeable circumstances,

183
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,200
with painful circumstances, you're not going to see the nature of suffering, how can you free yourself

184
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:55,760
from it. So you have to stop blaming painful circumstances for your suffering. Suffering is

185
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:03,920
not pain. So there is pain without suffering, but they cannot be suffering without pain.

186
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,920
So if you remove your attitude of denial and try to get rid of the pain,

187
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:21,760
you won't suffer. If you remove your attitude and indulgent in regard to the pleasure, you won't

188
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,480
suffer. You won't suffer on account of either pleasure or pain or neutrophil.

189
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,840
Well, this attitude is maintained through non-knowing it, through gratuitously,

190
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:46,480
assuming it at face value. And I've heard that. Exactly. Well, that's all you can do. You can't

191
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,120
decide to stop. Okay, now I will stop trying to get rid of the feeling of unpleasure. That's

192
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,040
impossible. But understanding your attitude towards it, that attitude is being gradually

193
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:05,600
cancelled out. I feel pain. I feel pain. Mind jumps to blame the circumstances. You recognize that.

194
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,120
Wait a minute. How many times has this happened? How many times will it happen? Do I have a say

195
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:20,400
in circumstances? No. Why do I then keep sort of like inflaming myself with this attitude of

196
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,400
yeah, this or this or that person? Well, it's just, it just fits the five further. While I kind of

197
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,360
know already that that's not the problem. That's really like indignation and anger and

198
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:42,320
the constant maintenance, the constant action to make it valid. Constant blame. Find the scapegoat

199
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:50,560
for this. Cheers for it. Is that false? Who's going to pay for this? Yeah, there are mistakes

200
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:57,200
and people do things that run wise and they're responsible for that. But if you suffer on account

201
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,160
of it, that responsibility is solely yours. Everybody is sick. Sickness. That kind of pain.

202
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,360
The sickness is true. Yeah, you have to kind of, you know, sort yourself out there. Yeah, that's all

203
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,360
fine. You can be managing the circumstances. But you don't want to be doing it out of trying to

204
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:24,320
get rid of the suffering because that inquires you identifying suffering with disagreeable

205
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,920
circumstances of an alien body. And how do you know whether you're acting out of it or not?

206
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,600
Well, ask yourself, what if I don't take the medicine? What if I don't go and see the doctor?

207
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,640
Am I going to get filled with anxiety and fear in regard to this? Am I going to suffer?

208
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,680
Am I going to experience mental anguish, basically? If the answer is yes, means you are still

209
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,480
conflating suffering with circumstances. Well, you can't just give up the medicines.

210
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,440
No, no. Well, then you realize whether you give up the medicines or not. That's not the problem.

211
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,320
The problem is you confusing your suffering with disagreeable feeling. There has a reason on the

212
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,440
level of an alien body. But you are making it into your mental anguish because of the

213
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,640
gratuitous attitude of trying to get rid of it. So then you can take a step further and reflect.

214
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,040
Okay, so this is the work that needs to be done in order to do their work. I need to stay alive,

215
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:33,440
so I'll take the medicine. That's like properly reflecting. Then you take the medicine as like

216
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,080
a bottle in the time so that you cannot upload the problem. But you don't take the medicine out of

217
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:46,400
that blind sort of just jump into it. I'm sick, fear, deal with it. Okay, and then I'll practice.

218
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,400
You've got to look after your tools. Yeah, of course, of course, exactly.

219
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,360
The bodies are two on a kind of which you can understand the nature of the body,

220
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,560
the nature of not ownership and so on. And for that, you need it. Keep it in a suitable.

221
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,040
So that's what we'll say. He wisely avoids a wild elephant, the one who prays it down. He

222
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,560
wisely avoids a snake, a child called Pitt while a pack of dogs because he would be foolish

223
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,640
before he has completed the work to ignore the fact that this might kill him.

224
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,800
But you don't go around with an attitude of health is good in itself,

225
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,000
as in the health is the greatest value, where you're going to be solely disappointed.

226
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,720
So health is basically a tool. And then you realize, okay, my health's not perfect, but the

227
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:49,280
tool is still good enough. And you can also then realize that you're able to go quite far with

228
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,400
the attitude of it's good enough because it is good enough. And it comes down to what as long

229
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,480
as I'm still alive. And you know, my senses are still there. It's still good enough, even if you

230
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:10,480
are in pain and discomfort. You don't have to go and seek out intense feelings.

231
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,120
No, absolutely not. Of course not. It's going to change my attitude.

232
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,520
Why would you do that? Like if somebody has a thought, where would that action intention be

233
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,960
rooted? Fear of suffering. Right there and then. So you realize, I don't need to go out because

234
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,000
I just now reveal to myself that I'm trying to get rid of the suffering by thinking I'll go out

235
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,640
and do this and this. And that's where you get rid of the suffering, where you recognize your

236
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,520
attitude in regard to the disagreeable feeling, which is always, well, there's a feeling always

237
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:54,160
present. So yeah, so the work is always present. The work is always present in the sense of being

238
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,120
mindful of the attitude towards the present feeling. And in order to be mindful of the present feeling,

239
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,520
you have to stop blaming the circumstances for the arising of that feeling. You have to take

240
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,720
responsibility for it. You have to be you have to feel it basically. You have to allow it to be felt,

241
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,160
but I'm not trying to get rid of it. Mindful of the craving, the attitude.

242
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,800
Well, you can't be mindful of the craving, as I'm craving and craving and craving,

243
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:23,120
you can be mindful of the feeling and then discern the nature of it. Like, well, can I, as I said,

244
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,160
my attitude is always second to this. It's inconceivable to be different.

245
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,320
Once that which you have been prioritized, which you have been prioritizing is seen as second,

246
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:44,000
and it's not a priority anymore. And if that attitude is not a priority, that's how the attitude

247
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,720
starts to fade. So to be mindful of the enduring feeling, you get to discern the nature of the

248
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,240
feeling. That's why mindfulness is the basis of knowledge, or like pain of restraint, saying

249
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,880
no to yourself, saying no to sensual indulgence, saying no to laziness, saying no to your will,

250
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:10,400
acting out of will, it produces pain. Because there's that discrepancy of I want to do this,

251
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:19,280
but you say no. But again, where is that discrepancy really rooted? Is it rooted in you want this and

252
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,560
saying no to it? Or is it rooted in you want this saying no to this? That's experienced

253
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:36,240
disagreeably that you don't want. So circumstances arising, say like a prospect of ill will,

254
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,040
but you restrain yourself as a result of that, you're experiencing this pain now, unpleasant

255
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,840
feeling. That's what you're resisting. So circumstances were not a problem.

256
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:58,320
Even wanting to act out of it wasn't a problem. It became a problem when circumstances, they were

257
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:06,160
unpleasant. You wanted to get rid of the displeasure through affecting the circumstances. That's why

258
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,880
you go and shout, beat people up, threaten them. So they never ever say that to you again.

259
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:20,560
But if you were not affected by the feeling of what's being said, how could you even conceive

260
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,880
act of ill will? And same as we spoke in many other talks sensuality as well. The first

261
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,640
relationship with central prospect of every mind that's universal is pain.

262
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:42,000
That's why sensuality is so intoxicating because it's felt very unpleasantly.

263
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,000
And if you give into it, not just that you avoid that, well, that you cover up that pain,

264
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,120
but you get more pleasure out of it. So it feels like a double pleasure.

265
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,760
But you realize that sensuality is maintained and people go with say, you know,

266
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,080
I'll follow the tastes or sexuality or just just careless indulgence of the senses

267
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:12,880
because it's very painful when the prospect of central indulgence presents itself,

268
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:21,040
it's felt very painfully to not give in. And automatically you blame your attitude of

269
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,400
not giving in for the pain. But you realize, wait a minute, my attitude is a negative attitude.

270
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,800
Like I'm not doing anything. Negative attitude. Negative attitude means sensuality has a reason,

271
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,000
hey, go and eat all these cakes that you want now. That's a thought. So you're not actually

272
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,840
eating the cakes, which means you're still not doing anything. So your response is a negative

273
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,360
response. Not a bad response. Not a bad response in a negative like, oh, it's bad. No, it means

274
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:56,880
it's basically not a positive action. It's a call to a positive action. Go and get these cakes and

275
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,840
eat them and enjoy the sense of taste you get from it. Now, all of that is still your thought

276
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:10,560
and you're not eating it. You're not making any effort. So it's a negative experience. It's

277
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:19,920
absence of these cakes. They will provide me with these great pleasures. And that's the pain of it.

278
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,400
It's because of your attitude that always welcomes greater pleasure from the

279
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,720
currently experienced feeling. So then the prospect of greater pleasure immediately

280
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:40,720
is experienced as that great discrepancy. And then people would give in, go and get all these cakes

281
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,800
and overeat and whatnot, because they want to avoid the pain in the first place.

282
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,640
But can you really avoid as in, can you really prevent the pain in the first place by doing that?

283
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,760
Or can you just covering it up and distract yourself from it? And you realize you can't avoid it.

284
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,000
You realize it by giving in value to the joy that comes out of taste,

285
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,840
treating all these cakes in this example, you gave in the value, you confirmed that you were

286
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,680
affected by it in the first place by that pain of not having that centrality.

287
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:30,080
So as we said before, people think sensuality is unpleasant because they say no to it.

288
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,520
But it's out of the way around. Through saying no to sensuality, you realize that the pain

289
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,680
that you've been attributing to you saying no as in not giving in to the positive action.

290
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,760
The pain of it is basically in that positive action.

291
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,200
So if you want to get rid of sensuality and pain of sensuality and dependence and pressure

292
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,440
and burden and all of it, you just need to stick to saying no to it. And then the nature of it will

293
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,800
become apparent. Because you're not doing anything, you're not doing anything now.

294
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:18,720
And the thought of sensuality comes. But restraint is closer to the natural state you were before.

295
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,120
You were not doing anything. But it's the thought of sensuality that pressures you to go and do it.

296
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,240
And the pain arises on account of that. That's the discrepancy that's been created.

297
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,480
Because you want to do anything before sensuality and you're not doing anything

298
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,360
when you're restraining sensuality. So that's the constant there. What has changed is absence

299
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:51,600
of sensuality before the pain and then presence of sensuality when the pain is there.

300
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,480
So you realize wait a minute. It's the presence or absence of sensuality. Craving for that pleasure,

301
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,200
that's what creates the discrepancy of pain, of suffering on account of sensuality.

302
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,440
Not mighty strain. Mighty strain is more like emulation of the proper behavior,

303
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,960
of the proper action, of the action that doesn't give in to the pressure of sensuality or the

304
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,480
oriole burness on. That's why the restraint, self-composure virtue has to come first.

305
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,040
Because it starts emulating things rightly. You don't know it yet. But on that ground you can get to know it.

306
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:45,120
So inevitably pain is going to be felt when you send out to sensuality and you have to accept it.

307
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,800
Once you accept it, then you can say basically to the pain and to yourself that that pain belongs

308
00:35:52,800 --> 00:36:00,480
to the sensuality, not to the restraint of it. Because as I said restraint, it's no action there.

309
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,720
It's abstaining from action. So you've been abstaining from sensuality when there

310
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,200
was no sensuality pressuring you. Now sensuality is pressuring you. You're practicing restraint.

311
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,320
Again, you're on the same level of abstaining from that action. Yet there is pain. What's different?

312
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,240
It's absence or presence of sensuality. And then it becomes even more apparent. The one thing for

313
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,880
sure, you'll never find peace and like ultimate freedom in the sense of not being pressured by

314
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:41,120
circumstances. If you keep engaging with sensuality, with gratuitous cravings of pleasure through

315
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:51,680
senses, with gratuitous expressions of your ill will through your senses. So whether sensuality

316
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,040
touches you, whether ill will touches you, whether boredom touches you, what they're having common

317
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:07,200
pain. It's a disagreeable experience. Having an attitude of wanting to get rid of disagreeable

318
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,960
means what? In sensuality, how do you get rid of disagreeable by saying yes to it?

319
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,240
In ill will, how do you get rid of the disagreeable by affecting the person or whatever circumstances

320
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,160
by saying yes to it? Exactly. In boredom, how do you get rid of disagreeable by saying yes to it

321
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,280
and finding things to distract yourself from it? Either way, you have a positive attitude

322
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,080
that result in positive actions of indulgence, ill will, distraction, greed, aversion, delusion,

323
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,920
not metaphysical things, they're things that your attitudes are based on, your actions are based on

324
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,200
because of your attitude in regard to how you're feeling.

325
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,400
So from that point of view, that's what I'm going to meant. Whatever it's felt counts as suffering

326
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:08,480
because feeling of agreeable pressures you, feeling of disagreeable pressures you,

327
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:16,640
feeling of mutual pressures you. But again, that pressure is not in the feeling or on the feeling,

328
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,320
that pressure is in your ignorance of it. So you are pressured in regard to pleasure

329
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,120
because you haven't understood it. You are pressured in regard to this pleasure because you haven't

330
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:33,360
understood it. Same goes for the neutral feeling. And that's exactly what I said. If the neutral

331
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,560
feeling is not understood, it's felt unpleasantly, pressure is there. If the neutral feeling is

332
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:50,320
understood, there is no pressure, it's felt pleasantly. So you want sensuality in order to be free from

333
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:58,080
pain. You have ill, will and anger in order to be free from pain. You have distraction, boredom,

334
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:05,520
indolence, laziness in order to be free from pain. Wanting to be free from pain?

335
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,680
If you stop equating that with trying to get rid of this pain,

336
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,440
then you can actually learn how to free yourself from pain, from being affected by pain.

337
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,240
So you will truly be free from pain, not when pain stops arising, but when your attitude

338
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:39,280
to both pain changes. So that's again just to also add to what you said, you don't have to go out

339
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,840
seeking out suffering and pain. Just say no to your desires and the pain is there. You don't

340
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,000
need to go and risk your life and feel threatened and get, you know, that existential dread going.

341
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,520
Just start saying no to your daily sense desires and you'll see how quickly the pain will come

342
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:06,400
knocking on your door. If the attitude is developed towards pain is not a problem, it's my attitude

343
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,600
towards pain that's a problem. Then no amount of pain can prevail over the mind. That's what

344
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:20,000
it will meant for an out of hunt. The disagreeable feelings cannot overwhelm his mind. He is the one

345
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,400
who overwhelms, his mind overwhelms the disagreeable feelings. Well, he is in one who overwhelms his

346
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,960
mind in regard to disagreeable feelings. And that's not just that he needs to do that. It's like

347
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,360
there's some sort of, you know, a determination sort of willpower practice. No, to understanding

348
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:43,680
that's just the natural state of affairs. When disagreeable arises, he has a reason overwhelmed

349
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,120
by the mind that has understood it. Basically understanding overwhelms the disagreeable.

350
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,320
Presence of understanding automatically is higher than disagreeable or agreeable or neutral.

351
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,440
So no, none of those feelings can overwhelm it anymore. Because it's not on the level of just

352
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,680
I'm doing this, it's on the level of this thing, this pain that's there, there is the understanding

353
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:17,120
of that pain that's there simultaneously with that pain. Understanding. You understand what's there?

354
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,840
So that understanding depends on what's there. But whenever that thing is there, it has been

355
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:30,960
understood right there and then because it's there. No, because you theorize about it and

356
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,040
rationalize about it. No, it's because it's there. That's what's been understood. Presence of that

357
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,080
thing, presence of agreeable feeling, presence of disagreeable feeling. And there's just another

358
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:49,280
way of saying there is no more attitude. There is no more assumed, almost entitled, attitude

359
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:57,200
in regard to pleasure, pain, or neutral. So then pleasure feels pleasantly,

360
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:04,080
displeasure feels unpleasantly, and neutral feelings need feels neutrally, and there is no

361
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:23,040
suffering in regard to any.

362
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:35,120
So we started by saying, why is pain a problem? But why am I making a problem out of pain?

363
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:43,520
Same. Why am I making a problem out of pleasure? Well, I'm not making a problem where you are

364
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:52,000
because you are pressured by it. If pleasure is truly not a problem, you wouldn't suffer on a

365
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,200
kind of knot getting enough of it. Whichever shape or form pleasure would arise,

366
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,960
it would be self-sufficient to that extent. It means there would be no craving for more

367
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:14,080
essential pleasure. So you have a thought of, as we said, of going and eating up all the nice

368
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:22,480
sweet cakes. That thought is agreeable. It's nice, nice cakes, nice, nice taste.

369
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:32,160
But that's it. In itself, that's efficient. Why would not that thought pressure you to go and

370
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,600
make all these actions of finding cake, getting cake, eating cake, consuming cake, all of that?

371
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,640
That means you were affected by that pleasure on the level of your thought.

372
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Because you were affected, the only means of you dealing with being pressured and experiencing

373
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,000
disagreeable is seeking out what it sort of points at, at the cake, at the mouth and eating,

374
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,160
shoving cake in your mouth, all that. But all that secondary to the thought of that pleasure of the

375
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,200
taste. But if you were indifferent to the pleasure of the taste on the level of the thought,

376
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,800
committing actions on account of it becomes inconceivable. There doesn't mean that you don't

377
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:27,440
recognize this is a tasty cake and this is not a tasty food. But none of that experience can then

378
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:36,800
almost like facilitate further actions for its own sake. That's why central craving and central

379
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:46,400
pleasure always remains bound with the level of the thought. Because the only reason you'll be

380
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,200
going there and doing this and eating it because the context of the thought of consuming a tasty

381
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,000
food is still there, giving the meaning to all of your individual actions of getting there.

382
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,840
That's why once you go and eat the cake, you never can fulfill that thought. Because thought

383
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,280
is a thought and taste is a taste. It's a completely different sense. But you were assuming this

384
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,160
identity of the whole projection, the whole action. Thoughts of a pleasant taste, consumption of the

385
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,160
pleasant taste, it's identified. But deep down, it isn't and you know that. And that's obvious

386
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,200
to everyone. Everybody will say, people who never read Buddhism, yeah, you know, can't really satisfy

387
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:35,840
your desires, can't you? Because there's nothing to satisfy. There was a pleasure, initial pleasure

388
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:43,040
on the level of the thought. That's it. But it's your attitude that automatically wants more pleasure

389
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:53,200
so you think more about it. That wants more pleasure so you go and do something about it.

390
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:00,080
So again, it's attitude of wanting more pleasure in regard to the thought of pleasure. That's the

391
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:06,240
discrepancy that's been created there. So that attitude is why you suffer. That attitude is why

392
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:24,160
you assume the whole world of sensuality. But if you undo the attitude of automatically wanting

393
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,240
pleasure and automatically not wanting pain, then you have an agreeable thought of

394
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:39,360
some nice, very tasty food or agreeable thought of some beautiful music or agreeable thought

395
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,200
of beautiful sights. That's it. They're just beautiful things that you thought about.

396
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,600
And that agreeability of them stays with them. There is no attitude of you, I want more of this.

397
00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:02,240
And that's why in the thought, they will be only the thought. In the sight, they will be only the

398
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,640
sight. In the sound, you hear something pleasant. That pleasure is confined to that pleasure.

399
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:16,640
Because you don't interfere with it through your attitude of wanting more of it. You don't interfere

400
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,000
with it through your attitude of trying to get rid of it. So in the scene, they've just been

401
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,520
the scene in the herd. They've just been heard the bakhi sutta, the famous bahai sutta.

402
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,160
Now because you got so absorbed in the scene that there's only the scene,

403
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,560
no, it's because in the scene, there can only be the scene. You can't have the something else in

404
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:43,280
the scene. No, if it's there, it's seen. You can't have the herd in the scene or the thought in the scene.

405
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,720
In as much you can't have the scene in the thought. And that's what I'm saying here. That's

406
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:57,120
why sensuality is on the level of the mind. And that's what I said for even for the Tagata,

407
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,440
the beautiful things remain in the world. But it's the desire and lust his thought and desire

408
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,880
and lust that's been perpetuated through it. That's what he has uprooted.

409
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:22,240
So a thought of central pleasure is agreeable on the level of the thought.

410
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,360
And you recognize that is the extent of his gratification, that initial

411
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:40,480
agreeability. That's as much as you can get from him. So if you remove the attitude of

412
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,520
its wanting more of it, you remove any basis for spreading of sensuality.

413
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,920
If there is no spreading of sensuality, sensuality will cease because it requires maintenance.

414
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,040
A vision requires maintenance. Ignorance requires maintenance.

415
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:07,840
Your will, if there is a thought of, I've been offended, he said something rude to me,

416
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:15,440
or all these people might come and kill me. If you're not trying to get rid of the displeasure

417
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,400
of that thought, you won't be affected by anything that happens through that thought.

418
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,200
And you certainly won't be able to engage with anything and wholesome.

419
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,440
That's why you wouldn't be able to kill somebody even in self-defense.

420
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:40,080
You just wouldn't. There's nothing to defend.

421
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:49,520
So why is pain not wanted and why is pleasure wanted?

422
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,120
So it's not about getting rid of the pleasure or having more of it. It's not about getting rid

423
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:03,200
of the pain making it never appear. It's about not wanting one and not trying to get rid of the

424
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,160
other. That's it.

425
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:13,440
Now you can't say, you have a thought, as we said, or eating some tasty food.

426
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,480
And then you're full on chugging food down, down, down your throat, just swallowing it

427
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,640
and saying to yourself, but see, I don't want it on the level of my thought.

428
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,400
That's inconceivable. That's a contradiction in terms.

429
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:35,040
That's why we said it's impossible to engage physically with sensuality without having

430
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,480
central perceptions on the level of thought. You just can't.

431
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,080
Hence the sensory strain, the physical restraint needs to come first.

432
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,800
Because it's based on the wrong discrepancy. So to engage in with it, you're affirming the

433
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,760
discrepancy. If you're affirming the discrepancy, you're affirming suffering. How can you get rid

434
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:25,600
of suffering when you're affirming it through your own very actions?

435
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,920
You're building up on suffering. You take suffering as your temptation.

436
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,040
Yeah, exactly.

437
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,320
Which means any of your efforts can all really pretend to suffering, to undoing of it,

438
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,480
but trying to cover it up.

439
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,600
Trying to get rid of it. But trying to get rid of it is perpetuation of the attitude that

440
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,080
creates the problem. That's where meant your attitude creates the problem and problem perpetuates

441
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,280
once created. But there is no first point where that problem wasn't created and wasn't before.

442
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,720
There's no first point to a vision.

443
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,720
Or you can just think about pain as we started. Because if you remove the attitude of not wanting

444
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,400
pain, you're automatically dealing with sensuality, with pleasure, and with pain, and with your will.

445
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,760
Because you would give in to sensuality because it's unpleasant to not do so.

446
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:39,040
So the way of getting rid of that displeasure is by doing so. But what if you're not affected by

447
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,720
that displeasure in the first place? Can you realize, oh, there's nothing for me to get rid of? There's

448
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,600
nothing for me to get engaged with.

449
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,240
And sensuality is pleasant once you're given in to it.

450
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,640
But you want to look as to why did you have to give in to it? Because it was painful.

451
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:13,440
And everybody knows that.

452
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,840
So that's what we spoke before, like the willpower and so on. That's where you should use willpower.

453
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,240
Not like saying no to everything and overcoming and making it like, you know,

454
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:34,480
prevailing over every single note. Just find things on account of which you suffer,

455
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,240
which is your attitude in regard to pleasure, your attitude in regard to pain,

456
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,960
your attitude in regard to neither pleasure nor pain. And yeah, prevail there, that's it.

457
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,960
You don't have to worry about anything else then. Because whatever you do won't be unwholesome,

458
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,040
because it's not rooted in trying to get rid of pain.

459
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,680
It's not rooted in the discrepancy.

460
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:06,560
Hence, it's our own ignorance and our own actions rooted in it that are perpetuating it,

461
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,440
that is obscuring the nature of things as they actually are.

462
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:20,080
So you remove your discrepant attitude or attitude that results in discrepancy,

463
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:25,040
that creates it, that generates it, then you see the way things are in the scene,

464
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,800
it's just the scene. They never anything, there never was anything more.

465
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,280
They couldn't have been anything more. In the, in the felt, there was just the felt.

466
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,840
In the perceived, there was the perceived. In the intended, there was the intended. Nothing else.

467
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:53,120
In the world, there was just the world.

468
00:54:53,120 --> 00:55:09,520
So in that sense, you can truly learn from your pain, whatever that pain is.

469
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,920
Not through, like, psychologizing and developing some nice pleasing theories,

470
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:23,440
hence, you're learning in very common. No, with presence of pain, you automatically, simultaneously,

471
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,000
must have presence of direct luxurious attitude, unless you're fully enlightened.

472
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,120
So through presence of disagreeable, you have a basis for undoing your attitude towards the

473
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:43,920
disagreeable. Hence, yeah, pain is a great teacher. If done rightly, if you know how to look at it,

474
00:55:43,920 --> 00:56:03,520
if you have a right view because if you know where to look, then all you have to do is

475
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:14,640
practice composure, self-control, restraint, because all these things will be revealing the nature of

476
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,600
feelings that are experienced unpleasantly, will be revealing the displeasure of sensuality,

477
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:28,160
the displeasure will will be revealing it, not creating it. And once you reveal the

478
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:34,160
displeasure that was making you have the attitude towards getting rid of the displeasure, you start

479
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:45,840
to undo the attitude automatically. That work can be in front of you always. Yeah, yeah sure, sure.

480
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,280
It is always, because it's always something felt, which means there's always attitude in

481
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:56,400
regard to whatever's being felt. Sorry, that's the only work that needs to be done. That's the

482
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,200
only work that's the work on the most fundamental level. If you fix things on the most fundamental

483
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,800
level, everything else built on double will be fixed equally. If you purify the stream at its

484
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:13,200
very origin top of the mountain, eventually even the rivers and seas that are being filled by that

485
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:19,440
stream will be purified. But you can be battling and trying to purify the rivers down the mountain

486
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,920
while there is still the source of pollution remains. And that's how, you know, when the

487
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,080
wheel says he purifies his mind from one wholesome thoughts, from thoughts of sensuality. That's

488
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:35,120
exactly how it's done, not by chasing every individual, I was thinking this, what does it mean? I would

489
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:41,200
know. What is the nature of this? Was it rooted in trying to get rid of the pain caused by a

490
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,000
central pleasure, prospect of central pleasure? Was it rooted in trying to get rid of the pain

491
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,160
caused by something disagreeable? Was it trying to get rid of the pain caused by something agreeable?

492
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,080
Was it trying to get rid of the pain caused by neutral? Either way, it's going to be either

493
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:03,680
centrality, ill will or delusion. So he doesn't entertain you on that level. And that's how he

494
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:24,640
purifies his behavior in every other regard.
