1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,240
Well, the same line we were talking about, the hindrances we were speaking about the

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
other day.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:28,080
I think belonging to the body was out, I think they cannot arise without the body.

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:39,760
In separable front, and hindrances have been quite what I had to say, we can add eruptions

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:48,480
of mind, weakness of wisdom and it's always at the first you know, if you can abandon

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,680
those, I don't know if it means to destroy those.

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:01,680
Well, no, I don't fully go beyond hindrance, whereby any hindrance that arises, it's

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,000
not a hindrance for human, because his mind is beyond that, or above them, so they don't.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But it's true.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,040
Well, no, it's not a hindrance there.

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
No.

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,640
Say that the body has moods, both the existence of the five arguments has moods, and that

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,520
mood is taking, is throwing you about, because your mind is somewhere watching in between

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,080
weak and confused in regard to it and appropriating it as mind.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,920
For an arah, it's completely free, free from any appropriation, any conceiving, whatever

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,000
else, they truly remain just bodily moods.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In other words, whatever arises, it won't be a hindrance, and it will never develop to

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,160
the extent that he used to develop, because he used to develop, because he was a hindrance,

19
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,720
because he did take it as mind, and then revolve around it even more, and proliferating

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
it in further.

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,200
She'd go and set moods, or whatever, he will last, and then you just, he would take it

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
out of my mind.

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,800
Well, yeah, and then becomes mind, but like last, for example, it takes a while, like

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:24,040
sexual desire, for example, it takes a while before, it becomes a full-on sexual desire,

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,120
and when I say it takes a while, I mean, it takes some time of attending it wrongly,

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,640
giving attention to the sound of beauty, getting wound up, getting excited, and then, yeah,

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,840
then you can be in that state perpetually, or state of real will, but nevertheless,

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,000
they take time to develop, basically that developing means this kind of revolving, when you

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,160
don't have escape from the initial age of sexual desire, which is purely bodily, because

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,600
for as long as there is a body, for as long as there is a prostate organ and penis and

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:07,880
everything else, there will be a possibility of an age, and that's all third.

32
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,000
Obviously, the whole significance of the sexual organ's centrality and everything else and

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,960
the whole appropriation of that means it's never seen just as an actual sometimes, but

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:24,400
again, even when it is, it's seen as my age, and since there is nothing preventing you

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,200
from stopping it, from not indulging it, people don't understand the danger of it

36
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,880
anymore, they do it, maybe not physically, but it do it mentally, they nurture it, they

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:45,240
cherish it, they entertain it, you give it to, well, yeah, you might be resisting, but

38
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:53,720
let's say a layman, yeah, you pull it, you take on the reins, not just, you go for it,

39
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,600
but it was purely bodily, and he always remains inseparable, imagine if there was no body,

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,560
would you be able to experience sexual desire, imagine if there is no mouth, no tongue, would

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,760
you be able to enjoy the tasty food, you wouldn't, you couldn't, inseparable from, so any

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,040
food that you ever enjoyed, any food that you are enjoying, any food that you will enjoy

43
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:25,480
is completely bound to your tongue, literally, it's completely bodily, because of that, it's

44
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:33,720
entirely bodily, because all the other limitations can happen to come and go, but this remains as

45
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:44,080
a necessary condition, presence of a working time, working eyes, working ears, but that's

46
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,640
not a problem, because if eyes, and what they see would be a problem, if tongue and the

47
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,520
taste would be a problem, removing the tongue would remove the problem, but none of it is

48
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:06,320
the problem, your mind is not a problem, your thoughts are not a problem, so the craving

49
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,480
in regard to it, the assumption of the body is mind, well, they all comes out of it, mind

50
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,600
and conceit and craving, all the walls are on the same thing, ignorance, you can see,

51
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,920
you take it as yours, you're taking me, then you become, you know, that we chase after

52
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,800
the counterpart, so for as long as you are identifying with your masculine body, masculine

53
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,760
sexual order, masculine possibility of sexual pleasure, of sexual pleasure in general, you

54
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,520
will be bound by that pleasure, even if you are Australian, even if you spend your life

55
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,640
as a celibate restraining, if you don't sever the connection internally, you will remain

56
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,840
bound, you will remain essential domain, I mean, just saying no, but you're not, yeah,

57
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,920
you're not actually freeing yourself right, saying no is the first step, but it's the

58
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,840
first step they cannot enable you to see, you escape, no, it's not you escape yourself.

59
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:23,920
Because if I step back in reflection, when I look at the body that appears in whatever

60
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:32,440
form it appears in, it might be a sensation of it, well, if it's a breathing or the,

61
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,280
see, that's already, your body was already there before, because that sensation was being

62
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,600
possible to be manifested because the body was already there, but I don't see it, because

63
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,600
you're not mindful of it, because, and another reason why you don't see it is because,

64
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,840
for you, only that particular manifestation of this or that, the manifest the body is

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,160
the manifestation of the body, but if you develop knowledge that actually, any of those

66
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,120
particular manifestations are possible only because the body is already there, that thought

67
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,600
the body is already there, starts to stand, begins standing for that which is the body

68
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,720
in your experience, in other words, that is your body in your experience, there is no

69
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
between.

70
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,640
The thought that the body is already there, yeah, because again, would you be able to think

71
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,280
anything about the body, if the body is not standing there?

72
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,040
But you can't know it any other way then, well, exactly, you can't access that through

73
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:38,600
the senses, sensation, sensations of touch, sight, sound, smell, that's all sensual, that

74
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:45,440
all comes to senses, and that's usually the criteria of what exists, put in your body

75
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,240
comes to existence much more than that, so, but when you know, all those things are possible

76
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,800
only because the body is already there, and that body is already there, because you're

77
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,360
thinking it, you realize, ah, that's how the mind comes first, because this all precedes

78
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,760
it, that thought of the body preceding them is a real thought, is your body, that is

79
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:21,200
what your body is, at that level, at that time, again, you can go back to the, so the

80
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,800
put on the mindfulness of the bodily portions, you're seated now, your body is in a certain

81
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,640
position, so whether you look at it, whether I'm telling you about it, whether you're touching

82
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:42,640
the chair, that's all because you're seated already, and in a sense that cannot, that the

83
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,200
body is seated, is a thought, but then what else would you expect it to be, because all

84
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,280
of the sight, sound, smell, stasis, touches are known because the manifesting mind are

85
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:05,400
there also thoughts that correspond to respective senses, but sensing itself without the mind

86
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:17,240
is incomprehensible, so thoughts that concern your sight, are thoughts of your sight, or

87
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,640
of your eye organ, if you want to put it like that, that's why there are six different

88
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,960
types of consciousness, there are six different types of thoughts, you can say it like that,

89
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,920
they're different, they all appear to be looking the same, but they're bound to different

90
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:43,880
things thus they're different, thoughts about a smell, or it seems just that, thought

91
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,560
about a smell or thought about a sight, it's a thought, and yeah, there is in common,

92
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,960
they're both thoughts, they're both potential to mind, but they're different thoughts, in

93
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:01,920
the nature, one is bound with the eye organ, another one is bound with the nose, or then,

94
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,720
so a thought of your body being there, mental is bound with the presence of the body, with

95
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:16,480
a six sense base, with the entire thing, so keeping the thought, you're going to even keep

96
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,120
it actually, that's the thing, that's how you develop mindfulness, it's not constant

97
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,240
keeping in your mind, because I was driving mad eventually, it's recognizing the different

98
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,560
layers of that generality, whereby things appear, so you have particular things while you

99
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,200
are seated on the chair, what you're doing, holding something in your hand, listening,

100
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:45,560
talking about all of that while you are being seated, but see if you forget that you

101
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:53,240
are seated, and then you continue on doing things while you are seated, and while I really

102
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,960
lost some mindfulness, but the thing is, you can remember it in a mindful way, they

103
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:08,120
would make your memory mindful, in other words, you might lose the actual awareness of

104
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,240
your eye and seated on this chair, but if halfway through whatever you were doing, you

105
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,680
remember, literally remember, that you are still being seated, and that is the anchor, there

106
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,840
was the anchor of your mindfulness, that memory becomes mindful, so that which you've done

107
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:37,280
in that time span, when you forgot, and I remember, that also is rendered mindful, why?

108
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,640
Because the position of a body thrown in the world, random, existing on its own, given

109
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,640
five aggregates, it's something you can never appropriate actually, yet your whole experience

110
00:11:50,640 --> 00:12:02,040
depends upon it, and mindfulness of body, the postures reveal that, position, body, because

111
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,800
of which I can do, I can think, I can worry, I can be angry, I can be happy, I can be

112
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:13,600
angry, I don't mean because you are seated, because the body is there, seated, standing,

113
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:24,560
walking, lying down, it's just like a little extra reminder of a body in there, and that's

114
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,840
always the, those are always the foundations of your experience, no matter how great, how

115
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,680
lowly, or how depressed, or how lately your experience might be in general, the fact is,

116
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,760
it all requires a body to be there, but I can recognize the posture, yeah, you recognize

117
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,520
the posture, but the thing is, you can't keep it actually in front of you all the time,

118
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,960
because other things will start arising, because that's just how things work, so that's

119
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,080
another point, everybody can, like the person, the people, the touching, touching, walking,

120
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,600
sitting, sitting, they all recognize in the posture, but that's another point, the point

121
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,040
is to recognize it, and then let it go, let it go where everyone wants to go, and as long

122
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,200
as you don't stand up, you hold those mindfulness of the fact that you're seated, so you don't

123
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,200
actually have to be trying to be mindful, you're mindful, but your body is mindful, which

124
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:20,480
is how dead mindfulness can, well, can never lapse, or lapsing with dead mindfulness becomes

125
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,640
less and less occurring, so the other one has the supreme mindfulness, why?

126
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:35,920
Because even when he forgets, that forgetfulness is mindful, because it's in regard to particular

127
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,960
things, but his body is situated there, in one posture, the other, and that's his mindfulness,

128
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:53,000
but the person has to anchor the cells back and back, in the beginning, he was seated,

129
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,320
and then you find yourself, you drift, you drift off, yeah, okay, but I'm still seated,

130
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,720
and I'm still seated, yeah, see, the problem is, with that, people keep over doing it,

131
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,320
because you don't know which is supposed to achieve, so that's why I said, understanding

132
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,280
mindfulness will make you mindful, so you're seated now, and you're mindful that you're

133
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:22,480
seated, and now you're drift off, but at any point, or feel drifted out, I ask you, are

134
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,960
you sitting, are you sitting, or are you seated? You would say yes, so the knowledge of

135
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,680
the body position pertains to the body, and it's there, with the body, so that's why

136
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,720
you can afford to forget it, in that mental keeping it in front of me all the time sense.

137
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:51,760
It's basically recognizing the peripheral, to the extent necessary, that things don't,

138
00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:00,920
to the extent necessary, that forgetting particular things, doesn't induce general non-mindfulness,

139
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:10,560
you can put it like that, so you might have lost a particular thought that I am seated

140
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:18,440
here now, but you are still seated here now, which means, even when you were thinking,

141
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,920
I am seated here now, there wasn't your mindfulness, the fact that you were seated right there

142
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,080
and then, that's where your mindfulness was, it could have been.

143
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:45,880
You see, if I, from time to time, the day I sit down, I do something specific, meditation,

144
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,880
mindfulness, it's a greeting. I say, well, I will, I keep that in mind, I'll be mindful

145
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,880
of my greeting, and I sit there for a while, but then I get up, I think about this, I think

146
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:07,880
about that. Then I might say, I'll be mindful of my body posture, I'll be mindful of my

147
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:17,160
feelings, probably mindful of this, but then am I, I feel that I'm aware of my situation,

148
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,160
my surroundings, the state of my mind, but then I have done, am I actually being mindful

149
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:29,800
of that particular thing? Yeah, because I'm greeting it, because you have to find your

150
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,800
body posture, your breathing, your feelings, whatever you want to be mindful of, you have

151
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:47,120
to find that within that general situation, not in front of it. So in that general situation,

152
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,120
that's how you have to start. Then within that, without abandoning the image of general

153
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,480
situation, you have to start discerning, feeling, you have to start discerning the presence

154
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:07,560
of the body. So this general situation, if I, yeah, I feel like I can, I'm aware of the

155
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:15,880
general situation, but I'm surrounded by it in a way. Yeah, it's in time, yeah.

156
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:28,640
And whatever, I think of as the body within that best dance of the world, pretty much.

157
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:36,000
And ever that can be a number of things, but it will all be inseparable from a body.

158
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:48,960
So ever thought of general situation, if I do have a thought of general situation, is that

159
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:59,400
not making it in front of me? It depends. Well, it's going to be in front of you, it depends

160
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,400
on how you attend it. If you over-attend it, under-attend it, misattend it. If you over-attend

161
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,160
it, it feels like it's behind me. Yes, that's okay. It can fit behind you. But then, if

162
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,000
you over-attend behind me, that can become in front of you. Because must my mind be split.

163
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,560
Well, it doesn't really matter that much actually. What matters is to develop the sense of the

164
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:30,560
mindfulness of wild, the two simultaneous layers, if you want to put it that way.

165
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:43,320
Well, if it is all the bodily and mental, you can put it as crudely as that. But then,

166
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:51,360
obviously, both bodily and mental are mental in a certain way. But there are mental things

167
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,600
that pertain solely to mental and their mental things that are bodily. Thus, mental is

168
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,280
split into bodily and mental. So, in that sense, everything is, your mind comes first,

169
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:11,560
just without the mind, it's in Krasil, but not everything is entirely mental. But even

170
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,360
the whole thing of body and mind will not be able to stand if there is no body that

171
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:23,360
is conscious out there for the end of the minute in the world.

172
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:32,360
What would you say is, is it partly worth the situation?

173
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:43,800
Well, it's, yeah, I suppose, because you have to start from the stage of protugener, so

174
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,080
being contacted, everything is manifested. That would be the original situation. But

175
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,320
recognizing the original situation, you can eventually go through it. Literally, the

176
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,280
discernment through it, you know, left, right, the ball will be right through it, and that's

177
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,800
how you cease to regard it as mind. So, then you're not contacted.

178
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:13,280
But there is two arising. Yeah, so, protugener situation is contact. But situation would

179
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,480
pretend to arise, arising in person the way of the five-year-olds. But if that touches

180
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,480
you, if you make it mind, then you're contacted by it. If it doesn't, then you're not.

181
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:35,280
Then, if the situation, the general situation, you said that, that's what it is.

182
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:45,280
So, I guess, before I forget, I forgot it once, what did you say? You can induce the

183
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,280
mindfulness for general situation, and while you're mindful of the general situation,

184
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:59,280
let your body do things. Walks it, moves about. While you're mindful of the general situation.

185
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Because that indirect way of seeing that body, not directly doing it, but that thing you do,

186
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,280
while you're looking it through the mindful general situation, is one among the bodies,

187
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,280
one among the experience of the bodies. Every mindful of the body.

188
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:24,280
And that's how point of one upon a satin, through doing breath, you do other things through

189
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,280
this thing, which means, there'll never be directly done, there'll be indirect observe

190
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:39,280
while they're done. And what you feel there, what you perceive there, what you do there,

191
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,280
is a feeling, is a perception, is something that's been done.

192
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,280
So, you have to start recognizing that indirectly peripheral is seeing something remotely,

193
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,280
still stands for that thing that you're seeing remotely, not just directly in front of you.

194
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,280
That's how mindfulness develops. So, while you're mindful of the entire situation,

195
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,280
your body's seated there, on its own, almost as if it has its own existence,

196
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,280
independent of you and your general situation. So, to speak, not entirely.

197
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,280
But in a way, yes, because you don't have to be sitting to be seated, you're seated.

198
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,280
But there is something the body does, yet you don't have to keep doing it, same with breathing.

199
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,280
You can be doing the breathing, but the body's also doing the breathing.

200
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:32,280
So, you can be mindful of that breathing as well while you're mindful of the general situation.

201
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,280
So, as if, like, because you're mindful of the general situation,

202
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,280
you can't be fully absorbed 100% into breathing or sitting or whatever else,

203
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,280
and that's the whole point, to not be.

204
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Because then you start recognizing it indirectly peripheral,

205
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,280
which is again, the reason why this whole Vipassana mainstream is completely wrong.

206
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Well, yeah, they believe you can have 100% attention upon the one thing,

207
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
and you can't. That's why the frustration.

208
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I think I'm trying, like I said, your mind has to be split, but I'm trying to give 100% to the birds.

209
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Yeah, exactly. Your mind can be split, and then you can be trying to attend that 100%.

210
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,280
And it's impossible, because of all of the different,

211
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,280
because of peripheral and general and infinity of that structure, you can't have one thing.

212
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Or other that structure is one thing, but you can't step outside of it,

213
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,280
and then attend it as one thing. It's impossible.

214
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,280
You can only see it from within, which means if we're already now mindful of it.

215
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Let me see from a certain general situation, being mindful, being aware of it,

216
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:49,280
and particularly as the body of beings,

217
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:58,280
and then awareness of the mindfulness that's within that situation.

218
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Yeah, as well.

219
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Which is why, if you do it long enough, the belief that you can be outside of that situation will fade.

220
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
And that belief is psychiatry.

221
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Where, by your sense of self, your personality is outside of your experience.

222
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,280
You just assume it, failing to see that that assumption is within this experience.

223
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,280
But if you keep seeing the situation in general, the entire situation,

224
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:36,280
within that, while your mindful situation, in my body, of what you feel or whatever, partially,

225
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,280
because you don't want to be fully absorbed, which you feel, because you forget about the situation,

226
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,280
then becomes apparent that, well, whatever arises within this, will be within this situation.

227
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,280
And if you do it long enough, you stop assuming that there can be anything out of this situation.

228
00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Good evening, your assumption.

229
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Which is how the sense of self is then recognized, but, effortlessly,

230
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,280
and beinglessly within that situation has a phenomenon.

231
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,280
And if it's within that situation, it cannot be the owner of that situation,

232
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,280
it cannot be the creator, it cannot be the master.

233
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:29,280
So, you abandon out the bother like that, which is the belief that your self is far more superior than your whole experience.

234
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Yes, you can see this.

235
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Because if it's manifested, it's impermanent for ever a reason.

236
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
And now you see it manifested.

237
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:55,280
So, if you're mindful of the situation, I'll stop saying, the situation is general, because the situation is general.

238
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,280
So, if you're mindful of the situation, and then within that mindfulness of the situation,

239
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,280
keep a peripheral eye on what your body is doing.

240
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,280
There won't be anything left out, because whatever arise will be between the two.

241
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,280
And that's what we included in it.

242
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,280
And if you get used to that, or rather if you develop it to the insufficient extent,

243
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,280
then you can also see that they're mutually determining each other.

244
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Your entire situation would not be manifested if this random body is still not alive,

245
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:38,280
sitting on the chair and breathing, being nurtured by food over our eyes.

246
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
And vice versa.

247
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:49,280
If there is no situation recognized as such, this body will not be manifested at all within it.

248
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
You can't even mention it.

249
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
You think that's an inconsequential?

250
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Yes, it's inconsequential.

251
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,280
And really, that's the thing, thinking that that's all of the situation.

252
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Yes.

253
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Yes, yes.

254
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:16,280
In terms of the breath, when I say, I tend to the breath,

255
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:23,280
and I try to attend to that, as much as I can.

256
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,280
But I think you wrote it in the comments on meditation.

257
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
You're just sitting now.

258
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:36,280
You allow the body and the feet to arise, by themselves,

259
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:43,280
those feet to merge or arise by themselves, so that you know how long it can see them.

260
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,280
So they know how long it can see, they just arise as they do.

261
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:56,280
You recognize that with the rise, whether you can see them or not, which means my concealing becomes redundant.

262
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,280
So if I'm looking at the, if I'm dreaming, and I'm planning something like that,

263
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:08,280
breathing, breathing, breathing, I mean, I'm looking at the body.

264
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Because the body arises and I look at this body, which I'm not supposed to conceive.

265
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
That's the feeling.

266
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Well, again, you don't conceive it necessarily, just by thinking that.

267
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Because, as I said, well, if you don't want to put something,

268
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,280
mindfulness of breathing is your situation.

269
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
I'm breathing.

270
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
That's your situation.

271
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Within that, I'm breathing while the body is like this.

272
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I'm breathing while the body is like that.

273
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm going to breathe in while the body will be like this.

274
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I'm going to breathe, feeling this, I'm going to be feeling that.

275
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
That's the whole point.

276
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,280
So if you start thinking about a feeling and everything, you can't afford that.

277
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,280
If your mindfulness gets developed to such an extent, whereby an act of breathing,

278
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,280
whether you do it or not, is where it's anchored.

279
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,280
And you are still breathing.

280
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,280
So then when you go back to the breathing, you go back as if it was always there,

281
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
because it was always there.

282
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,280
So you're forgetting, becomes mindful.

283
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Well, rather, you're forgetting, becomes within the mindfulness.

284
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,280
So when you remember, everything is rendered as mindful memory.

285
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Mindful memory means memory that will not injure serigen.

286
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:42,280
We may not ingest it, not...

287
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Well, like, an hour and a half, can remember.

288
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Stuff hit down when he was a pitugian.

289
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:59,280
But none of those memories will lead you to serigen anymore.

290
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,280
So when you forget about the breathing, but then you become mindful of the...

291
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,280
Well, when your body is mindful then, but the breathing is still happening.

292
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,280
Even if you're going to think about other things, when you get back to...

293
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Or rather, let's put it like this, remembering that you were supposed to be breathing,

294
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,280
practicing mindfulness of breathing.

295
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,280
That act won't be like, oh, I remember something I forgot.

296
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Remembering will just mean bringing you back to the breathing that is already there,

297
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,280
and was already there, and was happening all this time.

298
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Thus, your mindfulness was already there, was already there,

299
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,280
and was happening all this time.

300
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,280
So remembering and forgetting, doesn't induce a region anymore

301
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,280
in regard to where was I, what was I going to start again.

302
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,280
He just means coming somewhere else and coming back to the other thing.

303
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Which is what you do all the time.

304
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
But you don't know that.

305
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,280
So when you go somewhere else, you forget.

306
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:26,280
I, the assumptions of a region, everything else, the upper down, they prepared you to do.

307
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Did you give us a start from...

308
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Tell it really, looking at the situation...

309
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Start the pattern, just take any of it.

310
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,280
You can start with any of it.

311
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Here's the body here.

312
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,280
But there are so many different types of practicing body mindfulness.

313
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Looking at dead corpses, is a form of self-pattern.

314
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Why? Because a corpse.

315
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:59,280
A corpse in regard to which you feel no lust, you feel dispassion,

316
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,280
can be conceived without standing for a body.

317
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Mine, body of others, body of both, internal external, internal external.

318
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,280
You can't, because it's entire evolution.

319
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:20,280
So in that sense, would be mindful of the attitude of the expression towards the body.

320
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:30,280
You're mindful of the attitude of the expression towards the nature of the body.

321
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,280
And you can do that by, again, being mindful of the situation while you're looking at a suba.

322
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
So don't go fully looking at a suba.

323
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Like, don't give 100% attention if you forget what you are and what you do.

324
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,280
You're mindful of the situation and then look at a suba.

325
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,280
And keep looking at something you're doing while you're mindful of the situation.

326
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,280
So, peripherally, you are aware of it, but you don't go fully in it.

327
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:09,280
And then, as such, you start recognizing it through that indirect attention,

328
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
which is not.

329
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Well, it's indirect only in relation to what you're used to be.

330
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,280
It's only indirect in relation to that.

331
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,280
But in itself, it's just a different form of attending.

332
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Peripheral attending, without overcommitting, without fully conceiving, without going there.

333
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,280
And that body, that expression that it's manifested at that time,

334
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,280
through that peripheral attending, is one of among the bodies.

335
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
But it's one of among the bodies.

336
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
It doesn't require you.

337
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
It doesn't require mine.

338
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:55,280
It doesn't require me doing it.

339
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Because you're balancing the thing.

340
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,280
Well, it totally did that.

341
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:07,280
So you just start recognizing it without taking it up fully.

342
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,280
And you'll make sure you won't take it up fully,

343
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,280
as long as you remain mindful of the two things.

344
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
The anchor.

345
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
You remain anchored.

346
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
You won't go fully because you're anchored.

347
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
You'll come near it.

348
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
And you can come nearer and nearer and nearer and nearer.

349
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
The stronger your anchor is.

350
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
The moment the anchor breaks, you get in there.

351
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,280
And you forgot about your anchor.

352
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
What about that?

353
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I don't know.

354
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,280
You can look at awareness.

355
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Like awareness.

356
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
That situation.

357
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
More situation.

358
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Well, yeah.

359
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,280
You can say, my awareness, that's basically my situation.

360
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
Yeah.

361
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
Gender awareness without anybody.

362
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
That's my situation.

363
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Obviously, just dwelling in my gender awareness.

364
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Well, that becomes something you actually do.

365
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
And it becomes a particular thing, which means

366
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,280
that the background of it would be something else.

367
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,280
So now, you want to take up situation in regards to something.

368
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,280
In regard to your body, in regard to your feelings,

369
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,280
in regard to your mind for that matter,

370
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
which is almost like situation,

371
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,280
or in regard to the thoughts by the eyes.

372
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Force of the patterns.

373
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,280
So if you become peripherally aware of your body within,

374
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:48,280
that's about within the situation with your mind.

375
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,280
Then even if you forget about your situation,

376
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,280
the fact that that body is still there,

377
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,280
that can become your anchor.

378
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,280
So you get anchored through the anchor.

379
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,280
And that's how mindfulness progresses.

380
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Or expand.

381
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,280
So you take the thing you have with your body.

382
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,280
Well, then yeah, then that body out there,

383
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,280
then that becomes your situation.

384
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,280
Which means, you don't have to do anything.

385
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,280
For as long as your body is just out there,

386
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
your situation is out there, and your mind will,

387
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,280
because it doesn't require any attention.

388
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Because attention means attention,

389
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
which means whenever you attend something,

390
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
there is peripheral.

391
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,280
There is actually peripheral.

392
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,280
Always, even if you give 100%,

393
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,280
which is actually possible, as you can see,

394
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,280
you can't give 100% of your attention to something,

395
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,280
because that would mean you're fully absorbed in that thing.

396
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,280
But there is always a background to whatever you're fully attending.

397
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,280
And that background is always something

398
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,280
that you peripherally aware of.

399
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
That's just how things are ordered,

400
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
that's just the nature of the aggregates.

401
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,280
So when you fully develop that knowledge,

402
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,280
it means you can be fully attending whatever you want,

403
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
your mindfulness cannot last.

404
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Why? Because there is always peripheral.

405
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
And it's fully known.

406
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,280
That's why consciousness is to be understood.

407
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Because that's the direction of consciousness.

408
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Yeah, that's the situation.

409
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,280
So let's see,

410
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,280
what it's abandoning,

411
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,280
the injustices.

412
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
It was in the situation.

413
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
By attending properly,

414
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,280
which is the only somewhere that's properly attention,

415
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,280
being aware of knowledge of birth.

416
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
It means that no matter how raging your body is

417
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,280
in terms of anger or lust or whatever else,

418
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,280
well, now you learn how to see it indirectly.

419
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:11,280
Basically seeing it indirectly means seeing it as not mind.

420
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Yeah, it was a cold cut, kind of.

421
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,280
And you can choose to go into it.

422
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Exactly.

423
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
You know you can.

424
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Unless when you become an anagami,

425
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
and then an anagami,

426
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,280
whereby even the choice of going back into it is fully understood,

427
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,280
that's even going back into it becomes inconceivable.

428
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Of the choices.

429
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
Yeah, you can essentially have it in anger.

430
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,280
But they still have the subtle craving for presence,

431
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
craving for unpleasantness,

432
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
for absence.

433
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Not pleasant.

434
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Is it the self is on the general level?

435
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Well, self is usually where you don't look.

436
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,280
But yeah, self never appears as an object that you can look at.

437
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,280
However, if you learn how to see things peripherally,

438
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,280
then that general sense of self is seen peripherally as such.

439
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,280
And as I said, it's within the situation.

440
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Everything is within the situation.

441
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Eventually it appears in some way.

442
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Well, it always appears in that negative manner.

443
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,280
But the whole peripheral, the whole prospect of the peripheral

444
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,280
is a negative in regard to what you are used to looking in front of you.

445
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Which is positive.

446
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,280
But there is always a degree of negative in regard to everything.

447
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Which is why there is always a degree of self for a position in regard to everything.

448
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,280
But once you start abandoning actual and peripheral,

449
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,280
as mine, then that which was used to be yourself,

450
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
well, those things still keep manifesting.

451
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
But now they are not mine.

452
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Thus there is no more self with mine.

453
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,280
You're not trying to find a self with me.

454
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Well, yeah, you can't find it.

455
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,280
You can discern the phenomenon that's mine.

456
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
That's me.

457
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
That's iron.

458
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,280
Within the general situation.

459
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,280
But that's for another hand.

460
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,280
That just becomes a shape of individual that he is.

461
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Phenological shape.

462
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:41,280
That used to be me, mine, and I was just this individual.

463
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Yes, things keep going.

464
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,280
But things are establishments of mine,

465
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,280
then or something developed

466
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,280
or you can't do it,

467
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,280
while being mindful of the situation,

468
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,280
while having that proper attention of peripheral.

469
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,280
Yes, that's the direction for any establishments of mine.

470
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
You know, so it was whether genres or anything,

471
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
the scene of practice,

472
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,280
it's that through that development and that peripheral.

473
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,280
Because once you got that established,

474
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
then you can establish other things,

475
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,280
other particular things like compassion or whatever,

476
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
kindness.

477
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
I see what you mean, yes,

478
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,280
you can be dwelling in it more particularly.

479
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
You can take it, particularly.

480
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Yes, literally, yeah.

481
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,280
To help undo things more faster.

482
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,280
Because when you are established in the general situation,

483
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,280
you realize, okay, now and beyond,

484
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,280
griefs and joys in regard to the world.

485
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:08,280
When you are in the state of that beyond,

486
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
then well, now I might as well,

487
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,280
since you can't make that body,

488
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
which is not mine, which is already there,

489
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,280
on its own, think things that are good for it,

490
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,280
such as compassion and everything else.

491
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,280
So then when I'm not mindful,

492
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,280
or if I fall back,

493
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,280
perhaps forget to get careless, fall back into the more wholesome environment

494
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,280
that I might poke it again as mine.

495
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,280
And then you keep doing it until eventually,

496
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,280
for an hour out, you can't even fall back anymore.

497
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,280
It's fully developed.

498
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Which is how you can operate and exist,

499
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,280
like every other living being.

500
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,280
And you can't tell the difference externally.

501
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Including the Buddha.

502
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Like this.

503
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Did he?

504
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,280
Something.

505
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Something that people didn't recognize.

506
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Something that people,

507
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,280
they were his followers, like that monk,

508
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
who never met him.

509
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,280
He said, teaching.

510
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Yeah, in the book.

511
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
I mean, they spent that teaching.

512
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
How could he?

513
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
How could anybody,

514
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
show us a Buddha,

515
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
or another, at least,

516
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
with great powers that I can recognize?

517
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
You can't.

518
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Because it's nothing to do with external, anyway.

519
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,280
Or very little.

520
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,280
I saw this whole story about the description of

521
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
how the Buddha's body was.

522
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
Oh, yes, about thirty.

523
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,280
Thirty-two or thirty-six months ago, remember?

524
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Yeah, but it's hard to decipher that,

525
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,280
because he was looking at every Indian religion.

526
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
They have these.

527
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
They have the birth story.

528
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
All sorts.

530
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
But it's irrelevant.

531
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
Yeah.

532
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,280
He liked it to do with anything.

533
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Of significance.

534
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Or the first person the Buddha met upon,

535
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
he's enlightened.

536
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
And he saw,

537
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
oh, wow, this monk, he's quite brave.

538
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
His senses are clear.

539
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Confidently walking.

540
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
He looks like he might be enlightened.

541
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
So he kind of suspected.

542
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,280
He's just got a confident look.

543
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,280
The Buddha was emitting like a green line.

544
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,280
So he asked him,

545
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,280
oh, who's the instruction did you follow?

546
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,280
He said, no one.

547
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
I like it myself.

548
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
I'm fully enlightened by myself.

549
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Nobody's my teacher.

550
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,280
I'm down the Supreme Leader.

551
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,280
And what is my say?

552
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Yeah, right.

553
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
It's so big.

554
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
Like, laughter.

555
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
He may walk off.

556
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,280
It could be true, John.

557
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
And that's where the Buddha really is.

558
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
No.

559
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
If he approaches this.

560
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
Because he could have said,

561
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
yeah, I'm the greatest man in the world.

562
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Because it will be factual.

563
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,280
He's the greatest in like every realm.

564
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,280
Not just this world.

565
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,280
This is the extent of being the Buddha.

566
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
So there was that.

567
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,280
He could have said that.

568
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,280
He wouldn't be alive.

569
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
He wouldn't be conceded.

570
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,280
He wouldn't be nothing like that.

571
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,280
But because everybody else is clouded by their conceit.

572
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,280
They could have not possibly seen it as anything other than conceded.

573
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,280
Which is exactly what it's meant.

574
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
Oh, really?

575
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,280
I was so big, my friend.

576
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
And walked off.

577
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,280
So then the Buddha reaffirmed.

578
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,280
He said, well, maybe if I approach it something

579
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,280
that they can all relate to.

580
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Which is suffering.

581
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,280
Have freedom.

582
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:37,280
Because when he went there for disciples, when they asked him,

583
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:47,280
again, they saw,

584
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,280
he looks like he might be alive.

585
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,280
He was very confident in the way he moves and so on.

586
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,280
So they,

587
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,280
all who is instruction that you follow.

588
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
But he just said, well, there is suffering.

589
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,280
Who is suffering?

590
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
No, there is suffering.

591
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,280
He just refused.

592
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
I don't know.

593
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Just let someone talk for months.

594
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,280
Stop asking those questions.

595
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,280
Have you ever heard me speak?

596
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,280
There's nobody else.

597
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,280
Well, then be quiet.

598
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:24,280
Thank you.
