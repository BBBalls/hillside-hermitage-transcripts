00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
I was here a few days ago listening to your Yamato, and now I try to break this, but

00:07.760 --> 00:18.280
actually I struggle to apply, to seeing the context of the situation that pay for a background

00:18.280 --> 00:19.280
to speak.

00:19.280 --> 00:27.280
It seems to me that what I do is like when I really remember the present moment, some kind

00:27.280 --> 00:32.800
of impression, or so, whatever, thinking myself in the present, and then I try to

00:32.800 --> 00:38.640
further into the context, but it seems more like intellectual exercise, like thinking

00:38.640 --> 00:43.160
or talking to myself, okay, so I mean the situation, it is this problem which is given

00:43.160 --> 00:51.120
to me, and talking like this, and I'm not sure that this is actually what I'm supposed

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
to do.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.120
Can you speak a little bit about this?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.120
Sure.

00:55.120 --> 01:04.640
If something is abstract or intellectual, that is determined by your attitude.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.360
Your attitude determines whether it's going to be abstracted from the present experience

01:08.360 --> 01:14.520
or not, so if you know how to look properly, then nothing is abstract, then even turns

01:14.520 --> 01:18.240
like the infinite space and either perception or perception becomes state that mind can

01:18.240 --> 01:23.440
get established upon, because it's not divorced from it, I developed the knowledge of them

01:23.440 --> 01:25.720
so you can get established in them.

01:25.720 --> 01:30.200
But yeah, for somebody who's absolutely no concept, no recognition of it, it will remain

01:30.200 --> 01:32.200
abstract.

01:32.200 --> 01:38.760
So the point, like in simpler terms, for what you're trying to do, well first of all,

01:38.760 --> 01:44.880
as I said, you can't force the background as a foreground, because I mean something

01:44.880 --> 01:46.480
else is the background.

01:46.480 --> 01:51.720
So you can only just recognize whatever is the foreground at a time, and then while

01:51.720 --> 01:56.800
the foreground is present, simultaneously with the present foreground, you start discerning

01:56.800 --> 02:03.320
the background very fairly, in regard to that foreground, but not over-intending the

02:03.320 --> 02:05.320
background.

02:05.320 --> 02:09.880
Not looking at the background directly, because then that becomes foreground, you just

02:09.880 --> 02:14.440
attended it, which means then something else is very far out to your attention.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.360
That's why it's so hard, because you can't attend both ends simultaneously, that will

02:18.360 --> 02:20.600
require you to step away from them.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.440
You can only attend one while the other is present.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.320
That's why Nama Rupa returns to Vinyana when you look at Vinyana, when you look at Vinyana,

02:26.320 --> 02:28.320
returns to Nama Rupa if you look at Nama Rupa.

02:28.320 --> 02:32.600
You can't look at them both and see them, yes, none of this is mine.

02:32.600 --> 02:38.440
So you can only learn while you're looking at Nama Rupa, for example, to discern the presence

02:38.440 --> 02:44.240
of Vinyana in this sense, or just discern the background, without stopping, without

02:44.240 --> 02:49.240
ceasing to look at Nama Rupa or whatever you're chosen to look at the time.

02:49.240 --> 02:54.200
And that's how you develop knowledge about the peripheral, knowledge that that too is

02:54.200 --> 02:57.800
determined by the foreground I'm looking in as much as the foreground is determined by

02:57.800 --> 03:02.880
the background that is being generated by it, but you can't look at it to the same extent

03:02.880 --> 03:08.320
and compare it to and say, okay, these both are mine, not self and so on and so forth.

03:08.320 --> 03:15.600
So that's why it's so hard to, that's why it has to be repeated, on and on and on and

03:15.600 --> 03:20.720
it's not like you're figuring it out intellectually, nor is it some sort of a mystical experience

03:20.720 --> 03:22.720
where you just wait for some revelation.

03:22.720 --> 03:27.600
It's just a mental drill, whereby you lock your mind literally to like a standstill for

03:27.600 --> 03:31.160
a second, for a two, and you keep doing it, and you keep doing it, and you keep doing

03:31.160 --> 03:35.600
it, until you start discerning, right, what's there in front of you?

03:35.600 --> 03:40.200
But what you just said was that you're afraid you might become intellectual and sort of

03:40.200 --> 03:44.680
not really, that's probably true in your case, because what, only three days ago you heard

03:44.680 --> 03:49.560
about it, so you're going to take time to worry about, however, even if you're talking

03:49.560 --> 03:55.160
to yourself, so to speak, it is slightly a crude manner of maintaining your mindfulness,

03:55.160 --> 03:59.080
but you wouldn't be able to talk about things if they're not there.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.080
I see.

04:00.080 --> 04:04.880
So even you're talking to yourself is actually generated from the present situation, things

04:04.880 --> 04:06.280
you're talking about.

04:06.280 --> 04:11.520
So it's only a right that you then, that makes it kind of divorced from being remaining

04:11.520 --> 04:13.960
rooted in the present situation.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.840
So if you start talking to yourself present, you become mindful of what you're doing,

04:18.840 --> 04:23.000
talking to yourself about these things, and you're not, and again, it's important to

04:23.000 --> 04:30.560
say, it's important to stop expecting to find some sort of hidden kind of blitz of a

04:30.560 --> 04:35.280
kind moment, oh yeah, I saw it, which is why people often expect that, well, they actually

04:35.280 --> 04:40.480
take time to shake that off, because everything points at something like that, every meditation

04:40.480 --> 04:45.080
technique, every practice, it's something you're going to see, no, it's not about seeing

04:45.080 --> 04:47.520
it, it's about doing it.

04:47.520 --> 04:52.280
And what you're doing apparently doesn't seem to have any result.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.960
That's why people can't achieve it by accident.

04:56.960 --> 05:02.120
That's why people can't develop their mind accidentally, because you might do it once

05:02.120 --> 05:07.240
accidentally, or twice accidentally, or five times accidentally, but you see no apparent

05:07.240 --> 05:13.160
verification, the putusion of what recognizes something worth pursuing, so you just think

05:13.160 --> 05:18.600
of seeable that you would stick to it and keep repeating it all and all and all, unless

05:18.600 --> 05:22.280
somebody a faith in tells you to do it.

05:22.280 --> 05:27.320
And then you repeat it and you repeat nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

05:27.320 --> 05:31.280
And then you look back and you realize, oh, actually, it's not nothing anymore.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.080
My mind has changed.

05:33.080 --> 05:37.760
And that's the similar that I've handled, how the work, the carpenter doesn't know how

05:37.760 --> 05:44.280
much it has been wasted, but you just keep using it until it thins out, so just keep going.

05:44.280 --> 05:48.240
You have to keep going and you have to keep in track with the patience, that kind of

05:48.240 --> 05:53.160
expectation to, oh, I got it now, I had it, I had it for, I had it like for this second,

05:53.160 --> 05:54.160
I did.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.880
No, because the background remains, you just want to train how to start discerning it

05:57.880 --> 06:01.320
as background, yes.

06:01.320 --> 06:05.840
And if you start discerning it as background, as I said, you don't even need all these

06:05.840 --> 06:10.560
suitors that we have, you'll need very few, and things will become clearer, because you

06:10.560 --> 06:13.520
now have a basis for discerning it.

06:13.520 --> 06:18.560
But if you pair, or that effort of discerning the background eye, effort of properly developing

06:18.560 --> 06:25.160
mindfulness, if you pair that with bleeding the suitors and try investigating the meaning,

06:25.160 --> 06:29.160
bleeding in the mirror, things like that that will make you think about it, then yeah,

06:29.160 --> 06:31.880
you are basically making quite a problem.

06:31.880 --> 06:37.280
Yes, I think you are nicely basically summarized the whole thing, yeah, that's what happened

06:37.280 --> 06:45.120
to me that I was, you know, because it's something, you know, I was really expecting some unusual

06:45.120 --> 06:47.480
things happening.

06:47.480 --> 06:56.720
And, but Asric has said, it's kind of talking to myself and bringing it, am I not actually

06:56.720 --> 06:58.560
bringing it to foreground?

06:58.560 --> 07:02.800
Well, you are, that's the thing, so you might sort of talk to yourself as kind of picking

07:02.800 --> 07:07.560
it up, but then you don't need to keep talking to yourself if it's still up.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.320
That's when the suitors, when the monks who tried to understand something, they were kind

07:10.320 --> 07:15.920
of, they say it's loud twice, so he's like, oh, first jauna, first jauna, what is first

07:15.920 --> 07:16.920
jauna?

07:16.920 --> 07:21.200
So they bring their mind kind of through that, after and through that designation, and

07:21.200 --> 07:24.440
then the mind starts thinking about it, they don't keep saying, what's the first jauna,

07:24.440 --> 07:27.280
what's the first jauna, what's the first jauna, what's the first jauna, because the mind

07:27.280 --> 07:31.760
is directed, just like you're directed, and then you push it, so you obviously, that's

07:31.760 --> 07:35.200
possible for somebody who's the other mind to that extent, then he can actually contemplate

07:35.200 --> 07:38.200
on the basis of mindfulness.

07:38.200 --> 07:45.320
So that's why it's sort of a practice really that's, as I said before, it's about doing

07:45.320 --> 07:53.760
it, and that's again important to repeat, because if you focus on actually just repetition

07:53.760 --> 07:59.600
and developing the attitude, then the content of the experience becomes secondary, it

07:59.600 --> 08:05.640
comes irrelevant, then even if you have something, some lofty sort of sublime new experience,

08:05.640 --> 08:10.600
now you're not fooled by it, you're not taken by it, you're not overwhelmed by it.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.600
Why?

08:11.600 --> 08:15.320
Because whether it's a lofty experience, whether it's low, whether it's mundane, whether

08:15.320 --> 08:21.040
it's upper mundane, whether it's normal, whether it's a novelty kind of rare experience,

08:21.040 --> 08:22.040
experience is there.

08:22.040 --> 08:27.440
It doesn't matter what it is, which means you stop being concerned with your content,

08:27.440 --> 08:31.480
which means you can't create those things, you can't create the nature or experience

08:31.480 --> 08:35.600
is present, it's kind of indifferent, it's neutral, and that's how you also overcome

08:35.600 --> 08:41.800
any mystical attitudes for any sort of mystical, pleasurable revelations and so on.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.760
The revelations you get are revelations of your insight that are based upon efforts to

08:45.760 --> 08:49.120
understand and understanding being developed.

08:49.120 --> 08:55.280
I think it's very nice to summarize because I was basically doing all these years, I was

08:55.280 --> 09:00.360
just being caught up in experience, it never somehow influenced reading these sutas or

09:00.360 --> 09:05.840
whatever, it never of, you know, and it's there actually, but it never occurred to me

09:05.840 --> 09:08.800
actually to look on the structure of experience.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.680
Because structure of the experience is nothing other than the same nature of experience.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
Yes.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.320
And actually the Buddha said himself, that's what he called the whole teaching, he called

09:16.320 --> 09:22.200
Dhamma in the same, using the same word, he uses for nature of particular things.

09:22.200 --> 09:26.680
So it's Dhamma, Dhamma, with capital D, it's nothing other.

09:26.680 --> 09:34.000
So then I'll understand what you are talking about, basically the past cannot be found

09:34.000 --> 09:35.600
in the experience.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.640
No, exactly, it's in regard to it.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.640
Yes.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.040
Yeah, it's by understanding the nature of that which appears, the nature of the fact,

09:43.040 --> 09:46.720
and it's in others that I mean in many sutas, it's said by understanding the nature of

09:46.720 --> 09:47.720
the five aggregates.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.720
Yes.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.720
There is no room for upadana anymore.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.720
Yes.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.720
You stop holding them.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.720
That's what it is.

09:52.720 --> 09:53.720
But it really never...

09:53.720 --> 09:58.880
Well, yes, as you can see, it is simple, once you kind of get the notion of it, it's

09:58.880 --> 10:04.000
like, of course, it's not complex, it's not elaborate intellectually, it's very, very

10:04.000 --> 10:09.880
concise and very direct, but unless you see it, you won't see it why, because even if

10:09.880 --> 10:14.560
somebody talks about it, general about the nature, saying nature of experience is peripheral

10:14.560 --> 10:16.840
of experience, it's nothing else.

10:16.840 --> 10:21.840
But even if somebody talks about it, if a person doesn't have the attention they can

10:21.840 --> 10:27.400
span to the actual and peripheral, simultaneously present, I, if he doesn't have the only some

10:27.400 --> 10:32.200
monocicura, the one they can include it, you'll be just seeing is another method, is another

10:32.200 --> 10:37.360
thing, is another technique, is another foreground thing that he cannot hear to mechanically

10:37.360 --> 10:39.440
and it will lead into results, he won't.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.440
Yes, he won't.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.600
So, you can kind of close the right instructions, but he won't read them rightly, he won't

10:44.600 --> 10:49.560
understand them rightly, because he doesn't have, his mind doesn't have this span to recognize

10:49.560 --> 10:53.640
that instruction applies simultaneously, but at different layers.

10:53.640 --> 10:58.600
Yeah, yeah, you know me, I know you have two years or a day, so we already have two

10:58.600 --> 10:59.600
discussions.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:00.600 --> 11:05.760
But just you listen, go actually, I just go at least, let's say slightly what you are

11:05.760 --> 11:08.080
talking about before it relates.

11:08.080 --> 11:12.760
In the whole, but it's no bother, for example, it first, exactly to that, to that simultaneous

11:12.760 --> 11:18.640
presence of the two different sort of things in your experience, not to the same extent,

11:18.640 --> 11:22.040
but the simultaneously present, one is foreground, one is better, now I'm looking at all of

11:22.040 --> 11:26.680
the other, so it doesn't matter what a content of the foreground is, nor what a content

11:26.680 --> 11:31.440
of the peripheral is, is nature of it, that's what the structure is, that's what it's

11:31.440 --> 11:32.440
no bother.

11:32.440 --> 11:36.720
So, you're going with it, with the grain of that nature, you go how it pushes you, you

11:36.720 --> 11:41.600
go with the grain of Patissom Father, means ignorance is being maintained.

11:41.600 --> 11:47.800
You go against that simultaneous sort of principle of that simultaneously present nature, you

11:47.800 --> 11:53.960
go against Patissom Father, means ignorance is not generated anymore, so it's not, you

11:53.960 --> 12:00.320
know, the content is relevant in a secondary sense initially, in terms of abstaining from

12:00.320 --> 12:08.240
a wholesome content, an also engagement, things based on sensuality, ill will, but that's

12:08.240 --> 12:13.120
just so that you can actually see through the nature of the content and then stop being

12:13.120 --> 12:18.360
conservative, that's how our anger goes beyond good and bad, how people often like to

12:18.360 --> 12:26.280
say, but so in that sense, you can transcend, you can sort of overcome any influence content

12:26.280 --> 12:37.640
that can have over you, by understanding the nature of that, which contains that content.

12:37.640 --> 12:44.400
So you just have to be sort of patient and really, keep sort of finding energy to do it, because

12:44.400 --> 12:50.120
as I said, it's not, you know, you won't get any novelty sort of release energy, what

12:50.120 --> 12:55.120
not, I don't know what people nowadays on the retreats, because it's really onto you

12:55.120 --> 13:02.000
to develop it, and initially seemingly there is absolutely no, so that's why faith needs

13:02.000 --> 13:08.520
to come first, you have faith that that's right, you try to also kind of supplement that

13:08.520 --> 13:12.520
faith with any sort of intellectual clarity and understanding you can get in regard to

13:12.520 --> 13:18.160
the message that you're supposed to be applying, and then you just keep doing it, keep doing

13:18.160 --> 13:20.360
it and keep doing it and keep doing it.

13:20.360 --> 13:25.960
But still, you can basically do your formal meditation, it's just about this little approach.

13:25.960 --> 13:26.960
Yeah, sure.

13:26.960 --> 13:34.080
Just can you say, Pihika, Ana Pana, Satya, or Nuts of the Bodhi, in regards to that, like

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
this and that.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.080
Sure, sure.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.080
Yeah, that's fun.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.080
That's fun.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.080
Because basically, you just, all you need to do is something that's not to distracting.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.080
Yes.

13:42.080 --> 13:46.080
When you're walking up and down, but you just go for a walk, or following the alaqa, obviously,

13:46.080 --> 13:51.520
you know, here you might be more concerned after a lot to look up for, but say like in

13:51.520 --> 13:56.200
England, you could just go on those country lanes for a walk, you don't think about where

13:56.200 --> 14:00.280
you're stepping in that sense, and then you can just fully commit to the reputation of

14:00.280 --> 14:01.280
that contemplation.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.000
Because you remain in the present moment of the bodhi, everything is already there, given

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
for you.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Yes.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.880
I think you need to work with, so you don't need to be sort of fabricating on top of

14:09.880 --> 14:14.200
it and giving priority to some sort of focusing methods and things like that.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.920
It's actually, as you can see, focusing works on particularizing whatever has a reason.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.440
You don't want that.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.720
You want to learn how to, like, see the general in regard to whatever it's already

14:24.720 --> 14:25.720
particular.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.720
Yes.

14:26.720 --> 14:27.720
So you basically go opposite way.

14:27.720 --> 14:31.560
You don't want to be caught up in the experience and be completely lost.

14:31.560 --> 14:36.800
Whether you have pain in your knees, weird sensations in your back, itchy elbows, what

14:36.800 --> 14:38.760
is in common to all of those things?

14:38.760 --> 14:40.480
The bodhi is there.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.480
You recognize that.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.480
And that's a thought.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.160
It's nothing other than a thought.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.160
Yes.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.160
It's a mental image.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.160
Yes.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.320
But if a mental image, if you're mindful of it, it will stand for that big bodhi is in

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
your present experience.

14:51.320 --> 14:55.440
If you lose mindfulness, it becomes an abstract thought of your body.

14:55.440 --> 14:58.480
And then you need to kind of reconnect it to your mind.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.640
No, you just need to be mindful of it again.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.280
And it will sort of re-emerge as that which your body is.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.880
Because you can't know anything without a mental image in your mind.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.880
Yes.

15:07.880 --> 15:08.880
It's ritual.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.080
It's, like, you can't even talk about something that will not exist without, because that's

15:12.080 --> 15:13.080
already a mental image.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.080
Yes.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.080
A phenomena.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.080
Yes.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.040
So that's where you have to start recognizing things.

15:18.040 --> 15:23.760
Not kind of following weird sort of itchiness and sensations in your body, because that kind

15:23.760 --> 15:27.000
of seems like a solution because you actually forget about a problem.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Exactly.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Exactly.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Exactly.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Exactly.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.240
And the thing is, sooner or later, depending on how much effort you put in, you're going

15:35.240 --> 15:39.840
to get used to it in a particular way of looking at things that are focusing and then

15:39.840 --> 15:44.960
novelty and the release of that novelty kind of a new thing, it's a new discovery, it's

15:44.960 --> 15:45.960
going to fail.

15:45.960 --> 15:46.960
Yes.

15:46.960 --> 15:51.240
So then you need to do it harder or find something else, or go on a longer retreat, or become

15:51.240 --> 15:56.080
even stricter, be personal, practitioner or whatnot, just to intensify further or more.

15:56.080 --> 16:00.200
But you just keep going further and further and further in that wrong direction.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.200
Yes.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.680
This is an infrastructure.

16:02.680 --> 16:07.240
And that's how in the soup, as you can have somebody understand, just even without any

16:07.240 --> 16:10.680
of that, just by his word, because understanding is in that general level.

16:10.680 --> 16:15.040
So if he understands things right, he leads to the nature, he might not necessarily be

16:15.040 --> 16:20.440
mindful, obviously he's had a mindfulness for some degree, for the mind to remain present

16:20.440 --> 16:26.160
and compose, some sort of somebody, for him to see things clearly through that understanding

16:26.160 --> 16:27.160
and through that instruction.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.320
So that's where the somethings they would just discuss, the Dharma and mind would end

16:30.320 --> 16:35.000
with somebody based on the discussion, based on some sort of, you know, sharing of the

16:35.000 --> 16:38.800
mutual energy that's kind of passes from me to you, you know, just understanding the

16:38.800 --> 16:44.000
same setup, the same structure, the results in mind, reaching in equilibrium.

16:44.000 --> 16:54.840
So can we still define mindfulness as a values of the present or among the experience?

16:54.840 --> 17:00.480
Yes, but mindfulness sort of should allow a degree of forgetfulness as well, of the present

17:00.480 --> 17:01.480
moment.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.280
So it's not just like a constant and present, and present, and present, and present,

17:04.280 --> 17:08.320
because whether you do a present, even when you're forgetting is in the present moment.

17:08.320 --> 17:14.760
So you want to discern that, that's how mindfulness becomes unshakable, whereby when you forget

17:14.760 --> 17:20.120
things and come back from it, the base is, it remains unaffected, because whether you

17:20.120 --> 17:23.840
forget, you forget in the present moment, whether you think about the past, you think in

17:23.840 --> 17:27.480
the present moment, where you plan about the future, you plan in the present moment.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.880
So actually, it's not optional for you, you are stuck in the present moment.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.880
Yes.

17:31.880 --> 17:35.720
So the definition of that, but people don't recognize that they try to fabricate it with

17:35.720 --> 17:39.720
a effort and with a forceful attention, a present, a present, a present, a present, one,

17:39.720 --> 17:43.040
two, three, four, five, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, one, two, no.

17:43.040 --> 17:48.280
Your present means things are already enduring, so it's the discerning of those three characteristics,

17:48.280 --> 17:52.640
rising in mindfulness, sitting in mindfulness, position of changing in mindfulness, mindfulness

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
is established.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.640
Yes, absolutely.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.000
No, by active effort, because you're already there, your effort is done present here.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Yes.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.800
Whether I want or not I'm in the present moment, fully understanding that, that cannot be,

18:05.800 --> 18:10.760
that cannot be disturbed, even when you, when you forget about things.

18:10.760 --> 18:15.800
And then when forgetting and remembering, ceases to sort of induce ignorance in a sense

18:15.800 --> 18:21.240
of you forget the things in you, you forget, that you are not a center of experience,

18:21.240 --> 18:25.120
you forget the things don't really need you for they're operating, the five-hour-day

18:25.120 --> 18:31.200
things exist, what, without you really, if you forget those things, then when you remember

18:31.200 --> 18:35.000
you remember with yourself, you remember with your craving, you remember with your conceit.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.480
So that's why the mindfulness needs to be developed to the extent necessary.

18:38.480 --> 18:43.520
So the knowledge of forgetfulness and non-forgetfulness needs to be developed to the extent necessary

18:43.520 --> 18:47.880
to include both, so the neither will induce the confusion from beforehand.

18:47.880 --> 18:48.880
Yes.

18:48.880 --> 18:49.880
Yes.

18:49.880 --> 18:59.320
So also it seems that basically thinking or thought is just, it can be used as another,

18:59.320 --> 19:00.320
let's say, object.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.320
Absolutely.

19:01.320 --> 19:05.080
You know, it's in the same, but still seems to mean that the body is actually better.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.080
Well, you have to start.

19:06.080 --> 19:10.960
I think starting with the mind will be too, too hard, you know, as the Buddha said, to

19:10.960 --> 19:17.000
general can, you know, understand the nature of the body and even this, remove any passion

19:17.000 --> 19:21.080
in regards to it, but understand the impermanence of the mind and so on, it's too hard, because

19:21.080 --> 19:22.400
it moves too quickly.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.080
But it's the same principle, it's the same nature.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.080
Yes.

19:26.080 --> 19:30.000
So you don't want to start with the body because energies are hidden in the body and

19:30.000 --> 19:32.880
you're going to release some trapped ignorance that's somewhere in the body.

19:32.880 --> 19:37.560
No, you start just because it's easier to see, but you do extrapolate the same principle

19:37.560 --> 19:41.720
and start applying it to your thoughts, because ultimately it's the thoughts actually.

19:41.720 --> 19:46.680
If you want to deal with something, they will deal with both your mind and your body,

19:46.680 --> 19:49.600
you need to deal with your thoughts, but it's too hard.

19:49.600 --> 19:53.600
So you begin with the obvious thoughts of your body, so that you can start seeing the

19:53.600 --> 19:56.080
nature of thoughts.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.880
So then thoughts of your mind, thoughts in the mind, thoughts that are not necessarily

19:59.880 --> 20:04.080
concerned with the body, that can also be included through understanding the same nature

20:04.080 --> 20:05.480
of a thought.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.480
Yes.

20:06.480 --> 20:12.360
And do you have access to body always through the mind?

20:12.360 --> 20:18.640
So yes, that's not the question kind of already implies a certain answer.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
The body is there.

20:19.640 --> 20:26.160
The only way you can have the experience of the body is because of the mind, which means

20:26.160 --> 20:29.400
the mind is then cannot be separated from the body.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.400
Yes.

20:30.400 --> 20:34.360
But the body, when you can't even say the body, if the mind is not already there, so in

20:34.360 --> 20:39.400
that sense the mind comes first, it defines it, it designates it, yet if there is nothing

20:39.400 --> 20:43.200
there, the mind would not be able to designate anything.

20:43.200 --> 20:49.400
That's why there is the form rupa that is necessary for the whole presence of nama and

20:49.400 --> 20:50.400
that designation.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.400
Yes.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.400
So there needs what?

20:52.400 --> 20:53.400
There needs…

20:53.400 --> 20:54.400
Yes.

20:54.400 --> 20:58.040
The problem is now, I see when I said there is rupa, when you think that thought there

20:58.040 --> 21:02.720
is rupa, you think that's the actual rupa, but no, that's just another nama in regard

21:02.720 --> 21:06.800
to that, because of which that nama is there.

21:06.800 --> 21:07.800
Yes.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.240
So you have… that's how you start conceiving the rupa in the experience, when the thoughts

21:12.240 --> 21:15.840
in regard to rupa are regarded as that which rupa is.

21:15.840 --> 21:21.000
So if you experience rupa, if you experience body, it's not the body.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.240
Well, no, you know that's a problem already, now you're denying rupa, which is another

21:25.240 --> 21:27.400
form of affirming it.

21:27.400 --> 21:33.600
Like basically he conceives form, he conceives in form, he conceives apart from, no, it's

21:33.600 --> 21:37.440
not the body, it's the body, it's not the body, it's both the body and not the body,

21:37.440 --> 21:42.560
it's neither body nor not the body, either way he keeps referring to the body, which he

21:42.560 --> 21:47.480
still means, means basically still assumes that he can relate to that which body is eye,

21:47.480 --> 21:52.040
he can relate to that rupa, but thinking that you can relate to that rupa, you already

21:52.040 --> 21:53.800
conceived it as relatable.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.280
So you must visit it very thoroughly, what you are talking about.

21:57.280 --> 22:01.800
Exactly, you can't get it in a moment, because that's already the product of your conceiving

22:01.800 --> 22:02.800
or misconceiving.

22:02.800 --> 22:08.760
So you need to understand the peripheralism whereby in thinking there is just thinking, in

22:08.760 --> 22:13.440
seeing there is just seeing in her, there is just her eye, there is not too much or too

22:13.440 --> 22:18.120
little of it, there is not given to the rupa or taking away from it, it's just fully understood

22:18.120 --> 22:25.080
that this thought stands upon the basis that rupa is, but even that thought does not for

22:25.080 --> 22:30.440
you induce assumption that that's what that rupa is, because that one, basically that would

22:30.440 --> 22:35.560
be overshooting the mark, there will be like you accessing that which you cannot access.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.320
And by not knowing that you cannot access, you access it, and that's how you maintain

22:39.320 --> 22:43.600
its existence, that's how a rupa finds a footing in your experience, you create it, you

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
give it, you maintain it.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.600
Very good, very good.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.600
But I'm glad it's clear.

22:47.600 --> 22:57.600
And what I have, another thing, you know, I lost the, you know, I lost the, I lost the

22:57.600 --> 23:09.040
point, that I have the point, now it's okay, let's see, my comeback, so we have to think

23:09.040 --> 23:24.360
about it, to think, to continue in her thoughts, to find experience, oh gosh, that's a question.

23:24.360 --> 23:38.880
Coming back to the structure of experience, what I, now, we have this three characteristic,

23:38.880 --> 23:45.160
and what I got from you is basically that, the understanding of them comes, all of them,

23:45.160 --> 23:51.280
it's not like a sequence, because I was thinking that you must, by understanding Anichar,

23:51.280 --> 23:57.520
to ask the little car, and then you go to the next one to understand, no, no, no, it's

23:57.520 --> 24:04.120
one insight that you can develop, it has these three characteristics, so you might not

24:04.120 --> 24:09.200
necessarily be equally discerning all the characteristics, but you see them all, to

24:09.200 --> 24:14.000
some extent, hence the insight is there, it's same with the four normal truths, it's

24:14.000 --> 24:19.440
just four aspects of the one thing, not like one, and then you go to second, and then

24:19.440 --> 24:25.480
after a few days you reach the third, no, it's basically just four ways of laying out every

24:25.480 --> 24:30.400
aspect of that one insight, which is freedom from suffering, the one who is free from suffering

24:30.400 --> 24:33.800
knows what the suffering is, if he doesn't know what the suffering is, he wouldn't be

24:33.800 --> 24:38.440
able to be free from it, he knows how that suffering arises, he knows how that suffering

24:38.440 --> 24:43.800
came to be, he knows how that suffering ceases, and he knows what he needs to do, and that's

24:43.800 --> 24:48.480
all in one insight, but if you want to teach that one insight to somebody, this is the

24:48.480 --> 24:55.320
ultimate way, the most accurate precise way to lay it out, as for aspects they need

24:55.320 --> 25:02.960
to be covered, that's why I forgot, when he breaks it down to free, you need to develop

25:02.960 --> 25:12.620
free, and the kind of four normal truths become like 12 parts of steps, so to speak, where

25:12.620 --> 25:19.840
every truth needs to be developed fully, so you realize to understand, so you have the

25:19.840 --> 25:28.160
four aspects, if you fully develop four aspects, and each aspect can be developed threefold,

25:28.160 --> 25:32.280
and then you get 12, so in that sense you get 4 and 12, but it's not like one, two, three,

25:32.280 --> 25:38.360
four, five, it's just one insight, it's describing four, and each of those describing three

25:38.360 --> 25:44.680
other ones, two people, whose mind can discern that far, but ultimately all you understand

25:44.680 --> 25:51.280
is arising of suffering and freedom from it, which is again, in order to be free from

25:51.280 --> 25:55.180
suffering, you need to recognize the suffering as a reason, and as a phenomenon you have

25:55.180 --> 26:03.100
to recognize it for what it is, but some aspect can be more prominent, can be, what sure,

26:03.100 --> 26:07.980
you might be clear in some aspects, but that means basically there is still some ignorance

26:07.980 --> 26:12.740
left in regards to it, so if you fully develop all four aspects, you'll be an arant, which

26:12.740 --> 26:18.260
means Arya does not have all four aspects fully developed, he has them to some extent,

26:18.260 --> 26:24.020
but he has them, he has the four normal truths, and are they necessary, yes, yes, yes,

26:24.020 --> 26:28.020
well no, that's just an approach, that's just an approach, yes, the one that do the four

26:28.020 --> 26:31.860
aspects become arant, no, it's not necessary in a sense, you have to, as I said, it's not,

26:31.860 --> 26:36.740
it's not a fixed method, it's just one goal, as I would have said, you only teach your

26:36.740 --> 26:41.500
suffering in freedom from it, as the ocean has only, does it taste the salt, no matter where

26:41.500 --> 26:46.140
it is, so he's teaching freedom from suffering, that's it, so no matter what approach you

26:46.140 --> 26:49.540
take, no matter through what suit you arrive at understanding, no matter how different

26:49.540 --> 26:53.260
you might sound, those are not all methods you have to cover, they all point at the same

26:53.260 --> 26:57.780
thing, so if you arrive at the same thing, that's all it matters, so if somebody arrives

26:57.780 --> 27:01.580
at the same thing to the contemplation of the nature of suffering, craving in regard

27:01.580 --> 27:06.940
to it and so on, then he becomes free from suffering, he becomes an arant, he full of it,

27:06.940 --> 27:10.940
that's it, if somebody, you know, with a different mind arrives during the standing of this

27:10.940 --> 27:15.620
single tennis principle, which is a particular part of the actual emperor, he becomes free

27:15.620 --> 27:20.060
from suffering, it's the same result, that's why sometimes, that's when he never meant

27:20.060 --> 27:24.180
that sometimes even people with the right view might actually hesitate if they were to

27:24.180 --> 27:28.540
distract but teach his own father as twelve factors, because it's a subtle thing to see,

27:28.540 --> 27:32.020
and they might have arrived differently at the freedom from suffering, and then they

27:32.020 --> 27:36.820
never thought of a teachable father in that relevant manner, they thought it all, it's

27:36.820 --> 27:39.900
with some explanation and they don't care about it, why, because they arrived at freedom

27:39.900 --> 27:44.540
from suffering through some completely different approach, again, from the suitors, that's

27:44.540 --> 27:48.900
why they have arhands with like different extents of the wisdom, some have arrived only through

27:48.900 --> 27:53.580
like a single kind of approach, they've really committed to it, had faith in, some arrived

27:53.580 --> 27:58.340
through discernment of many different approaches that kind of brought mind to fulfillment, and

27:58.340 --> 28:02.260
their wisdom, basically wisdom is great, that's why they can teach better, they can understand

28:02.260 --> 28:07.700
better, but not all of them can, but some of them can only teach in the manner that

28:07.700 --> 28:11.180
they reached, but it doesn't mean that they are less, because the Buddha said it doesn't

28:11.180 --> 28:15.220
matter how you reach it, or how why you have to circle in order to reach it, the point

28:15.220 --> 28:23.740
is to reach it, so that's why the faith type, the wisdom type and the kind of meditation

28:23.740 --> 28:28.460
sort of translation, meditation type, one through samadhi, none of them is better than the

28:28.460 --> 28:32.420
other, the one who is the best is the one who becomes an arhand, and then you can come

28:32.420 --> 28:37.500
an arhand on the base, do these three things, so it's not like, oh, he's a better arhand

28:37.500 --> 28:41.340
because he arrived through wisdom, and then he's a worse arhand because he arrived through

28:41.340 --> 28:53.500
faith, no, both are arhands, that's all it matters, yeah, they're good, and they're also

28:53.500 --> 28:58.940
talking about this anichar, can you say it again, what is actually anichar?

28:58.940 --> 29:09.900
Again, because it would be hard to undo the notion of material sort of scientific impermanence

29:09.900 --> 29:16.020
because people say it's impermanent, they expect its destruction, and they often use that

29:16.020 --> 29:20.500
as a proof of impermanent, once something has been destroyed, you say it has truly

29:20.500 --> 29:25.340
looked up, these things are all impermanent, but you not just that that doesn't make any

29:25.340 --> 29:30.340
any kind of relevant sense for the freedom of the sense of self, but also you can't even

29:30.340 --> 29:33.860
apply it in that sense because it would require you to kill yourself, to destroy yourself,

29:33.860 --> 29:39.380
to see yourself as not yourself, so in order to see or not self, you need actually you

29:39.380 --> 29:45.580
require the phenomenon of self, to see it as not belonging to you, but if you destroy

29:45.580 --> 29:51.300
it, even before you see it, means you completely sort of, well, you entirely, just entirely

29:51.300 --> 29:56.500
block your own problem, you can't possibly remove any basis for discernment of that particular

29:56.500 --> 30:05.500
thing, so you should really think anichar, as I said, it's a kind of wide basis, like

30:05.500 --> 30:11.700
in Sanskrit, it means everlasting, but even the definition by the way of permanent, if

30:11.700 --> 30:16.780
you look at English definitions, that means lasting until it comes to an end, so it has

30:16.780 --> 30:23.100
permanent presence until it disappears, so the whole ocean of eternal gets kind of creeps

30:23.100 --> 30:28.620
into that sense of self and then, oh, eternal, non-internal, and so on, but even that can

30:28.620 --> 30:33.300
be too abstract for people, so the more practical level, if you want to look at anichar, means

30:33.300 --> 30:39.820
basically out of your control, that which is present but cannot be owned, cannot be truly

30:39.820 --> 30:46.420
in your possession, in your mastery, and you recognize everything accesses that degree

30:46.420 --> 30:51.300
of resistance, to some degree, everything accesses resistance to some degree to you, which

30:51.300 --> 30:57.940
means everything shares the nature of anichar to you, and it's that varying degrees of

30:57.940 --> 31:03.180
anichar that confuse people in thinking that things that are kind of accesses in less

31:03.180 --> 31:09.780
of an independence kind of resistance attitude towards you, you confuse them as yours, because

31:09.780 --> 31:15.420
it's resisting you less, but it's not a question of not resisting you at all, it's just

31:15.420 --> 31:22.060
a question of basically things are impermanent and less impermanent, but they're still impermanent.

31:22.060 --> 31:27.380
In other words, things are out of your control, some of them more so, some of them less so,

31:27.380 --> 31:32.900
but fundamentally none of them is fully in your control, and that's all it takes just

31:32.900 --> 31:38.500
to recognize that then, oh, so then this whole motion of self, there is the notion of

31:38.500 --> 31:43.820
absolute control, there is a self cannot be based upon partial control, if self recognizes

31:43.820 --> 31:47.980
partial control elsewhere, means it's taking full control somewhere else, that's why

31:47.980 --> 31:52.140
it's established upon, so you might dismiss everything saying, oh no, this is mine because

31:52.140 --> 31:56.780
I don't control it, but maybe that very thought is something you think you control, so

31:56.780 --> 32:00.900
you send the self remains and then getting to that, so that's why you need to include

32:00.900 --> 32:05.260
a peripheral of the general nature whereby you kind of scoop it all up and then discern

32:05.260 --> 32:09.900
it within that, because if you keep chasing where yourself is established you won't find

32:09.900 --> 32:16.060
it, because it's always going to slip to the next thing, so again, a nature as that

32:16.060 --> 32:22.780
sounds like the nature also as one of the meaning is there an internal, personal, personal,

32:22.780 --> 32:27.500
so contemplate the nature of personal, take something that you always is personal, if

32:27.500 --> 32:32.260
you were to say that, what do you refer to, but what do I refer to personal, and you

32:32.260 --> 32:36.660
would see kind of fuel to describe it phenomenologically, that experience, you would be referring

32:36.660 --> 32:42.700
to something that's close, almost inside, in relation to the outside, it's something

32:42.700 --> 32:48.740
right here, so that's why it's personal, that's why you took possession of it, that's

32:48.740 --> 32:54.180
why you guard it, that's why you kind of shelter it, but if you recognize that none of

32:54.180 --> 33:00.380
the things can be personal in that sense, that's how you discern it, and that's what

33:00.380 --> 33:04.700
any change, but recognizing that none of that can be personal, that any of that can

33:04.700 --> 33:11.900
come to an end at any time, and you recognize that while the thing is still present, that's

33:11.900 --> 33:17.100
how you sort of, while you recognize danger, you're holding onto something that will sort

33:17.100 --> 33:22.660
of pull you to death because of you holding, not because you have to die, just because

33:22.660 --> 33:27.980
you're gripping onto it, so you recognize that all of these things that I hold there,

33:27.980 --> 33:32.460
for that very reason, just for that very reason, can't be a result of my demise, and that's

33:32.460 --> 33:36.940
very dangerous, but at the same time it becomes very liberating, recognizing that because

33:36.940 --> 33:41.980
then you let go of it, so even if you keep surrounding the video possessions and stuff,

33:41.980 --> 33:46.620
none of them will be regarded on that personal level, so if something happens, if you lose

33:46.620 --> 33:51.540
your house, if you lose this, if you lose your friend, that's it, the mind will not be

33:51.540 --> 33:57.420
affected, you won't be shattered by that, because it has withdrawn, recalled away from it,

33:57.420 --> 34:02.860
before it disappeared, before it took you away, and that's what any change is, that's

34:02.860 --> 34:07.900
where, again, automatically by recognizing an issue, properly, you recognize that suffering

34:07.900 --> 34:12.740
in it, just for that reason, not because you might be a very good thing, might be a very

34:12.740 --> 34:18.260
happy thing, family, children, all that, by automatically simultaneously better, by

34:18.260 --> 34:21.780
recognizing suffering, you don't regard that as dear, you don't regard it as personal,

34:21.780 --> 34:27.300
you don't regard that as mine, you cannot possibly, because in order to have that attitude

34:27.300 --> 34:33.580
of mine, that lingering notion of mine belonging to me, you need to see as personal, you need

34:33.580 --> 34:41.420
to see it as dear, you need to see as worthy, as pleasure, as non-painterous, so can you

34:41.420 --> 34:52.140
say that actually, you know, what you consider to be self is not yourself, if I summarize

34:52.140 --> 34:57.380
the whole point, so the only point is just, so, to summarize it more accurately, but you

34:57.380 --> 35:03.780
can see that, that which you take to be yourself, is a real thing, that's what I want to

35:03.780 --> 35:09.100
ask, you just have to remove your sense of ownership in regard to that notion, yes, so

35:09.100 --> 35:13.300
that notion is still basically there, but you don't consider it, but you can't see that

35:13.300 --> 35:18.180
notion directly, that's why this whole point of training your mind in peripheral recognition,

35:18.180 --> 35:23.980
that's how you start including that vague notion of self, that vague notion of ownership,

35:23.980 --> 35:28.860
that vague notion of master external to this, you start including into that peripheral

35:28.860 --> 35:35.260
that you see it's present while the actual has a reason, so if the mind becomes established

35:35.260 --> 35:41.580
in that peripheral, you realize self never appears as a direct object, because it wouldn't

35:41.580 --> 35:46.220
be the self, which means in order to tackle the self, you need to see the self, you need

35:46.220 --> 35:49.500
to see the phenomenon yourself, in order to see the phenomenon yourself, you need to learn

35:49.500 --> 35:55.580
how to see an ambiguous phenomena, as ambiguous phenomena, not over define it into that which

35:55.580 --> 36:03.860
you expect it to be, but basically see how it has a reason, it's kind of weird, kind of

36:03.860 --> 36:10.660
hard to decide, put in world, hard to put a finger on, notion sense of self, of master,

36:10.660 --> 36:14.820
that might have kind of a memory of your face attached to it, or something like that,

36:14.820 --> 36:20.980
but anyway, it's a sort of ambiguous phenomena, the nevertheless is present as such, so

36:20.980 --> 36:24.780
learning how to see peripheral, you learn how to recognize this phenomena for what

36:24.780 --> 36:28.700
they are, so then when you see there's that peripheral, you don't need to feel it, you

36:28.700 --> 36:31.940
don't make it actually, you don't redefine it, you don't need to destroy it, or you need

36:31.940 --> 36:37.980
to stop regarding it as yours, and then utter becomes un-attacked, that's it, this self

36:37.980 --> 36:42.220
becomes not self, it doesn't become no self, like there was never self, no there was,

36:42.220 --> 36:47.420
if there was never self, you would not have the self, so it's just a mistake of ownership,

36:47.420 --> 36:51.220
that's when you never said when a person disappears, but to a general, when they sent

36:51.220 --> 36:56.780
out of either disappears individual remains, so that vague general notion basically might

36:56.780 --> 37:01.740
remain, but it won't be regarded as this supreme master of experience, and above all,

37:01.740 --> 37:06.260
it won't be regarded as independent of the five aggregates, it won't be regarded as

37:06.260 --> 37:11.540
an independent of the experience as a whole, actual and peripheral, it will be seen as

37:11.540 --> 37:17.820
just the basically sort of kind of unnatural, natural center of actual and peripheral

37:17.820 --> 37:24.580
of the tensorism on its own, that's when individuals vary, individuals are different,

37:24.580 --> 37:35.260
some people sort of are, like Arahans vary, they don't turn into the same identical blank

37:35.260 --> 37:42.660
five aggregates, different individual, different preferences, different notions and so on,

37:42.660 --> 37:47.460
but there is no assumption in regard to the individual, assumption of ownership, assumption

37:47.460 --> 37:53.020
of self, and then obviously assumption of the self view as a completely independent sense

37:53.020 --> 37:57.020
of self, completely independent of any of the five aggregates, it's sort of a manager

37:57.020 --> 38:09.620
and master of them externally, ties in together nicely when you're speaking from the

38:09.620 --> 38:14.460
same thing, it's the same thing, it's not like many different sort of all, wow, that's

38:14.460 --> 38:20.140
really clever, no, it's just one thing, explaining millions of different ways by the same thing,

38:20.140 --> 38:29.500
the same point, the same principle, the same image, so to speak, yes, yes, yes, yes,

38:29.500 --> 38:35.900
but you want basically see that that point is not just like object of your thinking, but

38:35.900 --> 38:39.900
it's pointing to the structure of the idea, is that clear, is that clear, yeah, that's

38:39.900 --> 38:47.580
very basic way, from other questions, yeah, because if it's, if it's just an objective

38:47.580 --> 38:51.740
thinking, that means everything else underneath it is completely left untouched, you cannot

38:51.740 --> 39:21.580
never reach the end of the suffering if you just make it another object, yeah, exactly, yes,
