WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.400
There are many different questions. I don't know if we will get to them all today. I don't

00:19.400 --> 00:26.600
know how much time you have. One question which I had asked on YouTube, maybe we could

00:26.600 --> 00:37.840
start with that was about the term peripheral awareness. Basically, I read your essay about

00:37.840 --> 00:45.880
it and I listened to a couple of videos. Basically, whenever you start talking about peripheral

00:45.880 --> 00:53.560
or awareness, I would get a little bit confused because the word is not, it really can begin

00:53.560 --> 01:00.680
to push it different ways. I was trying to understand exactly what it means, the peripheral

01:00.680 --> 01:09.160
awareness. What I had asked on when I wrote on YouTube, I basically tried to describe how

01:09.160 --> 01:19.600
I was understanding it so that you could tell me if it was correct or not. How I gathered

01:19.600 --> 01:25.240
from it was that it's basically like, let's say if I'm sitting here talking to you on

01:25.240 --> 01:30.720
the chair, an example you talk about having peripheral awareness with the reference point

01:30.720 --> 01:35.920
of sitting. For example, I'm sitting here talking to you on the chair, formulating my

01:35.920 --> 01:44.240
question and figuring out how to put it well. I should have a background awareness of the

01:44.240 --> 01:57.680
fact that I'm sitting, for example. Maybe before we get too far into it, it's not necessarily

01:57.680 --> 02:03.160
like you must have it in a sense of, I must make this effort and maintain this background.

02:03.160 --> 02:08.680
You just need to recognize it as that which is already there. That's in those talks I

02:08.680 --> 02:13.720
think I was, when I was describing peripheral awareness, I ended up talking about the knowledge

02:13.720 --> 02:18.960
which is already peripheral in its nature. You already know you're seated, you already

02:18.960 --> 02:23.240
know the door is closed, you already know you're talking to me. All these things are

02:23.240 --> 02:28.800
already there. You are not attending them. You don't need to keep telling to yourself

02:28.800 --> 02:32.800
while you're talking to me that you are seated, you are seated. But if I were to ask in the

02:32.800 --> 02:36.800
middle of your sentence about something different, are you seated? You would immediately have

02:36.800 --> 02:44.920
the answer. Which means that knowledge is already there without not being required to

02:44.920 --> 02:51.240
be directly attended. So it's peripheral. Peripheral awareness can be basically the recognition

02:51.240 --> 02:57.720
of that which you already know there which is a basis of your situation. So it's subtle

02:57.720 --> 03:03.280
because often yes, people would kind of hear it and then immediately say, Peripheral awareness

03:03.280 --> 03:09.200
is something I must do in this peripheral manner. But then they end up still in the same sense

03:09.200 --> 03:22.000
trying to attend to it. But as I said, instead of attending to or I'm seated, I'm seated,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.200
you just want to recognize the level of that knowledge and not keep having to answer it

03:26.200 --> 03:36.440
to yourself because you already know the answer. Okay, so then, but what would be the difference

03:36.440 --> 03:44.080
between like somebody who is practicing, practicing peripheral awareness or kind of working on

03:44.080 --> 03:47.200
it is something you still have to work on. If I understand well, it's like not because

03:47.200 --> 03:52.760
otherwise what I'm trying to understand is the difference between somebody practicing

03:52.760 --> 03:59.560
mindfulness as you explain. And somebody who's like a normal person just going about their

03:59.560 --> 04:03.200
daily life who also knows that the door is closed, who also knows that they're seated,

04:03.200 --> 04:06.480
who also knows that they're yeah, but they're not that they're talking, they're not aware

04:06.480 --> 04:11.000
of it. They know if they ask the question, but they don't have the awareness of their

04:11.000 --> 04:15.320
knowledge, persisting is a base of their situation. Because if they did, they would experience

04:15.320 --> 04:19.480
this passion. They would not be able to engage with central desires and ill will yet they

04:19.480 --> 04:24.680
do, which means they don't have the right knowledge. Like, yes, if they stop and ask

04:24.680 --> 04:29.040
themselves, they will know it. So it's not knowing that the door is closed or you're

04:29.040 --> 04:33.920
seated, but it's being aware of the knowledge that the door is closed and you're seated

04:33.920 --> 04:38.560
while you're engaged with other things. So it's really the relationship between the peripheral

04:38.560 --> 04:43.400
and what you're choosing to attend to. And that's exactly why the mindfulness is that

04:43.400 --> 04:49.960
framework, the container. And that's exactly why it needs developing. Now, just, yeah,

04:49.960 --> 04:55.440
I know I'm seated, full stop, I completed the mindfulness. No, is the relationship between

04:55.440 --> 05:00.680
your knowledge that you're seated and what you choose to do, intend, speak, think while

05:00.680 --> 05:04.040
you're seated on the basis of that situation.

05:04.040 --> 05:15.760
Okay, so you say it's okay, it's the relationship between the knowledge that you are seated and

05:15.760 --> 05:30.760
what you choose to do on the basis of that situation. So now, okay, so you're aware that

05:30.760 --> 05:35.840
you're seated, you know that you're aware of that you know that you are seated in the

05:35.840 --> 05:41.080
sense. And like, my other kind of question was, so this, like this, like knowing being

05:41.080 --> 05:46.840
aware of being seated is basically, you're basically aware of a sensation, right? Like

05:46.840 --> 05:54.320
being aware that the of your position, like you don't need sensations for the knowledge

05:54.320 --> 05:58.600
of your seated position, you have the knowledge, which is why you know what sensations to look

05:58.600 --> 06:04.320
for. So the knowledge comes first, not the sensations. It's usually that expectation of

06:04.320 --> 06:09.560
your attention to find something more substantial that needs to discern these sensations, they

06:09.560 --> 06:14.000
would then be a representation of the seated, but you already know you're seated. You can

06:14.000 --> 06:18.400
answer to me, are you seated? You could give me immediate answer before you tap into your

06:18.400 --> 06:22.360
sensations of seated body, which is always secondary to the knowledge that you are already

06:22.360 --> 06:28.840
seated. So that's how many it's actually shot like that, then just attending to the sensations

06:28.840 --> 06:36.480
of, I don't know, touching the chair or something like that. It's the knowledge of it.

06:36.480 --> 06:44.760
But I know that I'm seated because I chose to sit down, like I chose to sit down and

06:44.760 --> 06:50.680
now I am now I'm seated. Yeah. And you don't need sensations to confirm to you what you

06:50.680 --> 06:57.560
already know that you're seated. They're completely redundant actually, how your body feels and

06:57.560 --> 07:02.880
how the chair where it presses you and stuff, it's completely redundant. You're seated and

07:02.880 --> 07:06.920
you said to yourself, you know you're seated because you chose to sit down. There were

07:06.920 --> 07:10.920
no sensations involved in your choice of sitting down. It was like, Oh, I want to sit down.

07:10.920 --> 07:16.320
I need to sit down. It's better to sit down. All these other intentions. Yet when we speak

07:16.320 --> 07:21.400
about it, people think, Oh, since it, why would you bring the sensations into it then?

07:21.400 --> 07:25.120
When you realize had nothing to do with neither your decision, nor the knowledge of being

07:25.120 --> 07:30.840
seated. I mean, I know why because everybody does that. That's like the natural kind of

07:30.840 --> 07:36.160
how must look closer to the sensations or something as if somehow that analysis more

07:36.160 --> 07:40.920
of you know, you see, if you want to analyze the nature of being seated, as exactly as

07:40.920 --> 07:46.840
you did kind of spontaneously, our intention to sit down brought me here, which means your

07:46.840 --> 07:50.880
intention to sit down is still present there with you. It wasn't half an hour ago when

07:50.880 --> 07:57.600
you said it remains enduring while you're seated. Because if your intention to be seated changes,

07:57.600 --> 08:04.960
you will stand up or lay down. So and that's another thing. Yeah, in the relationship with

08:04.960 --> 08:09.760
those other in the same peripheral awareness talks is that knowing the intention why you

08:09.760 --> 08:14.880
want it like, Oh, I'm doing this. And then knowing that while you're doing it, your intention

08:14.880 --> 08:20.280
is persistently kind of it's enduring. There is a binding factor. You're not like going

08:20.280 --> 08:25.040
to moment to moment awareness. No, the knowledge of what you want to do is the uniform factor

08:25.040 --> 08:30.240
of all of your particular little actions. So the knowledge of what you're going to do

08:30.240 --> 08:35.400
is basically the framework of your current action. If you want to be mindful of it.

08:35.400 --> 08:43.280
Okay, so if I try to kind of put it in in language for under six years old, it would

08:43.280 --> 08:47.280
be like, yeah, basically, I know that I know that I'm sitting down based on the fact that

08:47.280 --> 08:53.720
I had the intention to sit down. And it's like, and that I and that I still choose to keep

08:53.720 --> 09:02.400
sitting down. This is like the main, this is the first thing that comes. Like, or the.

09:02.400 --> 09:08.400
Because I agree, I agree that sensation, like, don't need to take that further in a sense.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.760
What do I do now? Like with this knowledge of being seated, you just need to start using

09:12.760 --> 09:17.880
it as a basis. They will take away from being self centered with your point of view towards

09:17.880 --> 09:24.240
what you attend to and see whatever you choose to attend to on a basis of this seated situation.

09:24.240 --> 09:29.040
That's where the Buddha would say, like, when he was still the bodhisattva in the forest walking

09:29.040 --> 09:33.560
in doing a walking meditation or something, and he would say, if there is like an unwholesome

09:33.560 --> 09:40.120
state with a rise in my mind, fear or something, I would not change my position until I first

09:40.120 --> 09:46.480
dispel the fear. Then if I happened to be seated, and then there was lust or fear, again, I

09:46.480 --> 09:52.840
wouldn't stand up until I dispelled the fear. So he wouldn't change the basis of his situation

09:52.840 --> 09:58.080
because it would mean he acted out of lust or fear or anything unwholesome. So he used

09:58.080 --> 10:03.040
the basis of situation as an enduring framework, container for whatever present phenomenon

10:03.040 --> 10:09.600
has been kind of besetting his mind. But without the factorial basis of your situation, such

10:09.600 --> 10:15.360
as your body, your body posture, your current enduring feeling, anything from such a patana,

10:15.360 --> 10:19.480
you will be engaged with a current state of mind through your point of view. And that's

10:19.480 --> 10:25.200
exactly what that self-centeredness and conceit involves. It's not like the people are choose

10:25.200 --> 10:29.480
to be conceited. They just don't know. They have no other reference point between them

10:29.480 --> 10:34.280
and what they attend to. So the knowledge I'm describing, it's not like, oh, I need

10:34.280 --> 10:38.640
to clarify this knowledge more in a sense of, get more details about it, although that

10:38.640 --> 10:43.880
can be helpful for somebody. It's more like, now that I'm clear, now that I know it, I

10:43.880 --> 10:48.840
need to stop attending that and use it as a basis for what I'm attending. And that's

10:48.840 --> 10:52.840
what I mean, the relationship between the two, that then eventually you develop that

10:52.840 --> 10:57.560
sufficiently enough, your sense of self, the self-centered point of view that chooses

10:57.560 --> 11:01.880
to attend and thinks it's the receptor of these things that come through senses will

11:01.880 --> 11:06.840
be made redundant. And then it's just, as the Buddha would say inside the patana, oh,

11:06.840 --> 11:10.320
he knows there is the presence of the last full mind, as the last full mind, there is

11:10.320 --> 11:13.840
a non-last full mind, as a non-last full mind, elated mind, depressed mind, doesn't

11:13.840 --> 11:18.920
matter. It's not like, I am depressed, I am lustful, I'm hateful or something like that.

11:18.920 --> 11:26.520
Yeah, yeah, this, this I understand, I mean, I, I agree, the, that's,

11:26.520 --> 11:31.320
Yeah, I think many people get this part, many people get this part from satipatana. But

11:31.320 --> 11:35.840
what I'm trying to describe is the only way to get it is to establish the proper basis

11:35.840 --> 11:40.880
of mindfulness of the level of the knowledge, not on the level of kind of sensations or

11:40.880 --> 11:46.240
something that I choose, I choose to attend as representative of the seated position,

11:46.240 --> 11:50.240
which means still puts you in the center, the driving seat.

11:50.240 --> 11:59.520
Yeah, and yeah, this I, this I agree to, but like, I agree, like always, because always

11:59.520 --> 12:05.840
the mind, like always people are just, like, looking at what they see, what they hear,

12:05.840 --> 12:12.240
what you, what you think, what you are, like, what I, what I want, what I don't want, what

12:12.240 --> 12:17.240
I feel, what I, so this, like, if you look always outside, this I see, that if you're

12:17.240 --> 12:23.400
just looking outside at the objects of my, my senses or object of my, like, outside

12:23.400 --> 12:29.440
of my attention, then this is no good, because it's just I am, I am seeing this, I am hearing

12:29.440 --> 12:34.640
this, I am automatically, it's this, what I would add there is that even the notion

12:34.640 --> 12:41.480
of sensations is also another thing that's outside, outside to self-centeredness. Yeah.

12:41.480 --> 12:47.360
So the only thing that's behind the only thing that's not outside of your point of view,

12:47.360 --> 12:53.520
not like the where your attention can land is what's peripheral to it, which is the level

12:53.520 --> 12:59.880
of the knowledge. You cannot make that into physical sense, like, because that becomes

12:59.880 --> 13:06.360
something you can send. So even your body posture is to be known as such, not attended

13:06.360 --> 13:13.440
and felt as often describing contemporary sort of Buddhist teachings and so on. Yeah.

13:13.440 --> 13:20.280
So that's the, that's the difference. Yeah. I mean, yeah, like I understand, I, I agree

13:20.280 --> 13:25.640
with you about sensations and that was why I was like, kind of doubtful about this, kind

13:25.640 --> 13:31.880
of doubtful about the idea of, of it, if it consists of sensations, then, then it's not

13:31.880 --> 13:34.800
correct because you're just paying, yeah, you're just paying attention to something

13:34.800 --> 13:40.600
that's like theory outside of you. Yeah. Yeah. There's no wisdom that can arise from there.

13:40.600 --> 13:46.160
And wisdom is like, as you say, it has to be on the level of what knows the thing that

13:46.160 --> 13:53.120
the thing that knows, like the wisdom comes from the, from basically completely bypassing

13:53.120 --> 13:59.600
and extinguishing that self-centered point of view. When, as I said, your sense of self

13:59.600 --> 14:06.840
is made redundant. Like you just know, the body is as such, feelings as as such, thoughts

14:06.840 --> 14:11.520
are as, are as such and so on. So there is no like, oh, I am choosing this, there is

14:11.520 --> 14:15.880
choice present. And then you choose whether to attend to it further or not based on the

14:15.880 --> 14:22.000
wisdom you developed. Yeah. And that's when somebody who is not free from that self-centered

14:22.000 --> 14:26.800
is they cannot choose to cease to be self-centered because that would be a self-centered choice

14:26.800 --> 14:32.680
they make. So they need to undermine it and hardy undermine it by digging under. And what's

14:32.680 --> 14:36.720
basically under from where you're standing, it can be called peripheral, not direct in

14:36.720 --> 14:43.160
front of you. So that's why I use that word basically just to give the idea to people.

14:43.160 --> 14:48.200
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So if I just to back up a bit, like now, yeah, you know, you kind

14:48.200 --> 14:53.720
of came back to it anyway. When you use the word peripheral, if I understand well, you

14:53.720 --> 15:03.200
can correct me. It's basically, is it meaning that it's not something that's not an object

15:03.200 --> 15:10.200
of your senses? It's not an object like what is what is not the direct object of of your

15:10.200 --> 15:14.240
attention? Yeah, exactly. Because if it becomes a direct object of your attention, then something

15:14.240 --> 15:20.440
else is peripheral because now what you're attending can only be direct as opposed to

15:20.440 --> 15:30.920
peripheral. Yeah. So it's not an object of an object of your senses. So all like, so it's

15:30.920 --> 15:35.920
not a sensation, not that you can't be just paying attention to sensations or sounds or

15:35.920 --> 15:43.840
or whatever. And when you said example that you have to be kind of develop the awareness

15:43.840 --> 15:50.560
on the level of knowledge, then this is on the level of like being aware of the almost

15:50.560 --> 15:57.400
being aware of the attention itself, like being kind of well, being being aware of your

15:57.400 --> 16:01.240
attention, what's peripheral to that which you're attending? And that's exactly the

16:01.240 --> 16:06.080
definition of the only someone has a car, the only so meaning the womb of your attention,

16:06.080 --> 16:12.280
not the attention. So in the same sense, and I cannot see itself, but you know that there

16:12.280 --> 16:17.360
is an eye present for as long as there is a sight present. So it's already, it's already

16:17.360 --> 16:23.200
the peripheral relationship even within your own senses, sense organs and sense objects.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.160
So that's the definition of the only someone's secret is basically not like knowing where

16:27.160 --> 16:32.360
my attention came from in the past or something analyzing the roots of my attention. No, it's

16:32.360 --> 16:38.640
not presently the basis for my current attention, a basis that cannot be attended. Because if

16:38.640 --> 16:43.040
I attend to it, something else is the basis for my current attending of that which I thought

16:43.040 --> 16:49.400
was the basis. So if you keep trying to kind of attend it, it's like a dog chasing its

16:49.400 --> 17:13.360
own tail to the extent you try to reach you to that extent the tail escapes you.

17:13.360 --> 17:21.680
Okay, so you were saying about, you mentioned about actions as well, about like the intention

17:21.680 --> 17:31.640
of your actions, how you can be like have the peripheral, like yeah, keep this as the basis

17:31.640 --> 17:37.800
of mindfulness essentially. And this I found is interesting because I, because it's sort

17:37.800 --> 17:48.480
of easier for, it's easier to understand than like a body posture. Because this is like

17:48.480 --> 17:53.040
if you intend, like if you intend to do something, if you have an intention of even just moving

17:53.040 --> 18:04.960
or speaking or something, then like to be, to keep the awareness of attention I can understand

18:04.960 --> 18:13.400
this easier as a, as a base mindfulness, because also because it's something that like is really

18:13.400 --> 18:18.320
directly linked to removing, removing KLSA because your intentions are driven either

18:18.320 --> 18:27.840
driven usually by, by greed, by like a version or by, by, by a MOHA by not knowing if I understand

18:27.840 --> 18:35.040
well. So then like being aware of the intention. But what I was less clear about was how you

18:35.040 --> 18:45.440
were kind of talking of it as a sort of like a general background of your like general

18:45.440 --> 18:52.400
background of your experience or something. Maybe I'm not remembering it well. But as

18:52.400 --> 18:56.160
I go from what I can observe an intention is always something quite, it's more like

18:56.160 --> 19:01.840
a particular, it's quite specific, like you, let's see, let's see, let's see, right now

19:01.840 --> 19:08.080
I have the intention of speaking this word. Yeah, yeah, no, that is a choice what you're

19:08.080 --> 19:14.800
talking about, which is more particular. But choice is basically intentional intention.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.960
But the only reason you can make the choice is because you have general intentions as

19:18.960 --> 19:24.920
possibilities that you can choose, because you can choose to speak or be silent. You

19:24.920 --> 19:29.240
can choose to say one thing or the other. And then it becomes particular making of the

19:29.240 --> 19:37.560
choice. But that choice can only be made because these intentions are already given as possibilities.

19:37.560 --> 19:45.240
So that's the difference between like intention and intentional intention, which is what we

19:45.240 --> 19:51.080
commonly call a choice. That's the difference between like the relationship between like

19:51.080 --> 19:55.880
the intentional mind, the chitta, and then chetana, which is the actual intention of

19:55.880 --> 20:00.760
the choice that you make on account of the mind, they gave you this option. So the last

20:00.760 --> 20:06.680
full mind will lean your choices towards choices of lust and so on. Now, if you have wisdom on

20:06.680 --> 20:11.640
account towards the whole situation, that's how you can then choose to say no, which is

20:11.640 --> 20:16.760
your first step basically sense restraint and so on. But the intention I'm talking about,

20:16.760 --> 20:21.640
it's not on the level of when you intentionally intend to it and then make a choice. That is

20:21.640 --> 20:26.600
particular. And the only reason it can be particular is because generally the intentions are given

20:26.600 --> 20:31.080
and waiting to, because you can also change your choice as well. You make a choice to do

20:31.080 --> 20:35.080
something, then you change your mind. You still have the other options there.

20:35.080 --> 20:46.920
Yeah. And those options are not particular. They don't sit in front of you.

20:46.920 --> 20:52.840
So when you say intention, you mean like basically the all the possibilities of what you can do.

20:52.840 --> 20:58.200
Pretty much exactly. Yeah. Thoughts, images, damas on the level of possibilities. That's exactly what

20:58.200 --> 21:03.720
what intentions are in that sense. And that's why you then can choose to intend

21:03.720 --> 21:07.720
with a certain leaning of your mind and so on. And that's when it becomes a choice.

21:09.480 --> 21:14.760
So that's you are not responsible for the intentions for their arising,

21:14.760 --> 21:19.240
but you're responsible for intentionally intending them on the basis of the last

21:19.240 --> 21:25.640
a version of delusion. And it's those choices that then will make those intentions arise more

21:25.640 --> 21:30.120
or less for you. So person who keeps acting out of lust will have more options of lust

21:30.120 --> 21:35.320
presented to him. That's like even for the first six, seven years, Mara was harassing the Buddha,

21:36.520 --> 21:42.200
hoping he will take a bite until he realized, no, his mind will never turn to this. And then

21:42.200 --> 21:46.920
he left him alone. And in many other similes that was described the experience of an Arahant.

21:47.720 --> 21:53.000
Now that these intentions suddenly the recognitions of last a version will kind of poof just disappear

21:53.000 --> 21:59.640
in a second. But Arahant's intentional intention of those things he's incapable of. So eventually

21:59.640 --> 22:05.720
these things will completely cool down. And then even as these options that he's not responsible

22:05.720 --> 22:12.040
for, it will cease to appear like the flies will cease to come to the basically, I don't know,

22:12.040 --> 22:17.000
rotting meat if there is no more rotting meat left lying around. The flies will fly around a bit

22:17.000 --> 22:22.600
longer hoping for it or crows. Oh yeah, that was a similar in the suitors. It was a crow. Like Mara

22:22.600 --> 22:28.040
was like a crow seeking what can it bite? What can it pick on? But the Buddha provided nothing

22:28.040 --> 22:35.720
and then the crow just left him. So these intentionalities have just evaporated eventually

22:35.720 --> 22:40.840
because they haven't been maintained and fed through these intentional intentions of last,

22:40.840 --> 22:42.920
a version, distraction and so on.

22:47.320 --> 22:51.960
Okay, so there's a point here. I'm struggling to get a hold of the gears.

22:51.960 --> 22:59.000
Okay, so in the beginning you, okay, so we have the level of like all the possibilities of what

22:59.000 --> 23:05.240
you can do. So but this is like for everybody at any time there's always the possibility of,

23:05.240 --> 23:11.640
let's say, like of the, I don't know, let's just say you have an itch. Everybody can decide whether

23:11.640 --> 23:16.440
to scratch the itch or not to scratch the itch. Okay, there's the both both possibilities there.

23:16.440 --> 23:24.280
Then you have the, then you have the like automatic decision or choice is not really

23:24.280 --> 23:29.560
automatic. You've decided to scratch the itch mostly for most people unless you are aware enough

23:29.560 --> 23:35.400
of the itch, like if you're aware enough beforehand to decide not to or to have the choice that

23:35.960 --> 23:43.160
you see in there. And you couldn't continue.

23:43.160 --> 23:49.160
Well, yeah, no, that's exactly it. You have the two choices because you don't have any other

23:49.160 --> 23:55.000
knowledge. That's exactly why knowledge results in liberation. But if you say the gained knowledge

23:55.000 --> 24:00.920
that you shouldn't scratch, now you have an option to not scratch and you have a reason as an option

24:00.920 --> 24:08.600
to choose to, which you didn't have before. But if you develop the knowledge sufficiently enough

24:08.600 --> 24:15.320
and stop scratching, you will heal. So knowledge resulted in liberation. So it's not that these

24:15.320 --> 24:20.040
choices are universally present for everyone. I mean, of course, scratching nature or not scratching

24:20.040 --> 24:24.920
nature. But what we are talking about is the choices on the level of your mind for greed or

24:24.920 --> 24:33.400
non-greed, a version or non-aversion, delusion, not delusion. And now choices of greed have like

24:33.400 --> 24:38.840
myriad ways of manifesting itself and so on. But all of them share the common nature of being

24:38.840 --> 24:43.720
rooted in greed, which is what you keep persistingly choosing. So then if you start abstaining from

24:43.720 --> 24:49.400
that and learn that maybe greed is not good, suddenly you do recognize the choice of sensory

24:49.400 --> 24:54.120
strength, like sensory strength, for example, an average man today in the world, he doesn't even

24:54.120 --> 24:59.800
have that as an option. It's inconceivable for a person to be sensory strained by their own will.

24:59.800 --> 25:05.320
It needs to be some sort of religious practice, some sort of faith-based determination in their

25:05.320 --> 25:10.120
mind. They cannot fathom it in any other way. But say you start actually understanding the

25:10.120 --> 25:15.800
nature of your condition and start seeing for yourself that scratching the itch is fundamentally

25:15.800 --> 25:22.040
making things worse. Now you have an option that you directly see as valuable, which you did not

25:22.040 --> 25:27.960
have before. So intentions change on the basis of your knowledge and basis of your other intent

25:27.960 --> 25:33.000
because you chose to learn this, you chose to listen to the Dharma, you chose to read the suttas.

25:33.960 --> 25:39.880
So you are responsible now for cultivation of new intentions later on. And that's exactly what

25:39.880 --> 25:46.040
was said, even Nibbana being asankata, being undetermined, it's actually determined, determined by what,

25:46.040 --> 25:51.560
by one's decision to practice and develop it back in the day, not immediately, but you know,

25:51.560 --> 25:57.320
when he left the household life and so on. So the choices he made towards Nibbana determine

25:57.320 --> 25:59.640
the Nibbana eventually resulted in it.

26:06.280 --> 26:17.720
Yeah, so no, yeah, this I understand.

26:17.720 --> 26:31.240
So what I was trying to do, I was trying to become clear on the, okay, so now you say,

26:31.880 --> 26:36.520
like for everybody, they don't even realize, example, because they don't, I would not say,

26:37.240 --> 26:41.560
yeah, most people you don't, they don't think about or you don't realize that you have a choice

26:41.560 --> 26:50.040
in regard to, again, regard to what you do, because most of the time, you're like, you're just

26:50.040 --> 26:57.160
automatically like, by default, you're driven by a reader version delusion from what I can observe.

26:57.160 --> 27:03.960
Well, it becomes, it becomes by default, because people choose to avoid responsibility

27:04.760 --> 27:08.520
for their own choices and their own actions. That's why we always go back to that as well,

27:08.520 --> 27:15.160
as a prerequisite for the right view for the right mindfulness, like a pre prerequisite is

27:15.160 --> 27:20.440
accepting responsibility for basically your choices, your intentions, your actions for everything you

27:20.440 --> 27:25.320
feel, even if it's not your fault, you need to accept responsibility first, because that will

27:25.320 --> 27:31.880
prevent you then from fueling ignoring the nature of your own choice that you do choose to make

27:31.880 --> 27:42.440
as such. So, acting out of greedy version delusion becomes automatic, because you are choosing oblivion

27:42.440 --> 27:48.200
of towards your responsibility, you're ignoring it, you're turning a blind eye that then results

27:48.200 --> 27:53.240
in automatically following desires or scratching, and that's why then people say, oh, it's not my

27:53.240 --> 27:58.200
fault, I just have this, it's true, it's not your fault that your desire is automatic, but it is

27:58.200 --> 28:02.520
your fault that you ignore responsibility in regard to that, which is what makes that desire

28:02.520 --> 28:09.320
look automatic. And the reason people ignore that responsibility is it's unpleasant, and they don't

28:09.320 --> 28:14.120
have enough knowledge with them, they haven't been told enough, they haven't understood sufficiently

28:14.120 --> 28:19.400
that actually, despite being unpleasant, accepting responsibility is beneficial for me.

28:19.400 --> 28:28.680
So, they need to learn, without knowledge, they will not do it. So, it's a vicious circle

28:28.680 --> 28:34.680
of automatically perpetuating that, which makes their desire automatic.

28:34.680 --> 28:47.320
Yeah, I mean, what I was, I was referring to as well, like the fact that,

28:48.360 --> 28:56.680
let's say somebody is in a conversation, and now the, like one of the, one of the people starts,

28:56.680 --> 29:03.960
I'm just going to give an example, one of the people sort of points out to something, the other

29:03.960 --> 29:09.880
one has done wrong, like, let's say you, like you have acted irresponsibly or something like that,

29:10.680 --> 29:16.440
and now, like, what happens for most people in this kind of situation, because speaking is

29:16.440 --> 29:21.640
especially difficult, like, they will automatically just want to defend themselves, like automatically

29:21.640 --> 29:27.480
you just will reply without any, without considering or without thinking about it, without, like,

29:27.480 --> 29:34.200
even if you know, like, even if you want to practice or you know that, like, I am not supposed to,

29:34.200 --> 29:39.160
I don't want to react in this way, I don't want to, like, act defensively, or I don't want to,

29:39.160 --> 29:43.640
like, I don't want to behave in this way, I don't want to behave like in this sort of angry

29:43.640 --> 29:50.920
reaction, but the reaction, like, the mind makes the reaction before you are able to,

29:50.920 --> 29:55.640
like, practice restraint in it, and then people only realize afterwards, like, you become, then

29:55.640 --> 30:03.560
you have regret, oh no, I said that, I shouldn't have said that, so, like, in this sense, the,

30:04.520 --> 30:11.160
like, the choice of react, the choice of replying in a defensive way or in a kind of angry way,

30:11.960 --> 30:17.480
this is something that, because at that, at that moment, there was no awareness there,

30:17.480 --> 30:22.200
there was no, like, block, there was nothing to, like, to stop it from arriving, like, the mind

30:22.200 --> 30:30.760
makes this by, by itself, and then you realize afterwards, so, so what I was kind of wondering

30:30.760 --> 30:36.520
is, is, like, is this what you were, I was wondering if this is part of what you were referring to

30:37.880 --> 30:41.960
in the sense, like, the difference between, like, you have all the, you have the option of

30:41.960 --> 30:48.040
not replying in that way, of not reacting defensively, you do have the, like, you do have the choice,

30:48.040 --> 30:54.200
but because the, because the mind is sort of, like, it just, it just reacts automatically

30:54.200 --> 30:58.840
without you, without you being aware, without you knowing, and then afterwards, you realize,

30:58.840 --> 31:03.320
well, yeah, not quite, at the point you did, it's automatic at the time, and as I said,

31:03.320 --> 31:08.840
the reason why it's automatic is because you maintain the basis for that, so you want to see

31:08.840 --> 31:14.040
where the problem is, in the same sense, you know, having a fever, when you catch a virus,

31:14.040 --> 31:19.720
it's automatic, but what if you learn how to prevent catching a virus, you won't get a fever,

31:19.720 --> 31:25.080
so having a mind move and respond, even if you don't want to and you can't catch it in time,

31:25.080 --> 31:30.520
means, do you are doing something or maintaining something on some level that then makes that

31:30.520 --> 31:36.200
mind overwhelmed, and the very first thing it's in the last talk we posted now, it comes down to that,

31:37.160 --> 31:43.720
whether your value is towards management or towards uprooting, so if you think, you shouldn't be

31:43.720 --> 31:48.360
saying this, you shouldn't be doing that, that's on the level of management, with as I said, everybody

31:48.360 --> 31:53.080
starts like that, but really, you want to see, I don't want to be affected, whether I choose to

31:53.080 --> 32:00.120
speak or not, I should not be affected emotionally, but what was said to me, and for that, you are

32:00.120 --> 32:05.320
responsible, and then you realize, that is the basis for my mind automatically blurting things

32:05.320 --> 32:11.480
out that I shouldn't have said, I was affected, so how can then I not be affected, then I don't

32:11.480 --> 32:18.920
have to worry what mind will say, because it won't be rooted in self-defense, gratuitous, or something

32:18.920 --> 32:23.800
like that, which means he won't be on wholesome, that's why Arhan doesn't need to worry about his

32:23.800 --> 32:28.600
actions in a sense, because he knows whatever he chooses to do will not be rooted in greed,

32:28.600 --> 32:33.720
aversion, or distraction, or delusion, so in that sense, it's not automatic, that's what I mean,

32:34.440 --> 32:39.880
mind blurting stuff, it's automatic, but you, through your other choices, when you're not affected,

32:39.880 --> 32:46.520
arm maintaining the basis, which then makes the mind blur things out verbally, or for some people

32:46.520 --> 33:08.040
physically as well. Okay, so now kind of jumping many, jumping many subjects, but yeah, no, I

33:08.040 --> 33:23.960
actually listened to your last talk yesterday, and I agree with the point that it's not enough

33:23.960 --> 33:29.640
to just become angry, let's say, when somebody says something that points out something you have

33:29.640 --> 33:33.960
done wrong or to want to defend, but even if you're kind of able to restrain yourself, not to say

33:33.960 --> 33:39.880
it is not good enough, like it's not good enough to avoid saying this, I mean, it would still be

33:39.880 --> 33:44.760
better than saying the words and then having regret and having conflict. And that's another

33:44.760 --> 33:49.720
thing, by the way, if the mind automatically blurred stuff out means you haven't developed

33:49.720 --> 33:57.000
restraint sufficiently, doesn't matter how pressing, whatever you want to defend yourself against

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
the choice of not acting out by body by speech by mind always remains there, the fact that you

34:03.000 --> 34:08.600
acted out, the mind said something or thought something means you need to develop more, you need

34:08.600 --> 34:15.000
to be able to hold it more without actually letting in the more you become aware of that lack, so to

34:15.000 --> 34:20.440
speak, the more you'll be able to develop it. But if you think not you specifically, but if a person

34:20.440 --> 34:27.560
might think, oh, the speech happened automatically means you will not look for an upgrade there,

34:27.560 --> 34:32.200
because you don't feel responsible for it now, see, you said, Oh, it's automatic, wasn't my fault,

34:32.200 --> 34:39.160
my fault is later, or avoiding my fault is later what I do. No, it was automatic, but there is a

34:39.160 --> 34:45.560
certain basis for mind acting automatically, basis that lacks the restraint. So you can even,

34:45.560 --> 34:51.320
doesn't matter how automatic it is, you can always choose no. And that's the restraint. And then the

34:51.320 --> 34:56.840
wisdom can come out of it. So even even in a common sense of sensory strain, there is still

34:56.840 --> 35:01.480
something to be done there. Not necessarily, I must discern this basis and why am I affected in the

35:01.480 --> 35:05.880
first place? Yeah, that's all on the level of the person and developing wisdom. But even if you

35:05.880 --> 35:12.360
don't get any of them, you can still keep your mouth shut, literally. So if you blurt out means

35:12.360 --> 35:24.600
your verbal restraint hasn't been strengthened enough. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, like, it's still

35:24.600 --> 35:29.400
I agree, it's still your fault. Like if you still, if you, if you kind of blurt out words automatically,

35:29.400 --> 35:34.680
then it's still your, you're still your fault. But it's your fault kind of in the sense that you

35:34.680 --> 35:40.200
were not, you were not mindful enough, and you were not restrained enough at that point.

35:40.200 --> 35:44.920
Yeah. And from the point of view of one who practices, that's a big fault. Without fixing that fault,

35:44.920 --> 35:49.960
there is no progress. So it's not like, okay, I mean, sure, it's not as bad as somebody who is

35:49.960 --> 35:55.160
no interesting practice, but you don't want to be comparing to that side of things. So restraint

35:55.160 --> 36:00.760
has not been developed. Thus wisdom cannot arise in regard to speech, in regard to being affected

36:00.760 --> 36:06.920
by what other, what other people say. I cannot approach my emotional kind of vulnerability,

36:06.920 --> 36:12.840
so to speak, until I fix this first. So that's, I mean, it's not automatic at all, in a sense.

36:13.720 --> 36:18.360
Like it's just a symptom for which you're not directly responsible in the sense of you are not

36:18.360 --> 36:25.640
generating the symptom, but you're fully responsible for, for the reason of that symptom. Yeah. Yeah.

36:25.640 --> 36:33.240
I mean, yeah, when I say automatic, I kind of, it's a way of, of, of saying that like, even though,

36:33.240 --> 36:39.560
like you don't, yeah, it's the way of saying that you kind of don't deliberately sort of decide,

36:39.560 --> 36:42.840
now I will speak these words, because you know that you're not supposed to say them.

36:42.840 --> 36:49.560
Yeah. That's why we need to, we need to actually start kind of fabricating and investing effort

36:49.560 --> 36:55.960
to develop responsibility for things that don't necessarily feel their fault, because that's the

36:55.960 --> 37:06.440
only way to then actually approach things correctly. And, but especially in regard to speech, it's,

37:06.440 --> 37:17.080
like it's a, it's an interesting point, because, like this, what, because we, we, we, we have said

37:17.080 --> 37:23.640
and we both, like we both agree that you, if you are, if you are speaking things without considering

37:23.640 --> 37:28.920
and then you then have regret later, then it's, it means that you're doing something wrong,

37:28.920 --> 37:33.800
means that you haven't developed enough, enough restraint in regard to your speech and you don't

37:33.800 --> 37:39.320
have enough mindfulness, but like the kind of mindfulness that needs, this is the point I'm

37:39.320 --> 37:44.520
trying to come to actually is that the type of mindfulness that needs to be there in order to

37:44.520 --> 37:49.960
be able to practice restraint in regards to the words that you're saying, obviously it can't be

37:49.960 --> 37:57.160
just about playing with like the sensation of sitting on the chair or being like mindful of the,

37:57.160 --> 38:05.640
like something outside object of your senses, but like so from, from my understanding like if you

38:05.640 --> 38:11.000
need to be aware, basically you need to be aware of your own mind, like the, of how, like the,

38:13.080 --> 38:19.480
of the fact that these, like you're hearing these words and now what happens in your mind as you

38:19.480 --> 38:26.840
hear them, like do you have the, does the mind react with anger or not, and now like if it went

38:27.880 --> 38:32.840
and, and now like even if it's reacting in anger, then if you are aware at that point,

38:32.840 --> 38:36.680
then you're able to stop this, but if you are not aware, then you're not able to stop it,

38:36.680 --> 38:41.480
or if you were kind of aware, if you were more aware, then you can like be able to

38:43.160 --> 38:48.440
not allow the mind to react in anger. So how would you then, how would you then go about being aware,

38:48.440 --> 38:54.920
being aware about being aware of your mind? How would you do that then? How would you then not,

38:54.920 --> 38:59.080
not lose awareness of your mind? So then you don't say something out of carelessness.

39:01.800 --> 39:06.840
Well, if somebody is, but you need to just maintain awareness of your mind, essentially,

39:06.840 --> 39:11.320
something that you need to practice. No, but they say I don't know what awareness of the mind is,

39:11.320 --> 39:17.160
or in other words, it might mean one thing for me, another thing for you. So yeah, how can I understand

39:17.160 --> 39:22.440
what the awareness of the mind is for you? How can I practically do it? I want to be aware of

39:22.440 --> 39:29.160
the mind the way you're describing. How can I go about and do that? Well, it's like not to look

39:29.160 --> 39:36.040
at what you see and what you hear, not that somebody is telling the, is saying these words,

39:36.040 --> 39:41.080
but at that point, you have to maintain awareness of who hears, like what, what is hearing the,

39:41.080 --> 39:49.080
like the, at that place or at that point, like who is, who is hearing, who is speaking,

39:49.080 --> 39:56.360
who is, who is acting or who is, who is listening, like to be, like if you were aware at that point,

39:56.360 --> 40:02.440
now you know, like to know, to know at the point where the words are, where the sound example is

40:02.440 --> 40:07.960
meeting the mind, like because when somebody is saying words about it. So hold on, hold on,

40:07.960 --> 40:13.720
hold on. So if it's about the point where the sound meets the mind, it is about things you see

40:13.720 --> 40:18.520
in here, because you started by saying it's not about things you see in here. But if that's what

40:18.520 --> 40:24.680
you're paying attention, then it is about what you're hearing. No, but what I mean is not to the,

40:24.680 --> 40:31.160
not paying attention to the sound itself, but paying attention to how it is formed in the mind,

40:31.160 --> 40:38.520
like how has it hurt the, like for example, I mean, I cannot give many examples from myself,

40:38.520 --> 40:45.480
like this. Well, it's hurt as an insult. For example, I heard an insult.

40:47.960 --> 40:53.560
So I was aware of hearing the sound entering my ears and everything else, but it was an insult.

40:53.560 --> 40:59.560
So how do I be aware that some not insulted to begin with?

41:02.200 --> 41:09.240
But the point is that it's an insult only if you're like, it's your mind that takes it as an insult,

41:09.240 --> 41:15.880
like I am insulted. But the mind took it already. So how do I not be affected by that? Because everybody

41:15.880 --> 41:23.160
starts by already being insulted, affected, greedy, adverse and so on. So how do I then,

41:23.160 --> 41:31.560
not be affected by the insulted mind? Do I analyze what I heard? What do I do? No. How do I be aware

41:31.560 --> 41:35.240
of it? So I'm not affected over it with by it. Sorry.

41:37.080 --> 41:45.160
I'm not affected by it. It doesn't matter. So let me just get your question straight. So how do you

41:45.160 --> 41:51.160
be aware of the aware of this in the way that you're not affected by this? Yeah, by the mind,

41:51.160 --> 41:58.920
it's insulted. Because what you were describing to me sounds like I'm hoping.

42:01.080 --> 42:04.920
Well, that's that's what I'm trying to get to. Like what you described to, it's like I'm

42:04.920 --> 42:09.880
basically trying to set up this practice whereby I will hopefully not get insulted

42:09.880 --> 42:15.160
by analyzing sounds or or paying attention to who hears or introducing these other questions.

42:15.160 --> 42:18.440
They will sort of maybe deflate the insult. But the fact is,

42:18.440 --> 42:23.000
the people start with an unenlightened mind with a mind that's not free from greedy version

42:23.000 --> 42:28.600
delusion, which means insult will be first, lust will be first, aversion will be first.

42:30.440 --> 42:34.840
So how am I not affected in the first place? Not how will I manage once I'm affected?

42:37.000 --> 42:41.080
How will I, whoever affected now, learn to not be affected by this?

42:41.080 --> 42:49.720
Yeah, so first of all, I mean, I'm not really talking about analyzing the sound or something

42:49.720 --> 43:00.440
like that. This is just on the level of like awareness. But if you're what you're asking is,

43:00.440 --> 43:05.720
so like if you're already affected, then first of all, if you're even if you're already affected,

43:05.720 --> 43:11.240
then at least if you have the if you are aware enough at the at the point of that, like if you're

43:11.240 --> 43:19.080
aware of like being insulted, that the mind that you're insulted, or that you that like this,

43:19.080 --> 43:31.560
this feeling of of being insulted is there, then at least you can decide not to speak based on that.

43:31.560 --> 43:39.560
So like at least then if you were aware of that point of being being insulted, then you can

43:39.560 --> 43:46.440
decide not to speak based on that. But you have to be aware of like of what's going on in your mind

43:46.440 --> 43:53.800
of the like feeling of being insulted that that is there in order to then practice restraint or not.

43:53.800 --> 44:00.760
Okay. But you can also like, but if you like if you under first of there's many

44:01.480 --> 44:06.040
there's different points. How do you not become affected in the in the furthest place? Like I

44:06.040 --> 44:16.360
would say partly, partly is based on kind of developing understanding, like understanding of the

44:16.360 --> 44:29.560
the I mean, this is more specific, but so why then would I need to ask myself, why then would I

44:29.560 --> 44:36.440
need to ask myself who hears and who's offended and what did I hear and what sound and why why is

44:36.440 --> 44:47.800
that relevant? No, but when I say like ask who hears, it's not it's not as a kind of question

44:47.800 --> 44:52.840
that you kind of ask yourself or something to to analyze. It's just as a way of sort of pointing

44:52.840 --> 44:59.320
to the place to be aware like to to. But what's the place? Not looking outside at the sound.

44:59.320 --> 45:06.200
But why would that be relevant? So the sound did offend me. The sound was the problem.

45:09.160 --> 45:13.080
No, the sound is not the problem. The sound is the sound. This is the point like if you.

45:13.080 --> 45:18.040
Then it doesn't really matter. Like what I heard and who heard, it doesn't really, it's irrelevant.

45:18.040 --> 45:24.200
What matters is I'm affected here and now doesn't matter why and who said what and to what extent.

45:24.200 --> 45:31.240
I don't need to pay attention to the words even in that sense. So the problem is not in those things.

45:34.520 --> 45:41.000
So how would you. So then how am I aware of where the problem is? Because when I ask you do this,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.600
you describe the sound and the question and so on. I'm surely meant different, but doesn't matter.

45:44.600 --> 45:49.960
The point is even if you say, oh, you don't really ask a question, you just look for the place.

45:49.960 --> 45:56.360
Why? What place? Is it the place that I'm affected? It means, well, I am already affected. I already

45:56.360 --> 46:01.560
know that. I don't need to look for the place. So what is the problem? Let me put it like that.

46:01.560 --> 46:07.160
What is the problem in being affected? What is the problem in an insult? Is it the words?

46:07.160 --> 46:13.720
Is it the person? Is it the attitude? Even is it my conceit? No, what is the problem there and then

46:13.720 --> 46:23.240
while I'm insulted? What is the problem by being insulted? The fact is that you feel insulted

46:23.240 --> 46:31.800
already. What is the problem of an insult? Sometimes a person can say something to you and you're

46:31.800 --> 46:36.600
not insulted. Sometimes they say the same thing and now you're insulted. What's the difference between

46:36.600 --> 46:46.280
the two? The difference is because example, you can hear the same insulting words from in a movie

46:46.280 --> 46:55.320
example or in another context and now you will not get insulted because it's not because I'm not

46:55.320 --> 47:00.680
insulted. The same context. Not relating to two different contexts which would be two different

47:00.680 --> 47:07.800
experiences, the same experience, same context, same person, same occasion, same habit. Once I

47:07.800 --> 47:12.280
feel insulted, another occasion I don't, which is quite possible. What would be the difference

47:12.280 --> 47:17.480
between the two? It's not the words I hear. It's not even the mindset. I do recognize, look,

47:17.480 --> 47:23.400
he wants to insult me like yesterday. So what would be the difference then between the two?

47:23.400 --> 47:35.480
They want constitutes an issue. Exactly, pain, suffering, unpleasantness that you want to get rid

47:35.480 --> 47:41.720
of. So you want to be mindful, you want to be aware, no need for sensations, no sound,

47:42.360 --> 47:48.040
no self questioning of the psychological nature. All of that will be done inevitably in the beginning

47:48.040 --> 47:53.640
but you need to maintain the sight like the eyes on the prize which is, no fundamentally,

47:54.600 --> 48:00.680
the only reason insult, torture, anything is a problem is because emotionally it's uncomfortable

48:00.680 --> 48:06.360
and I'm habitually resisting it. That's why I suffer. Not because of the words, not because who

48:06.360 --> 48:11.960
hear the words, who is offended, it's because when the experience of disagreeable arises and

48:11.960 --> 48:18.520
yours and this five aggregates, they're describing against it. And without the knowledge of that,

48:18.520 --> 48:23.880
it will be impossible. A person will never arrive at it. It doesn't matter how much management,

48:23.880 --> 48:28.760
how much meditation techniques and repostinars in the colloquial sense of what they do because

48:28.760 --> 48:35.080
it's all revolves around being affected already and missing the point, which means for even to

48:35.080 --> 48:39.880
the slightest degree, you miss that the point of insult is being unpleasant and you resist that,

48:39.880 --> 48:46.440
to that extent you will, at least implicitly assume it's the words, it's the person, it's

48:46.440 --> 48:51.640
something I've done, I wasn't mindful enough, I didn't do this, I didn't have my meditation,

48:51.640 --> 48:56.280
I made all this, I will not do this mistake, all of that is secondary to the fact that no,

48:56.280 --> 49:00.760
presence of craving means presence of suffering, not presence of unpleasant words, unpleasant

49:00.760 --> 49:07.240
actions, unpleasant thoughts. So how would you be aware of that? You realize, oh, by recognizing

49:07.240 --> 49:13.000
where the problem is. So mindfulness, knowledge, go hand in hand, you will not be able to be mindful

49:13.000 --> 49:17.720
of these things unless you start discerning them and you will not be able to discern them,

49:17.720 --> 49:22.680
unless you actually hear about them in that sense. That's why the two factors for the

49:22.680 --> 49:27.880
arising of the right view is the right instruction and the right, the only someone in the car,

49:27.880 --> 49:33.240
the proper type of like knowing what the attention is, so to speak. Because if you just hear my

49:33.240 --> 49:39.000
actual words without a peripheral context of your own experience to which these words apply,

49:39.000 --> 49:44.920
you have no yawning so basis. So you're just attending, literally taking word for word

49:44.920 --> 49:49.400
in mantras and so on, like what people commonly do. All these are just said that, as I said this

49:49.400 --> 49:54.200
and so on. I read the sutas, I study sutas, but peripherally, you want to discern the

49:54.200 --> 50:00.040
context with this applies to you here and now this very moment, which is why this very moment,

50:00.040 --> 50:05.400
the roots of suffering are being maintained by you. And that's exactly how you get even the

50:05.400 --> 50:11.560
confidence that you're not even afraid of what you will hear in the future, what people will do

50:11.560 --> 50:18.840
to you in the future, because the place where the pain is has been uprooted, which is the craving.

50:19.400 --> 50:25.080
So it doesn't really matter what comes this way. The basis of suffering is gone, because suffering

50:25.080 --> 50:29.800
was never in things that were coming through your ears, eyes and so on, not even through your thoughts,

50:29.800 --> 50:35.800
so to speak. It was in your own ignorance of basic, your own attitude towards your own

50:35.800 --> 50:37.960
presently enduring feeling here and now.

50:42.440 --> 50:51.560
Yeah, at this point about, yeah, at this point of, if I can paraphrase generally,

50:51.560 --> 50:56.120
yeah, that you suffer, but mainly what makes it suffering, what makes something suffering,

50:56.120 --> 51:01.160
is because you, because of craving, like what makes anything suffering is because that you

51:01.160 --> 51:07.320
like want to get rid of it or you want, or want something, you are already doing it.

51:08.120 --> 51:12.600
It's not, I want to get rid of it. I am already trying to get rid of it. That's why I already

51:12.600 --> 51:18.280
suffer. It's not on the level of choosing or not choosing. You're already, if you're already

51:18.280 --> 51:25.960
suffering, if you're already affected, you're already getting rid of it. Yeah, and the point

51:25.960 --> 51:33.160
where there was one point that you mentioned, there's like again, just again in regard to the

51:33.160 --> 51:42.040
same example, like hearing, hearing insulting words, there's a, because there's, now you mentioned

51:42.040 --> 51:47.720
unpleasant feeling arises, has arisen that you were trying to get rid of and this is what makes

51:47.720 --> 51:59.000
this painful or suffering, if I got it right. But for somebody who's got rid of craving

52:02.600 --> 52:11.640
and got rid of their self-centered point of view, let's say, how does the unpleasant feeling of

52:11.640 --> 52:19.960
being insulted or right is? How can that be possible? The insult, the disagreeability of it,

52:21.400 --> 52:26.360
but they're not resisting it. What's disagreeing about this? Well, the offensive attitude,

52:26.360 --> 52:30.840
the threatening attitude of the person, perception of that, perception is disagreeable of it.

52:32.120 --> 52:36.040
Like same when the Buddha said, sometimes a monk asking for instruction, he gives him

52:36.040 --> 52:40.600
destruction and he goes and does the opposite. Buddha sees him doing the opposite, not being

52:40.600 --> 52:45.720
restrained and he said, the target is disagreed with that. He experienced a disagreeable feeling,

52:45.720 --> 52:50.120
but that disagreeable feeling cannot overwhelm his mind. In other words, there is no craving in

52:50.120 --> 52:55.960
regard to disagreeability of that perception. It's not that this person who is free from

52:55.960 --> 53:01.880
craving an other hand has no concept anymore of people's behavior or this is threatening,

53:01.880 --> 53:07.640
this is agreeable, this is disagreeable. No, he cannot be affected by it, but agreeability

53:07.640 --> 53:10.120
and disagreeability is still there. And that's the difference.

53:14.040 --> 53:17.160
In the sense that, yes, like something is okay, it's

53:19.000 --> 53:24.360
shouting you, I'm shouting, I'm punching my face, I'm threatening to hate you, I'm calling you names,

53:24.360 --> 53:29.640
all of that is significant, you perceive that, you know what that means. Arran does not lose

53:29.640 --> 53:33.720
the meaning of all these things, but he loses being emotionally overwhelmed by it.

53:33.720 --> 53:39.960
Yeah, you can judge example the behavior that behaves, you can see, okay, if you start to

53:39.960 --> 53:45.480
shout at me and to threaten me and every day, I can see, okay, it's actor out of anger, it's

53:45.480 --> 53:55.720
immoral, it's immoral behavior, but why would it be disagreeable for me?

53:56.280 --> 54:01.880
Like the example or hearing and insulting words is there's no reason for it to be disagreeable for

54:01.880 --> 54:08.680
me? Well, there is no reason to not be disagreeable either, you are not in a choice of how things arise

54:08.680 --> 54:14.840
for you, you just find things agreeing or disagreeing, cold, hot, that's why they would have compared

54:14.840 --> 54:19.720
the words and abuse of others to should be endured like the way you endure the elements, you endure

54:19.720 --> 54:26.840
instincts biting you. Yeah, so you trying why is that disagreeable is basically overstepping

54:26.840 --> 54:31.720
into the domain of nature of perception and trying to why is it like that doesn't matter why.

54:32.600 --> 54:38.120
Only the only thing you can know and you are responsible for is are you resisting the disagreeable?

54:39.160 --> 54:42.520
Are you fearing it? Are you trying to get rid of it? Are you trying to prevent it out of fear and

54:42.520 --> 54:47.320
so on? And are you trying to prolong the agreeable? Are you existentially dependent upon agreeable?

54:47.960 --> 54:53.880
Why is there disagreeable and agreeable? It's basically like asking why the aggregate of

54:53.880 --> 54:59.080
Sankara is there? Why the aggregate of perception is there? That's kind of a meaningless question

54:59.080 --> 55:01.560
because the question is the result of the aggregate being there.

55:05.560 --> 55:11.800
They are not sure because in regard to the like disagreeable things that arise from, because let's

55:11.800 --> 55:25.000
say as let's talk about I mean a sound can be or like a sound can be something that like physically

55:25.000 --> 55:29.160
hearing a sound can be sort of physically painful for the ear like I say a really loud sound.

55:30.600 --> 55:34.600
So it's disagreeable? Physically disagreeable. You don't suffer you don't fear it but it's

55:34.600 --> 55:44.760
disagreeable in itself. So asking why is it disagreeable it's like asking why is there a sound?

55:44.760 --> 55:53.160
It's on the same footing. But what I was going to say is that the like disagreeable from from

55:53.160 --> 55:58.520
hearing words is a bit different because that's not something physical. It's only on the level of

55:58.520 --> 56:05.240
the how the mind how the mind takes it like if it's a because hearing you can hear the same words

56:06.120 --> 56:10.760
based like as I said like you can hear it in itself. You can hear it in itself in a movie.

56:10.760 --> 56:16.840
Right well it's not a word. So it's the context that you're still hearing if you don't hear the

56:16.840 --> 56:23.880
movie the mind will have no context of impersonal insult. So whichever way your mind takes it

56:23.880 --> 56:30.440
it did it boils down to the sound you heard. Again that's why the Buddha said he a skillful

56:30.440 --> 56:36.680
man can do his heat called insect bites abuse of others and so on. It's on the level of elements

56:36.680 --> 56:42.360
besetting you because there is meaning even in meaningless sound so to speak meaning to the point

56:42.360 --> 56:49.000
of disagreeability. That's what it means screeching sound. Agreeability I don't it's nothing specific

56:49.000 --> 56:55.960
there are no words to it but it's still in its very essence it suits or it disturbs that's it

56:56.600 --> 57:00.920
and same with the speech. Obviously speech gets more elaborate because now there's all layers of

57:00.920 --> 57:06.440
meaning of the words in the language and designations but fundamentally none of they would exist if

57:06.440 --> 57:13.240
somebody didn't actually say it. If you didn't hear it so the sound is there still as a basis

57:13.240 --> 57:19.720
and fundamentally doesn't matter how much how much it means positively or negatively what the

57:19.720 --> 57:25.560
person said fundamentally it all remains bound with the sound that you heard the word so it's

57:25.560 --> 57:36.040
agreeable or disagreeable fundamentally pleasing or displeasing but just the point I was trying

57:36.040 --> 57:41.640
to make maybe maybe it doesn't matter but the but that the disagreeable is not in the sound it's

57:41.640 --> 57:47.320
not because of the because of the nature of the sound it's only because of the nature of the meaning

57:47.320 --> 57:51.720
if it's if it's about words that's where you're suffering. Yeah that's the difference between

57:51.720 --> 57:57.240
suffering on account to disagreeable and disagreeable I'm talking about and the disagreeable I'm

57:57.240 --> 58:02.600
talking about is in the sound that you heard that's that's as far as basically your responsibility goes.

58:04.040 --> 58:09.240
You can now over analyze and say it's because they meant this or they meant that but fundamentally

58:09.240 --> 58:17.560
none of that would be even there if you haven't heard it you would not be relevant it would be

58:17.560 --> 58:32.680
like a movie you didn't watch. Yeah and it's quite important what I'm saying is because

58:32.680 --> 58:41.160
if you do divorce agreeability and disagreeability from the perception through your senses it enables

58:41.160 --> 58:47.800
you then to go through the analysis of the sound not in an abstract sense but like who where it came

58:47.800 --> 58:52.920
from separate the meaning which kind of basically feels almost as if you are dealing with the problem

58:52.920 --> 58:58.520
of it but you're not the problem is not that sound is agreeable or disagreeable or neither

58:58.520 --> 59:05.800
maybe it's a neutral sound the problem is that agreeability disagreeability neutrality means basis

59:05.800 --> 59:13.080
for craving for you within you but if you if you are focusing on the relationship between the sound

59:13.080 --> 59:18.120
and disagreeability and why is it disagreeable or why it shouldn't be and the meaning and so on

59:18.120 --> 59:22.920
means you're not dealing with the problem is so it doesn't matter why it's disagreeable what matters

59:22.920 --> 59:29.160
is is they're craving against the disagreeable experiences a whole of somebody saying mean words

59:29.160 --> 59:34.600
to me doesn't matter the individual syllables the words the exit none of that is relevant

59:34.600 --> 59:39.480
who they are is irrelevant why did they say this why do they want to hurt me absolutely

59:39.480 --> 59:43.720
relevant what really that is the experience as a whole is disagreeable and that's what I'm

59:43.720 --> 59:48.920
resisting if I stop resisting the disagreeability the actual violence cannot harm me anymore

59:48.920 --> 59:58.280
so how do you stop what do you mean by resist stopping to resist the disagreeable of it how

59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.000
first see first you need to see exactly so if you think disagreeability is not in the perception

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:09.880
you have misconceived it if you think disagreeability is equals you're suffering you have misconceived

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:15.160
it so you need to see disagreeability of the experience as a whole as a reason phenomena

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:20.760
that you did not necessarily create and you have no say any directly but you are subjected to it

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:26.600
and that's why sensory strength needs to be done beforehand sensory strength that prevents

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:33.160
one's mind from blaming the sound or the person they said or attacking them implying they are

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:40.360
the cause for my suffering so you stop you start restraining then you still try to analyze the

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.920
disagreeable why did I say this why did I react like that maybe I shouldn't do it wasn't mindful

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.920
enough all of that revolves around the fact that you are resisting the disagreeable which means

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:55.880
you're not seeing it you're not seeing it for what it is enduring there but if you start actually if

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:01.960
you stop investing effort in managing the disagreeable and like no disagreeability is present doesn't

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:08.040
matter on account of what and then refrain for as long as it takes from jumping into the management

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:13.320
of the disagreeable then you get to see that all you have is disagreeable disagreeability or

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.880
agreeability and your attitude towards it that's the that's basically the core that's the only

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.920
relevance here that's the gateway for any suffering for any last for any version they will then be

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:30.680
manifested are you welcoming the agreeable are you resisting the disagreeable as a preemptive

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:36.440
attitude pretty much as a view and the only way you can see the view in regard to agreeability

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.520
or disagreeability is to first start seeing agreeability or disagreeability correctly

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:46.360
that's where the Buddha himself said all i'm teaching is suffering like correctly people don't

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:51.800
even know what suffering is all i'm teaching is dukkha and freedom from so i'm actually teaching

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:59.320
you dukkha like the Buddha would say means people like can suffer the utmost the greatest misfortune

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:05.560
and still completely have no idea what actual dukkha is so dukkha and freedom from dukkha

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.440
agreeability and freedom from agreeability disagreeability freedom from disagreeability

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.120
but it needs to be seen for what it is

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:29.160
because even when you have the view that but disagreeability doesn't feel like it's in the words

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:36.440
all of that you have pretty much developed inferred maintained on account of experiencing the disagreeable

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:42.440
words first and then your mind your thinking took you into explaining that it's not in the words

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:49.880
and so on because it was first and it remained first so does he doesn't matter as i said whether

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.840
it's in this this point is experiences a whole of certain words in this particular instance

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.800
felt disagreeable and it was a problem for me and that's why you gave into all these reflections

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.280
basically revolving around trying to together it trying to free yourself from it

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:12.360
yeah but i agree like this is not this is useless like to kind of analyze after the event is like

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:18.280
you're too late like that you already you already was disagreeable was already a problem and now

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:23.000
you say i was only because of the was only because it was only because of the meaning it was not because

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.920
of the words yeah oh that is useless um yeah this uh say agreed

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.560
and then um it's

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:52.040
like a bear related point what if

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.800
because we now we're talking about agreeable and disagreeable but in

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.760
and and like feeling feeling suffering on account of that but what i

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:11.160
like i would say that also like yeah you can talk about it on that level but i mean

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:18.520
there is the kind of additional problem let's say in getting angry about something is

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:25.320
one is that it's like one is that it's disagreeable but i think most people like as a normal person

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.720
when you get angry you don't even kind of notice that it's disagreeable because you're so focusing

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:36.360
on the object of it the anger itself you don't see it as disagreeable so i mean the problem with

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:43.080
anger is is is is more that it's in like on wholesome that it's wrong that it's that it's not

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.400
that it's not good but so like from that point of view

01:04:47.400 --> 01:05:04.440
but like you need to learn to you need to learn to not be it's not get angry in the first place okay

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:18.840
like if you kind of if you are getting if you are getting angry already

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.720
then like if you're getting angry and then kind of saying it's not if you if you allow yourself

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:29.960
to get angry and to continue to get angry and to speak out of anger like in your aim yeah your

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:35.640
aim can be to not get angry in the first place but i would say you kind of have to start by first

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:41.800
not allowing yourself to not not allowing the anger to continue well that's why i say you need

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:48.120
to start restraining yourself first you're not going to see things on the level of your mind if

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.680
you if your physical and verbal actions are not restrained beforehand so you have to stop acting

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:58.600
out of anger you have to stop acting out of lust with a goal of not being affected by it in the

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:06.360
first place so if you're still affected by the first place not acting well restrained but

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:12.600
affected in the first place you still have a massive problem there that's the route yeah

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.600
and it doesn't matter if you're getting affected as much or i'm not getting affected as much no

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:28.520
nature of being affected is something i'm still susceptible to thus it's still the massive problem

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.840
because often what happens when people get into practice they they start cultivating the environment

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:38.760
that suits them which is fine but then they begin they start to depend on that environment whereby

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.080
you you will have a protective environment well you might be the senior monk nobody will be

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:48.760
challenging you offending you questioning you nothing really to poke you around so you don't

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:54.360
really have this anger arising anymore because now you're basically to lower the land everybody's

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.760
your servant so to speak so but that doesn't mean you dealt with it so that's why the buddha

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:03.080
would say so you then ask yourself okay i'm not experiencing any kind of anger but

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:09.480
candy and a reason anger arise for me if you have no idea means yes you got your answer

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.920
so and that should be regarded as the root of the problem not the fact that most of my time

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:20.120
i'm not lastful most of my time i'm not angry that's because of the circumstances or because

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:25.160
you're in our hand which one is it so if person is honest they'll know the answer

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:31.320
but no often often it's regarded as oh dama helps me i don't get angry as much

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:36.360
are you still liable to anger yes that's not the dama that's just your management

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.360
on account of how you took dama to be to be but dama actually will approach it

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:52.520
it means you will be incapable of anger yeah they reminded me of that story with the mistress

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:58.440
vida hika i think another one the the maid servant the mistress was uh supposed to be so

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:17.560
patient and so kind and so she was testing her yeah so so i mean that's yeah that's

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:23.080
i mean i was uh it's it's like i said but it's a good point it's true like this i mean i was wondering

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:29.560
even um because i'm because i'm not involved and i don't i'm not or or none and like we don't

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:37.320
we don't live like that so um so it's kind of interesting kind of interesting way of practicing

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:46.280
here that you like you have kind of plenty of opportunity to see this to see that like anger

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:51.960
can arise or like the that these things can arise you're not in sort of a position where you

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:57.720
uh when you're never being confronted by anybody so in one sense i would say that's

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:02.440
almost a useful thing because you have to kind of be confronted by the by the fact that's

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.400
in a way exactly i think if it can be it can be beneficial for people but that's again that's

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.520
another place for peripheral awareness whichever whichever we want to call it would be handy

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:18.760
which would actually like result in knowledge if people's practice is about current sensations

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.880
in present moment present moment present moment presently i've no lost presently i've no ill will

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:29.160
that's it that's my concern present moment no future present moment should be a concern

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:35.320
on a reason last can it arise oh yeah that's another present moment that i'm obviously

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:40.360
ignoring because i'm so absorbed in present sensations and and present breathing and presently

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:45.880
being here and now you know judgment free or whatever else you know people say apologize

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:53.400
okay that's fine great so environment is suitable you made some effort are you liable to lust

01:09:53.400 --> 01:10:00.200
are you liable to aversion oh and if you are you are presently liable ironically enough

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.840
so you're so absorbed in the present moment that you don't see your present liability

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.320
to the very things you you think you're overcoming

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:14.920
and that's like see the possibility of future lust it's not present there so you cannot attend

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:20.040
to it that's exactly why people have people who are used to this kind of practice of just

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:24.360
just what's in front have problem understanding while you only summon a sicare is the way we describe

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:29.320
it have you know it cannot grasp peripheral because if the moment they think it they make it in the

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:35.240
front but it is there a possibility of future lust it's exactly that see it's an intention

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:40.920
that persists there because you're not free from lust arabhan has no possibility of future lust

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:48.920
no intentions of lust gone uprooted because he has made the effort on that on that right level

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:58.360
understood it okay but yeah this was a this was a point in the video yesterday that I

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:05.560
wanted to ask about anyway so like when you say the possibility of future like the yeah the

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:12.120
possibility of future lust or future sexual desire or future anger

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:22.040
like yeah it's it is there as a possibility and it is a problem which means it's a possibility

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:27.080
of future lust means its current liability and that's a problem

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:34.840
they basically means that you haven't uprooted this like as long as it's there because you

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.440
have not uprooted this yeah you haven't actually yeah you haven't fixed the problem so everything

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.880
else that's around you like oh most of the time I'm not angry most of the time I don't last fool

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.920
that's all circumstantial and should be regarded as such for as long as you don't approach it

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:55.240
that's the true freedom but many people by just focusing on what's in front what's in front is

01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:00.920
that I don't get lustful don't get angry oh I must be free then or something but until you get

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:05.080
lustful or angry then you quickly deal with it and then you say well most of the time I'm fine

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:12.440
but if you're honest you would see being liable to it that's where the problem is rooted so am I

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:17.800
free from that or not if not means most of the time circumstances suit me and they don't challenge

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:25.560
me if that would change my mind would be overwhelmed by those things that I basically think I uprooted

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.800
and you don't want to wait for that to tell you to happen because it will be too late to deal with it

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:40.120
yeah I mean like yeah I see that it's like it's it's a useful it can be like a useful thing to like

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:47.480
ask yourself or to put this kind of pressure on yourself to see okay even if I'm not getting

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.120
angry right now I can get angry or if it's necessary it's not it's not optional it's complete it's

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:58.760
absolutely it's the only gateway towards writer-proofing everything else is management even if all you do

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:05.080
is read the suitors and practice unless it's done through this gateway of liability to Duka

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.960
one way or the other it's going to be on the level of management

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:22.280
okay but the question I had was about like why do you because I mean is Duka not present

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:31.640
anyway now in your current experience if you are like because it's it's present is it not present

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.440
anyway like why do you need to think about the liability for it in the future because that's

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:45.480
what Duka is Duka uneasiness this is that's what it is liability I mean the divine messenger the

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:53.160
Buddha wasn't sick wasn't old and wasn't dead but he recognizes inevitability so if he just focused

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.400
on whether it was present he wouldn't have seen those things as divine messages so you need even

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.840
wisdom to recognize where the problem is let alone to begin dealing with it

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:10.280
then the sense that yeah the fact that you're liable to suffering yeah the fact that you're

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:16.440
liable to suffering if you recognize the liability currently it's currently unpleasant so actually

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.040
Duka is present for everyone who's not free from it from that liability is just that it's not seen

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:28.040
hence the Buddha teaches Duka first and then freedom from it most people won't even see that

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:38.120
liability is a problem I mean yeah like pay when you pay attention to the idea that you are

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:44.120
that you're subject to suffering this isn't unpleasant or this can be this can be unpleasant

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:53.560
that is it just unpleasant but if you don't pay attention to the idea of the fact that

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.760
you can that you will suffer that you will get old that you will get sick that you will die

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.400
you don't pay attention to that then you don't feel that is suffering yeah that's where you need

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:08.760
to start paying attention to it because it is your reality it's unavoidable you can choose to not

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.960
pay attention to things that are avoidable but it's unwise thing to not pay attention to things that

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:19.480
are unavoidable the divine messages I mean yeah if you don't pay attention to side sound smell

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:24.200
taste touches they bother you they'll stop bothering you the fact is you can be bothered

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:29.320
and you will be bothered first so you choosing to not pay attention is you choosing to ignore the

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:37.000
problem I mean if you if you don't accept that you are ill you'll think you're healthy yeah

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:45.000
and that is pretty much the common world sort of way of dealing with a problem just ignore it just

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.800
ignore the problem it's not there don't pay attention to it absorb yourself either in the

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.920
australis or souls of feet or where the chair touches you or something don't pay attention to

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.840
your current liability of your existence because it's just too overwhelming

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.920
and what do you mean exactly by like paying attention it should I mean you have the idea that

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:15.800
I will suffer in the future okay so like then and I can remember you um inside of the video

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.040
yesterday like you don't need to keep you don't need to keep paying attention to the idea and

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:28.120
keep paying attention to that idea if if the mind is liable to like just ignore the problem

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.240
but once you become aware of the problem you start feeling that concern that dukkha

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.120
then you don't have to keep paying attention to it in the same sense of oh am I like because now

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:43.160
you feel it that you are liable and you already know so what you feel becomes pretty much the

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:48.920
exemplification of your knowledge of your situation and that's exactly what I said if a person does

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:56.520
feel dukkha correctly there are only two possible outcomes madness or noble search there is no

01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:02.120
third possibility if dukkha is seen correctly mind will either go mad if he cannot deal with it

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:09.720
or if he has enough composure it will seek how do I approve this and most people never even allow

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.240
that choice to manifest even the ones they commit to the practice of dama and so on

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:19.560
it's all down on the level of management of the current disturbances not on the level of

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:35.480
uprooting my fundamental liability sickness aging death

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.720
so i'm just trying to um

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.400
like yeah so in the beginning you from from the beginning you need to recognize that you're

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.320
that that's yet that you that you need to recognize that yeah this is like to get the

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:17.080
to start practicing from the beginning with the right attitude it should be this like you have

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:22.360
to know that you are sick in order to see the doctor to like otherwise yeah if you if you don't

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.120
know that you are sick if you don't feel that you are sick you don't go to you don't go

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.120
don't go to see the doctor

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.160
um but like what is still not that clear for me is like the

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.160
uh

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:49.480
because then i mean they then you start to then you have to start to practice right so

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:55.880
like what i'm trying to understand what the practice is what is the what the practice is

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:02.600
is yeah well that's if you start living if you start living within the recognition of your

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.520
pretty much perpetual liability to do cut pray to suffering as everybody would say

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:13.400
and not give into like psychologizing managing trying to explain to yourself so you don't suffer

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:20.600
as much you will then abandon that which is basically liable to that to that suffering so

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:25.000
you would then and that's where this this all the other talks we did on the sense of ownership

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.280
and nature seeing correctly that's where it applies not on the level of explanation of the

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.600
world is often oh yes the modern science has said everything is impermanent the Buddha has said

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:41.000
see modern science and down my it's the same no first you need to feel that existential liability

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.080
and then recognize that on nature and then give up that because of which you suffer

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.520
give up your self-centeredness give up the dependence on pleasure all the upadhanas the Buddha talk

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:57.720
about but only on the basis of that framework of i am liable and this needs to be uprooted

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:04.280
because otherwise if you take it you don't take it on that basis sorry if you don't take it on that

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.600
basis it will be taken through the attitude of management of the disturbance of suffering

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:18.040
not the uprooting of the liability to it

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:27.800
yeah i mean like what i was talking about was more about the

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:33.640
and like i i like i agree like you're trying to just managing and not kind of

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:38.760
not have things that are disagreeable to you is uh like not to be not to

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:45.240
yeah not not to like suffer so much or not to it's it's no use i mean example that like you will

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.800
always just try to get away from the things that are disagreeable but you won't like uh you won't

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:55.480
try to remove the things that are agreeable so the management of restoring to is not it's not necessarily

01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:01.720
it's not like a choice or people choose i will manage it's basically the yeah the the default

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:08.680
result if you are not operating within the recognition of liability to suffering

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:14.120
if you are not operating within framework of that existential anxiety you are managing your

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:20.920
suffering even unknowingly things you do will be on the level of management not uprooting it because

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:25.480
you have well either have no recognition or have fallen from the recognition of that general

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:35.000
anxious nature of your situation duka anise disease not duka or is bothering me that's all

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:50.760
secondary to it yeah yeah yeah because i mean duka is if it's only when something is bothering

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:56.440
you then it's very easy you can just try to find the you people it's not it's not really it's

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:01.720
the problem the problem is not that people haven't heard enough of dama or haven't read enough of

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:08.440
the suitors the problem is that pretty much none of them like all the people they practice but without

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:14.040
actual becoming arhans and so on means something's wrong there and it's not that there was lack of

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:19.000
teachings or lack of suitors or Buddhist instruction or that it's not clear enough is that they never

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.880
ever heard or learned on what level it needs to be applied and it was always stayed within the

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:31.320
framework of management unknowingly so that's what i mean you have to stay within that recognition

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.680
of that liability prey to suffering which is pretty much the framework of anxiety

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:43.720
so that's why people would go mad if they stay on that level and often would like or quickly

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.680
manage it because yeah they don't know any other way so you need to censor strain virtue is what

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:59.640
will prevent you from going mental okay so there's two things now you've said here you said that

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:05.720
censor straight and like morality is what prevents you from going mental and you said there's

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.680
he will prevent you going mad on account of anxiety he will not approve the anxiety

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.080
yeah then you can approve the eventually

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:31.000
yeah and to put in like basically from from if i if i understand well like if you if you

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.880
to practice correctly if you want if you practice directly and then you have to be always practicing

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:45.000
with a view basically to the aim of of getting out of suffering yeah like this has to be the aim

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:54.440
caught looking the liability yeah like this this is what i this is what i understand like that you

01:23:54.440 --> 01:24:02.680
have to like this is your the aim should be always at every moment and it's not exactly but it's not

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:08.200
it's not an abstract aim in a sense it's not like oh i must keep this thought in my mind it's it's

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:16.360
the anxious aim it's the aim you feel anxiety remains there liable to it the aim is there outlined

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:21.080
you don't need to think it anymore in that sense what's my aim what is my aim but unless you have

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:26.760
uncovered the liability of that's anxious in its nature then you have to drill and drill until you

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:40.760
learn what dukkha is first yeah so they first like well about like making this aim clear and then

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.880
taking your actions in order to bring taking every action or taking every practice in order to bring

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:56.040
your closer to this aim this is correct this is i clear about um then feeling like do you mean that

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:03.080
you should have to feel anxious constantly in practicing or no what you don't have to be like

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:08.440
uh sort of trying to contrive anxiety but if you're thinking correctly you will feel uneasy to what

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.160
extent that uneasiness will be a threatening anxiety and fear or not depends to what extent

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:18.760
you've basically developed your seal and are able to hold it but the recognition of the peril is

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:25.160
is the i mean part of understanding the danger is part of freeing yourself from sensuality from the

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:31.240
world from the aggregates from everything so the danger is still there i don't see it but yes

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:37.880
how dangerous that danger is for you it's basically how how much you have understood it or not but

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:43.400
it's still the same danger so initially it's probably going to be very frightening and very anxious

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:51.080
but if you don't act out of it don't break the sealer sensory strength and that strength that

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:57.800
you've accumulated through basic controlling your output your behavior then you can actually well

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:03.000
you you will be able like anxiety is a problem when it's threatening when you when there is a risk

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.600
of being overwhelmed by it if you have sustained it long enough if there is less and less risk for

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:16.440
that danger to overwhelm you but you and then you get to see it even clearer ah the peril the danger

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:22.200
becomes apparent and when the danger is apparent you have abandoned any passion towards that which

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:27.800
is dangerous so that means completely not abstract or on the level of

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:34.840
theories of figuring it out it's actually felt the danger is felt first and then you not being

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:40.280
liable to that same danger is also felt which is when ah the danger becomes apparent thus the

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:49.160
freedom becomes apparent from it so how much you're going to feel anxiety and when in what

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:55.640
process depends pretty much on how much samadhi who have developed how well your virtue has been

01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:01.400
established and how intense is your current recognition of samadhi or sorry of anxiety of

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:08.040
liability to suffering sometimes will be more something will tell you have good days bad days

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:13.000
but that is that is the the field where you have to do the work it's not optional that's what i'm

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.960
saying how much you're going to suffer or come with this option that's what i said sometimes

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:24.200
for some monks practice is pleasant with pleasant results painful with pleasant results and so on

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.400
but it's the same thing it's not like oh i have this approach or that approach it's just

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.240
some minds are stronger they will suffer less on account of the threat because they have more

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:41.960
composure samadhi some minds are not that strong so they'll suffer more that's what exactly put the

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:48.200
who who practiced through the persona not samadhi as much his way was unpleasant and long

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:53.720
but then yeah he was the second to the Buddha in terms of the foremost wisdom

01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:01.000
but if you start actually practicing rightly even the unpleasant way you will recognize

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.240
the liberating aspect of it so you will have no problem in basically enduring that anxiety and

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:14.280
doesn't matter how big it gets and how threatened it is but in order to get there you need to start

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:19.320
rightly and that will be hard for somebody who hasn't been practicing on that level

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:32.680
so be just if i so i don't understand well what you're saying you say there's you have to like

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:39.640
you have to feel anxious feel anxiety feel suffering feel the suffering in the sense that you

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:47.640
are that you do over like in a that you have no control over your over your life and that you will

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:51.240
get old and that you will get sick and that you will die no matter what you do and all of this

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:58.360
um so you have to start like start from this point in order to have like the in order to like

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:05.400
keep the have the aim and then keep the aim of keep the right context as a basis yeah for the

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:12.120
correct direction if you practice yeah and that's what i mean that's why people don't keep that

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:17.320
right context not because they choose something it's because they don't want to feel that discomfort

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.720
it's not an abstract course that they make or some like a little mistake because they

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:33.560
didn't have enough information no it's existentially avoiding the recognition that you are within the

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:40.600
perilous situation without any means of escape and that's very frightening that's essentially fear

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:45.800
of death in the nacho all the people are not necessarily even my colleague that way you'll be

01:29:45.800 --> 01:30:13.240
aware of it it cut out there at for um for a moment um can you hear me now sure oops okay okay um

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:21.160
so yeah so just cut there a little bit the last part i heard was um that you were saying how when

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:26.760
people like start by the wrong on the wrong start on the wrong footing essentially or they don't

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:33.480
practice rightly it's because of um basically because of ignoring ignoring this fact there's

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.880
ignore yeah ignoring your which means you can always fix it nor you can always fix your footing

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:43.640
at any given time you can always fix that you can always restart and reestablish the right framework

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:49.080
but the thing is the more you give in to ignoring it because it's fundamentally frightening and

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:54.680
unpleasant the more you drift away and more incapable of accepting it you are because the

01:30:54.680 --> 01:31:00.680
more the more effort in trying to outrun it you invested so theoretically anybody can become

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:08.280
an Idaho at any stage of life but practically if you spend 20 30 years more avoid in this and even

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:14.360
practicing while avoiding it it would be virtually impossible for you after all that invested effort

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:18.920
to basically just wipe your slate clean and re-accept that fundamental liability that will

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:23.720
fill you with anxiety and make you like back onto the day one i mean people won't do that in for

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:29.640
mundane things let alone for something so profound and hard to approach such as you know existential

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:43.000
anxiety yeah i mean that's why i mean i think most people they don't really practice with the

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:48.280
with the for that for the aim of the of the of the goal really they don't

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:54.840
but they don't be practiced for another reason or for like wanting to like basically wanting to

01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:01.640
feel better or to and there is no if they don't practice with that as a basis the right basis

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:06.920
they don't practice dama even if it's the dama they're doing i mean the buddha said himself only yeah

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:12.920
like he he's teaching has only one taste like the ocean has only one taste of salt taste the

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:19.240
freedom from suffering nothing else so suffering freedom from it is the only place where dama can be

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:24.120
so i mean it's an option not it's not oh let me choose this or choose that

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:34.760
it's the only way um

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:44.120
there was maybe just one more i i'm i'm aware of taking up a lot of your your time already um

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:54.200
um and i would just like to maybe to ask on one more one more point

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:10.120
a bit or two so like if i can kind of summarize basically the like overall the the different

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:18.600
points that are mentioned um so from the beginning you have to start like with uh

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:24.280
recognizing that you're sick like the recognizing that you you're what the nature of your problem is

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:30.120
and then you have to like make the aim clear a bit like if you're not practicing with the

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:35.080
realization that you're sick and like we needing to be healed then you're not practicing right

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:40.680
you have to resist the temptation to not to manage the symptoms at the expense of the recognition

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:45.800
of your illness that's still there even if you remove the symptoms yeah but am i still alive yeah

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:53.000
thus i'm still ill so don't get complacent even when things don't bother you and suddenly don't

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:01.080
make your practice revolve around dealing with things that bother you only yeah yeah so i mean

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:06.680
don't look just for a painkiller basically like you want to go to the you you want to go to see

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:11.960
that go to a doctor yeah if the pain is too much take the painkiller but don't forget that

01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:15.800
fundamentally the only reason you needed to take the painkiller and the head pain is because

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:22.520
you're still sick there's still the underlying illness yeah yeah and as long as you haven't cured

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:28.200
the underlying illness then actually you can you can continue to take painkillers but the illness

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.960
is still there and it's getting worse exactly and now you don't even have the symptoms to tell you

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:40.120
how worse it is yeah yeah exactly so it's a it's a big problem i agree like

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.520
because you can feel so kind like you can you can make yourself feel very calm by just like

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.760
concentrating on the breath or something like that and you can spend hours a day just concentrating on

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:55.720
sensation of breathing and now you feel so much better and you think everything's going so much

01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:00.920
better is you think you're fine so now you stop like searching for a way out because you think

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:06.200
you're fine yeah that's that's what i said in other talks like most of like today's meditation

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.280
Buddhist meditation practice is just calming techniques which is fine if you need to calm down

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:15.240
but don't confuse that for samadhi there will result in panya and complete wisdom and liberation

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:27.880
yeah and then like the other point is then about like what what is the like once you once you know

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:32.520
what you're what you're doing then what does the practice consist of at one point you said morality

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:41.320
is to stop yourself from going mad um i don't know if i have seen this uh

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:49.640
uh like i think morality is essential like it's a essential base of of practicing morality is

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:55.720
in the sense of like no not having any wrongdoing in in thoughts words or actions

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:10.760
and then new payer what you were what you were talking about what you were saying is that

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:18.440
basically you um you need to kind of realize that's the problem like understand where the problem is

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:26.600
in the sense that you that you can become affected by anger or that you can become that you become

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:35.240
greedy or that you are that you are or having desire for things in the first place and not to

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:42.760
just like want to kind of manage these things when they arise so this point is okay um

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:53.960
and yeah so then the and then the correct practice like to what yeah what what kind of

01:36:53.960 --> 01:37:01.960
still is like i'm kind of trying to figure it out is the if you're if you're practicing

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:08.040
rightly like if you if you if you practice if you if you practice correctly

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.280
then you should see that you're practicing correctly right so there's no need to have the

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:20.600
same anxiety of uh that was there in the beginning if you know that you're practicing rightly yeah

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:25.800
if you're not so see you're not ignoring your liability to suffer you're not ignoring the

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.120
peril you're not turning a blind eye you're not distracting yourself from it and it doesn't

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:36.440
bother you as much now because you pretend it's not there because you get used to it

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.200
anxiety will stop bothering you when you get used to it

01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:46.600
when you are able to maintain composure in the face of it and the only way to do that is to

01:37:46.600 --> 01:38:02.440
train composure in the face of anxiety and to come back just to just come back to the beginning

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.560
about the because you were telling the base of like the base of being able to practice

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:14.440
mindfulness correctly is to have the the right kind of awareness to be able to

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:21.960
uh have awareness correctly which um is not about just uh like paying attention to sensation

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:27.960
or paying attention to sound or paying attention to something else nor is it about like analyzing

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:40.520
your thoughts or analyzing your uh like experience and so now you were um so now you said the periphery

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:48.760
meaning the like what you said was the basis for that for on which you're paying attention

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:53.160
periphery means the background the background of whatever is currently attended in there so

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:59.640
the the mind is the background in itself the intentionality the possibilities as we described

01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:03.800
that's already the background in itself so it's that's that's what peripheral is

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:11.560
okay it's it can sound technical and i think in those years we use it for the sake of the context

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:17.800
but it's really the background of your currently engaged experience that you don't want to make

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:24.920
into a foreground because then again the point is not what is the foreground or what is the

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:30.120
background the point is to be aware of the background while there is whatever action

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:35.720
intention presently and during feeling and so on in the foreground and that background is literally

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.560
the knowledge of that situation nothing else no sensations no nothing specific that's why it's

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:47.960
so hard to see because it's nonspecific and what else is nonspecific what the nature of things is

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:57.560
nonspecific the nature of this specific cup the nature of this specific object is nonspecific

01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.280
from the point of view of the specific object to which that object kind of pertains to

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:08.600
and that's that's in essence done the nature of things so it's always found in that background

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:09.560
where the knowledge is

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:19.960
so that's what i mean oh specifically there is a

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:26.440
not where the knowledge is yeah where the knowledge is yeah specifically there is an insult

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:34.200
an angry voice everything all of that is quite specific not specifically there is a presence

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:40.040
of suffering that i'm resisting nonspecifically there is discomfort there are many different

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:46.040
nonspecific ways you can take but it will be the same nature of this experience so fundamentally

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:51.000
the problem here is not what's being said what's being heard not even what's being felt yeah the

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.480
problem is that within this basically experience the whole i'm resisting it and i have a view

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.520
that i should not suffer that i'm in control and i should not suffer that's all implicit

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:09.640
so that's the nature of that experience that is the background that is the the vessel in which you

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:16.280
and that's where you get you get insulted when you hear something immediately because the framework

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:22.840
ready for insult is already there in other words framework ready to resist any form of discomfort

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:52.680
that comes through the senses is already there currently maintained by you
