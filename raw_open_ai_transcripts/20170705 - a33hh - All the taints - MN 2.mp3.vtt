WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.520
I'm going to discuss the right attention, you only saw Manisikara, the Buddha praises

00:24.520 --> 00:35.800
this quality many, many times. It's essential in the practice. Yeah, it's one of the prerequisites

00:35.800 --> 00:43.120
for the right view as well, one out of two. And he says, because I do not see even a single

00:43.120 --> 00:51.200
thing that so causes unarisen wholesome qualities to arise and unholesome qualities to decline

00:51.200 --> 00:57.800
as right attention for one who attends carefully, unarisen wholesome qualities arise and

00:57.800 --> 01:03.880
arisen unholesome qualities. He says, one who attends properly. So, one who attends

01:03.880 --> 01:07.920
not careful, because people who think all they need to do is be careful and they'll

01:07.920 --> 01:13.680
see the truth. Now, you actually need to know where you're supposed to attend, thus

01:13.680 --> 01:24.320
attend properly. Rightly. Rightly, exactly. Attendly, rightly. And there are these two conditions

01:24.320 --> 01:31.880
for arising of right view, the utterance of another and proper attention. These are the

01:31.880 --> 01:47.400
two conditions. And we need to use these speaks about the pathages, depends on origination.

01:47.400 --> 01:55.480
He uses that proper attention, explained it to that. Now, I'll just give one example.

01:55.480 --> 02:09.120
This can be found in the connected discourses, some Utanika. Because before my enlightenment,

02:09.120 --> 02:15.880
while I was still a Bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me. Alas,

02:15.880 --> 02:21.960
this world has fallen into trouble in that it is born, ages and dies. It passes away

02:21.960 --> 02:28.960
and is reborn. Yet it does not understand the escape from the suffering, headed by aging

02:28.960 --> 02:36.680
in death. When now, will an escape be discerned from the suffering, headed by aging in death?

02:36.680 --> 02:43.000
Then because it occurred to me, when what exists, does aging in death come to be? By what

02:43.000 --> 02:50.280
is aging in death, determined? Then because, to proper attention, they took place in me

02:50.280 --> 02:57.720
a breakthrough by wisdom. When there is birth, aging in death comes to be. Aging in death

02:57.720 --> 03:05.120
has birth as its determination. So, through proper attention, it took place in me a breakthrough

03:05.120 --> 03:20.040
by wisdom. So, as pretty much every other sutra, people can either read it, kind of

03:20.040 --> 03:27.520
superficially, so to speak, and then read that passage as, okay, so he, the Buddha properly,

03:27.520 --> 03:31.600
you know, he was careful attending, he was really thinking about it, and then he figured

03:31.600 --> 03:39.520
it out. Because, yeah, it can read like that. But if you actually take every sutra to be

03:39.520 --> 03:44.360
a phenomenological description of the nature of experience, nature of things, thus, if

03:44.360 --> 03:51.880
I understood, a person would be at least a sotapana, if not more. Well, in that case, you

03:51.880 --> 03:56.280
would approach that quite differently. So, if he says, so if he was the Yonisamanaseka

03:56.280 --> 04:01.720
there, which he did, if he used the same term, that proper attention or the right attention

04:01.720 --> 04:12.240
means, proper attention is that, which reveals the timeless principle of the teaching father.

04:12.240 --> 04:22.320
And it reveals the principle of dependent origination, the principle, that basically has its two

04:22.320 --> 04:30.600
factors that are simultaneously present, because it says, with what as condition has this,

04:30.600 --> 04:37.240
well, with what as condition is aging in death being manifest. Because, you know, you

04:37.240 --> 04:48.320
are aging and dying simply by being alive. So, what is the simultaneously present condition

04:48.320 --> 04:53.040
for that state? It's the fact that you are manifested in this human existence. That's

04:53.040 --> 05:01.640
what birth is. Birth is not coming out of womb. Birth is manifesting. Manifestation of

05:01.640 --> 05:05.760
the father aggregates the ure appropriating. And that starts when the Buddha, the Buddha

05:05.760 --> 05:12.680
said himself, that starts when an embryo is conceived. It's already, one is already manifested

05:12.680 --> 05:19.240
into this human realm. So, what we take to be birth coming out of womb in a hospital

05:19.240 --> 05:27.160
is just like one of the stages, one of the aspects of that manifestation. But there wouldn't

05:27.160 --> 05:32.240
be coming out of womb if there was no embryo conceived in the first place. So, the birth

05:32.240 --> 05:39.240
takes place when the five aggregates manifest, when the five aggregates a bound, sorry, when

05:39.240 --> 05:46.040
the one to be bound is present and mother and father come together and mother is in season.

05:46.040 --> 05:50.000
And then embryo is conceived. Embryo, there is the five aggregates. And that's what birth

05:50.000 --> 05:56.120
is. And that embryo, when it's conceived simultaneously with its conception or rather

05:56.120 --> 06:02.200
simultaneously with its manifestation, another thing that manifests simultaneously to that

06:02.200 --> 06:12.760
is aging in death. Because growing of the embryo, it's already aging. It's already dying

06:12.760 --> 06:22.960
because it's manifested. So, it's a simultaneous presence of manifestation aging in death. So,

06:22.960 --> 06:34.200
that is the important thing to understand. With dependent origination, it's not the explanation

06:34.200 --> 06:45.400
of causality because every dependent origination description starts with this, this is. So,

06:45.400 --> 06:51.240
with two aspects, one, the determine is the other, but both are present. Simultaneous

06:51.240 --> 06:57.280
is the present. That's what means it doesn't involve time. It's a carlica. It's timeless.

06:57.280 --> 07:04.120
It doesn't involve time. Things that don't involve time are the ones that, like, in their

07:04.120 --> 07:12.800
relationship, are the ones that are simultaneously present to the same extent. And that's what

07:12.800 --> 07:21.720
proper attention shows you. With this, this is. So, that's why, if somebody has a right

07:21.720 --> 07:28.720
view, all they need to do is practice proper attention because all they need to do is just

07:28.720 --> 07:35.960
bring back to the mind that Simultaneous Principle of dependent origination. And they will bring

07:35.960 --> 07:47.520
all the lust to fade. All aversion to fade. All ignorance to fade. Because there's whatever

07:47.520 --> 07:53.960
he attends to. And he attends rightly when they fall. Yeah, whatever he attends to, he

07:53.960 --> 07:59.840
attends rightly. He attends properly. He attends according to its nature. And that nature

07:59.840 --> 08:12.240
is, it is determined. It is impermanent. With this, this is. I'll read the, my, my, my

08:12.240 --> 08:30.640
Jimmy Kaya. Number two, all the tanks. Because this goes into using proper attention. Sure.

08:30.640 --> 08:37.640
So this is the Sabah. Sabah, Sabah, Sabah, Sutta, all the tanks. Because I shall teach

08:37.640 --> 08:42.400
you a discourse on the restraint of all the tanks. Listen and take closely to what I

08:42.400 --> 08:48.720
shall. Say, yes, venable servant, because you play it. The best of unsaid this. Because

08:48.720 --> 08:53.680
I say that the destruction of the tanks is for one who knows and sees. Not for one who

08:53.680 --> 08:59.680
does not know and see. Means it's first, at least sort of one for this. Who knows and

08:59.680 --> 09:07.040
sees what? Proper attention and unproperate attention. Exactly. The one attends properly.

09:07.040 --> 09:16.080
Unarisen tanks, one one attends unproperly, improperly, improperly. Unarisen tanks arise

09:16.080 --> 09:23.500
and arisen tanks increase. When one attends properly, unarisen tanks do not arise and arisen

09:23.500 --> 09:40.200
tanks are abandoned. The tanks are three central, central desire being in English. Because

09:40.200 --> 09:46.280
there are tanks that should be abandoned by seeing. There are tanks that should be abandoned

09:46.280 --> 09:58.580
by restraining, by using, by enduring, by avoiding, by removing and by developing. So

09:58.580 --> 10:06.820
it goes into each of those. Tains to be abandoned by seeing. What tanks should be abandoned

10:06.820 --> 10:13.420
by seeing? Here because an untought ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and

10:13.420 --> 10:19.340
is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dharma, who has no regard for true man and is unskilled

10:19.340 --> 10:24.180
and undisciplined in their Dharma, does not understand what things are fit for attention

10:24.180 --> 10:29.020
and what things are unfit for attention. Since that is so, he attends to those things

10:29.020 --> 10:35.100
unfit for attention and he does not attend to those things fit for attention. What other

10:35.100 --> 10:39.500
things unfit for attention that he attends to, they are things such that when he attends

10:39.500 --> 10:47.420
there, the unarisened taint of central desire arises, the taint of being arises and the taint

10:47.420 --> 10:57.620
of ignorance arises. These are the things unfit for attention that he attends to. And

10:57.620 --> 11:11.220
the opposite, when he knows what he is doing, but the untought ordinary person also attends

11:11.220 --> 11:18.300
in this improper way. He thinks himself, was I in the past? Was I not in the past? Was

11:18.300 --> 11:26.860
I in the past? How was I in the past? See, that is the crucial difference. Improper

11:26.860 --> 11:39.380
attention is the attention that carries the sense of self, carries the notion of I in.

11:39.380 --> 11:47.940
Proper attention is the attention that leaves no room for the sense of self. If you properly

11:47.940 --> 11:53.980
attend, if you say, with this, this is, there is no room for the owner of either this

11:53.980 --> 12:00.060
or this, or this or that, or in between the two. There is just no room for it. It is with

12:00.060 --> 12:06.780
the rising of this, this also arises. Or rather with this, when this is present, this is

12:06.780 --> 12:15.660
present too. So basically, fundamentally, you can take your experience as a whole and

12:15.660 --> 12:25.620
you can see that it is utterly, completely determined by the presence of life. You can

12:25.620 --> 12:33.300
say that. You are alive, thus, whatever you experience is because you are still alive.

12:33.300 --> 12:41.940
Whatever you are experiencing, no matter how it differs particularly, the nature of experience

12:41.940 --> 12:47.860
is there because life is still present. So you can, you can then just reflect further and

12:47.860 --> 12:53.900
see, okay, well, are you in control of that life? Are you in control of the beating heart?

12:53.900 --> 12:58.340
Are you in control of functional brain? Are you in control of preventing accidents

12:58.340 --> 13:05.900
from happening? You are not. Thus, this life that is present rests upon the foundations

13:05.900 --> 13:11.940
that are utterly inconceivable, inaccessible to you. And when you fully understand that,

13:11.940 --> 13:17.700
then you cannot possibly regard it as yours. So that is what proper attention penetrates.

13:17.700 --> 13:25.180
It descends that there are foundations that undermine you that you cannot access. So basically,

13:25.180 --> 13:32.220
it restores the right order of things. Whereby, with this, this is. That is the right order.

13:32.220 --> 13:40.900
For protrusion, it is with me, my experience is. I am thus things are for me, things are mine.

13:40.900 --> 13:49.180
It is actually other way around. So that is exactly why it says, like somebody who is a

13:49.180 --> 13:57.100
protrusion, an uninstructed world, who doesn't know how to attend to things properly. That

13:57.100 --> 14:01.980
is why he ends up wandering these things. Because in the past, was I not? Was I not?

14:01.980 --> 14:07.780
Will I be in the future? How I will be. How I will be. All of that revolves around the fact

14:07.780 --> 14:17.340
that he completely taken for granted that he is. So now, now he is just wondering, how

14:17.340 --> 14:23.540
easy was he all the time? But he never questions that, hold on, even the question of, what

14:23.540 --> 14:28.540
am I, who am I, when I was, how I was? That all revolves around the present notion of

14:28.540 --> 14:35.100
control. Which means he is not properly attending to the nature of experience, and he doesn't

14:35.100 --> 14:39.620
see it as impermanent. And seeing it as impermanent means seeing it as not in your control.

14:39.620 --> 14:51.260
I mean, have doubts arising? Yes, of course. Because basically, he makes himself viable to

14:51.260 --> 15:01.340
add doubt. He doesn't recognize that any of those questions, no matter what the particular

15:01.340 --> 15:06.060
thing that they might be asking is, all those questions in the nature revolve around the

15:06.060 --> 15:11.900
notion of sense of self. And that's all the mistake. Thus he'll then just doubt, because

15:11.900 --> 15:17.780
none of the answers can be satisfied. Was I, yes it was, yes, but was I always? Well, I

15:17.780 --> 15:23.140
don't know. Will I be? Well, I don't know that either. Am I now? Am I not now? How am I

15:23.140 --> 15:30.300
now? All those, oh, it's just just permutations of the same assumption. But he goes beyond

15:30.300 --> 15:39.420
doubt. He attends rightly. He goes beyond doubt if he basically, well, if he's basically

15:39.420 --> 15:46.900
not concerned with those questions, because they're rooted in a mistake in assumptions.

15:46.900 --> 15:52.860
So if he attends rightly, he addresses the mistaken assumptions of sense of control, permanence

15:52.860 --> 16:01.020
and I am. By dissolving that, everything that was depending upon it, namely those questions,

16:01.020 --> 16:09.460
cannot remain. So he doesn't answer the questions. So the one who basically makes them cease. He's

16:09.460 --> 16:19.140
understanding makes all the questions cease. He goes beyond doubt. This is, after that, a

16:19.140 --> 16:23.820
well-thought, noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones and he's skilled and disciplined

16:23.820 --> 16:28.820
in their dhamma, who has regard for true men and he's skilled and disciplined in their dhamma,

16:28.820 --> 16:34.300
understands what things are for attention and what things are unfit for attention. Since

16:34.300 --> 16:38.900
that is so, he does not attend to think those things unfit for attention and he attends

16:38.900 --> 16:48.700
those things unfit for attention. And this is the way he attends. This is suffering. He

16:48.700 --> 16:54.500
attends properly. This is the origin of suffering. He attends properly. This is the cessation

16:54.500 --> 17:01.060
of suffering. This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering. When he attends properly

17:01.060 --> 17:08.140
in this way, three fetters are abandoning him. The personality of you, doubt, and adherence

17:08.140 --> 17:15.300
to rules and observances. These are called the tains that she would abandon thusly. This

17:15.300 --> 17:21.900
is interesting because he's saying he's a noble disciple who attends in this way properly,

17:21.900 --> 17:29.100
the four noble truths, but then when he does this, he reaches the fruit of sort of life.

17:29.100 --> 17:36.300
Yeah, because in that other sort that there is a distinction before a person becomes

17:36.300 --> 17:42.700
sort upon, he gets a pain to the right view. So, Dhammanusari, Sadhanusari. So, he's

17:42.700 --> 17:48.620
not sort upon a yet, but his view is basically now along the right lines, which means he knows

17:48.620 --> 17:54.540
what the proper attention is. So, as that very passage says, when he practices it, he comes

17:54.540 --> 18:00.100
to understand this suffering, this is the origin, this is the cessation, this is the way

18:00.100 --> 18:07.060
that he's got. But those are four things, so four noble truths, but they're basically

18:07.060 --> 18:15.700
all revolving around the same insight, insight into freedom from suffering. So, fully understanding

18:15.700 --> 18:23.300
all the aspects of that can be put into four noble truths. You understand what it is. You

18:23.300 --> 18:30.340
understand what it makes you be. You understand what it makes you not be. And then you understand

18:30.340 --> 18:45.140
the way that leads out of it. And again, you can connect that to what we just said before.

18:45.140 --> 18:51.380
Appropriating your own life, your own body, your own experience, regarding it is yours.

18:51.380 --> 18:58.220
That makes you liable to suffering. Even if you don't necessarily suffer on the immediate

18:58.220 --> 19:03.660
level, like even if there is nothing unpleasant bothering you, the fact that you are appropriate

19:03.660 --> 19:07.820
to these things means there is always a looming possibility of suffering, and that in

19:07.820 --> 19:17.380
itself is suffering. And that's what he recognizes. This is suffering. So, since

19:17.380 --> 19:27.940
itself, I am cannot stand on its own. It always needs, and actually, it's founded upon

19:27.940 --> 19:34.100
a foundation, a relationship. It's founded upon a relationship with the world. And that

19:34.100 --> 19:43.460
relationship is for me, mine. But when you recognize them, that your sense of self depends

19:43.460 --> 19:49.100
upon the world. And when I say the world, I mean experience as a whole. I mean, your

19:49.100 --> 19:54.100
sights, your sounds, melt taste touches, things that you are experiencing. That's what your

19:54.100 --> 19:59.780
sense of self depends on. So, if you then start reflecting and seeing, attending to properly,

19:59.780 --> 20:06.860
seeing the these things that you see here, taste touch are fundamentally out of your control.

20:06.860 --> 20:16.740
You might access this degree of the volition once a thing has arisen. But even that volition

20:16.740 --> 20:24.980
is within much greater image of non-control. Why? Because as I said, your heart can stop

20:24.980 --> 20:35.220
any second. And you can't even conceive having a say in that. And yet your whole life,

20:35.220 --> 20:38.100
all the things you experienced, all the things that you will experience, all the things

20:38.100 --> 20:44.500
you are experiencing right now, depends upon that beating muscle in your chest, that pumps

20:44.500 --> 20:49.780
blood. That's it. It's as random as this stream around us, that kind of runs over these

20:49.780 --> 20:56.820
rocks and moves the leaves and branches or whatever. It's as movement. But you can also

20:56.820 --> 21:02.860
see as a memory, you can't remember that putting your heart together, putting your body

21:02.860 --> 21:09.980
together, and then becoming that body over, you know, as you just had it. Yeah, it was

21:09.980 --> 21:13.900
just given to you. It's just given to you. It's just given to you. So you're not saying

21:13.900 --> 21:19.980
it's assembly, you're not saying it's operating and you certainly have no say in it's ending.

21:19.980 --> 21:24.980
Yet you regard it as yours. I mean, that is the discrepancy at the most fundamental

21:24.980 --> 21:31.340
existential level. You undo that discrepancy means you're attending things properly. That

21:31.340 --> 21:39.700
means your attention does not maintain that mistake. It does not maintain that discrepancy,

21:39.700 --> 21:45.220
which is a wrong attention. And that's attention of everybody. That pathogena attends, and

21:45.220 --> 21:54.100
every attention maintains that wrong order. Me first, my experience second. It means

21:54.100 --> 22:01.100
being such a relative. Exactly. Those are the result of that discrepancy that the pathogen

22:01.100 --> 22:09.420
is maintaining. So by seeing that you can't even own these things even if you want to,

22:09.420 --> 22:15.820
no matter how hard you want to, you recognize, oh, thinking that I own them, or rather entertaining

22:15.820 --> 22:25.060
the notions of ownership. Well, that's what suffering is. So then you recognize this is

22:25.060 --> 22:31.620
suffering. The arising of suffering is this very notion of ownership in regard to things

22:31.620 --> 22:38.900
that cannot be owned. And then consequently, the cessation of suffering is not the cessation

22:38.900 --> 22:45.300
of things that cannot be owned. You know, the Buddha did not have to kill himself in order

22:45.300 --> 22:49.500
to understand the nature of life. No, while you are alive, you understand the cessation

22:49.500 --> 22:56.060
of life. The cessation of life is cessation of appropriation of life. So he understands

22:56.060 --> 23:02.900
that cessation of suffering is removing of appropriation in regard to your life, your

23:02.900 --> 23:09.940
existence, you don't own it, removing the ownership, disowning it, not entertaining it.

23:09.940 --> 23:14.940
And then how you fulfill that, that's the phonoboture. Oh, this is the path that leads to

23:14.940 --> 23:20.940
this fulfillment, to this cessation of suffering. And then it's basically the everything that

23:20.940 --> 23:27.220
revolves around right view and right attention and right mindfulness. Which means that through

23:27.220 --> 23:33.220
right view, right attention and right mindfulness, constant practice, it will eventually saturate

23:33.220 --> 23:39.020
your whole life regardless of the circumstances, regardless of the feelings that have a reason,

23:39.020 --> 23:46.500
regardless of the pleasant unpleasant agreeable, disagreeable perception, regardless of everything,

23:46.500 --> 23:50.700
right view, right intention, right mindfulness, been brought to fulfillment, there will not

23:50.700 --> 24:02.660
be any kind of rekindling, so to speak, of the wrong order of that mistaken notion of ownership,

24:02.660 --> 24:08.180
of that habit, basically, of ownership of that discrepancy. And that's when noble

24:08.180 --> 24:13.180
belief of path has been practiced with fulfillment. So there are no traces of that discrepancy

24:13.180 --> 24:19.860
left of those wrong notions left in any regard, in regard in regard to any sense or any thought

24:19.860 --> 24:25.940
or any memory or any future plan. It's all saturated with the right attention, with

24:25.940 --> 24:30.340
the right mindfulness, with the right view. They then obviously, it's right effort, right

24:30.340 --> 24:39.740
reliability and so on. Right concentration. Right composure. Right composure, that's a

24:39.740 --> 24:49.980
better translation, yeah. He doesn't say about the taints to be abandoned by the straining.

24:49.980 --> 24:57.860
Here, bigger reflecting wisely abides with the eye of faculty restrained, while taints

24:57.860 --> 25:03.220
dexation fever might arise in one who abides with the eye of faculty under strain, there

25:03.220 --> 25:11.020
are no taints, a fexational fever in one who abides with the eye of faculty restrained.

25:11.020 --> 25:19.020
And so, likewise, with all the other senses. It's quite simple. Well, exactly, yeah, straight

25:19.020 --> 25:24.460
forward, yeah. Well, once the right view is established, that won't work. Well, none

25:24.460 --> 25:29.980
of that will work for somebody who doesn't have the right view as the suit opens up, yeah.

25:29.980 --> 25:35.940
It's the one for the one who sees, one who knows and one who sees. So once the right view

25:35.940 --> 25:41.500
has established, then the one with the right view reckons is, okay, now it's about guarding

25:41.500 --> 25:47.220
the senses, practicing the restraint. So none of the mistaken notions, the habits of

25:47.220 --> 25:53.300
mistaken notions and discrepancies that are spread or maintained through last a version

25:53.300 --> 26:00.020
of delusion, none of those will be arising to practicing the restraint. You stick to

26:00.020 --> 26:05.980
there long enough, and then they just, it becomes been possible for them to arise. It's

26:05.980 --> 26:11.940
like, like, basically having a habit and then kind of getting rid of the habit. You have

26:11.940 --> 26:17.580
to stick to the opposite behavior or to the restraint of the habit for a certain amount

26:17.580 --> 26:27.860
of time, depending on how strong those habits were. So once you stick to it and practice

26:27.860 --> 26:35.180
restraint and so on, and those habits stop arising, that's it. And then the noble disciple

26:35.180 --> 26:44.940
there's the right proper attention. It tends to be abandoned by using a bigger reflecting

26:44.940 --> 26:52.220
of what properly uses the robe only for protection from cold, from protection from heat, from contact

26:52.220 --> 26:58.700
with flies, mosquitoes, wind, and the sun, and creeping things, and only for the purpose

26:58.700 --> 27:06.300
of concealing the private parts. Reflecting properly, he uses alms food, neither for amusement,

27:06.300 --> 27:12.140
nor for intoxication, nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only

27:12.140 --> 27:18.660
for the endurance and continuance of this body, for ending this comfort and for assisting

27:18.660 --> 27:23.980
of the holy life. Considering thus, I shall terminate old feelings without erasing new

27:23.980 --> 27:31.620
feelings, and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort. What do you mean

27:31.620 --> 27:41.700
by not erasing new feelings? Well, like the feeling of hunger, eating too much.

27:41.700 --> 27:46.100
Yes, so you eat until the old feeling disappears, or hunger, but you don't overeat, so then

27:46.100 --> 27:54.180
you have a new feeling of discomfort of being overeat, overeat. So he uses the resting

27:54.180 --> 28:00.820
places, dwellings, only for protection from cold, from protection from heat, for protection

28:00.820 --> 28:06.300
from contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, and the sun, and creeping things, and only

28:06.300 --> 28:13.300
for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and for enjoying retreat. Reflecting

28:13.300 --> 28:20.500
properly, he uses the medicinal requisites, only for protection from erasing, afflicting

28:20.500 --> 28:27.060
feelings, and for the benefits of good health. While taints, vexation and fever might arise

28:27.060 --> 28:31.820
in one who does not use the requisite task, there are no taints, vexation of feeling

28:31.820 --> 28:39.020
like he uses them, thus these are called the taints that should be abandoned by using.

28:39.020 --> 28:46.220
Because in most of the time, in monasteries, that's what you try to do, you try to use

28:46.220 --> 28:56.820
those requisites as a monk, like that. That's before you have proper attention.

28:56.820 --> 29:06.220
I mean, it's something to aspire, sure, but obviously, if you want that to result in the

29:06.220 --> 29:12.540
abandoning of the taints, the right view is necessary, the right view comes first, it

29:12.540 --> 29:17.140
will be said that many times, it needs to come first. If you don't know what you're supposed

29:17.140 --> 29:24.220
to do, how can you do it? That's as simple as that. If you don't know what a dama is, how

29:24.220 --> 29:36.020
can you practice it? There's the taints to be abandoned by enduring. Here are a big collecting

29:36.020 --> 29:40.980
property, bears, cold and heat, hunger and thirst, and contact with flies, mosquitoes,

29:40.980 --> 29:48.460
wind and sun, creeping things. He endures, ill-spoken, unwelcome words, and arisen bodily

29:48.460 --> 29:56.360
feelings that are painful, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, distressing and menacing to life.

29:56.360 --> 30:01.220
While taints, a vexation of evil might arise in one who does not endure such things, there

30:01.220 --> 30:11.740
are no taints, vexation or feelings in one who endures them. So how does he endures the

30:11.740 --> 30:22.500
weather, uncomfortable feelings, painful experiences? By becoming, a lot of people can endure

30:22.500 --> 30:29.660
these things. Again, he will not, yeah, exactly, but he will not result in destruction of

30:29.660 --> 30:35.420
lust, aversion and delusion if there is no right view. With the right view and with the

30:35.420 --> 30:43.260
hardship, anything that was dependent, any of those habits, any of those discrepancies,

30:43.260 --> 30:50.620
they were kind of hiding about, dependent upon cherishing the notions of comfort, for

30:50.620 --> 30:56.740
example, will be destroyed with the right view that puts one through discomfort. So this

30:56.740 --> 31:03.300
comfort founded upon the right view will destroy any of the taints. It doesn't mean that

31:03.300 --> 31:12.540
the taints wouldn't be there, but in case they were, they would be destroyed. That's

31:12.540 --> 31:22.020
why the Buddha sometimes, like for some monks, with the right view, ascetic practice,

31:22.020 --> 31:30.260
do tangas, would be resulting in our hardship in developing further wisdom. For some other

31:30.260 --> 31:37.660
monks, with the right view, it wouldn't. So he said, let those who want to exert themselves

31:37.660 --> 31:43.020
in such practices, exert themselves at practices. But again, either way, the right view needs

31:43.020 --> 31:48.460
to be there. So because, you know, people, people's habits have evolved differently. People's

31:48.460 --> 31:55.100
lust have proliferated differently. Obviously, the existential discrepancies are the same,

31:55.100 --> 31:59.780
but the particular manifestations of it, yeah, there needs to be addressed. So it's basically

31:59.780 --> 32:06.700
like, you know, you might not necessarily target one by one, but you put yourself out

32:06.700 --> 32:11.940
through some discomfort in case things are there. It's basically like taking antibiotics

32:11.940 --> 32:20.980
to wipe the harmful bacteria. So you can aim at one or two, well, yeah, just you take

32:20.980 --> 32:30.780
a generic one, and you know, it will be covered to do it long enough. It will address it.

32:30.780 --> 32:36.820
So that's why that's what all the things means. Basically, if you go through all of those

32:36.820 --> 32:42.380
ways, there was absolutely nothing for anyone in the world with the right view that would

32:42.380 --> 32:48.220
be left. Because, you know, the things that you'll be destroying by seeing, but then, yeah,

32:48.220 --> 32:53.460
so somebody there might be all. He might be, might be enough. However, most likely, there

32:53.460 --> 32:58.420
will be some other things hiding elsewhere, and then basically by going through all of those

32:58.420 --> 33:04.340
through restraint, through enduring, through hardship, through seeing, they will remain

33:04.340 --> 33:11.100
nothing uncovered. Because again, like, like, like antibiotics, let's get back to them.

33:11.100 --> 33:16.420
Some are good for respiratory infections, but you know, some bacteria is resistant to it.

33:16.420 --> 33:21.420
So you might not necessarily have those bacteria, and okay, if you become an out of hand by

33:21.420 --> 33:29.220
taking only one or two, by practicing only one or two forms of the destruction of taints,

33:29.220 --> 33:33.420
that's fine. So if you become completely healthy by taking one or two antibiotics, that's

33:33.420 --> 33:37.860
fine. But if you know that you've taken one or two sufficiently enough, but you're still

33:37.860 --> 33:44.900
not fully healthy, okay, so there are issues elsewhere, then you try a different antibiotics.

33:44.900 --> 33:52.300
So basically, if somebody who gains the right view, reviews their mind, and okay, I go

33:52.300 --> 33:56.020
to the right view, but I'm not an out of hand. It means there are taints to be done, to

33:56.020 --> 34:01.140
be done with, to be, to be, to be dealt with. And that's, that's when you, when you start

34:01.140 --> 34:07.380
doing through restraint, got in the sense faculties. Okay, yes, sensuality might not be rising

34:07.380 --> 34:12.420
anymore, but I still don't feel that I've reached the unsupervised security for bondage.

34:12.420 --> 34:19.900
Okay, push yourself, take yourself out into discomfort, endure, avoid, and so on, and

34:19.900 --> 34:25.500
then, yes, eventually, you covered all the bases, and the arhanship will have to be the

34:25.500 --> 34:35.220
result. Yeah, that's what you said, avoiding the next one. Yeah, wisely avoid it. Yeah,

34:35.220 --> 34:41.860
he avoids wild elephants. Exactly. So he recognizes that he's not an arhaniyet. Does he

34:41.860 --> 34:47.620
need more time to apply himself? Thus, it will be very foolish to stand in front of the

34:47.620 --> 34:54.740
wild elephant, because it, quite likely, it will result in his death. Same with the wild

34:54.740 --> 35:03.180
dog, charcoal, no, no, no, sorry, cesspit, cesspit, cesspit, not, yeah, cliff, cliff,

35:03.180 --> 35:10.420
cliff, things they can kill you. Unsuitable seats, wandering, unsuitable places. Yeah, things

35:10.420 --> 35:15.020
they can compromise you, things they can kill you. Yeah, bad friends. Yeah, things they

35:15.020 --> 35:25.340
can distract you from the go. Avoid it. Thanks be to God by removing, which is gone. Here

35:25.340 --> 35:31.780
a bicker reflecting properly does not tolerate an arisen thought of central desire. He

35:31.780 --> 35:37.100
abandons it, he removes it, does away with it, annihilates it, or an a thought of ill will,

35:37.100 --> 35:43.420
a thought of cruelty. He does not tolerate arisen evil unwholesome states. He abandons

35:43.420 --> 35:51.980
it, removes it, does away with it, annihilates it, tends to be abandoned by developing. He

35:51.980 --> 35:57.260
reflects why it develops mindfulness and lightening factor, which is, he develops the

35:57.260 --> 36:04.940
seven factors of enlightenment. And each factor is supported by seclusion, dispassion, cessation,

36:04.940 --> 36:14.020
and ripens in the linkishment. What do you think that means? Seclusion, dispassion, and

36:14.020 --> 36:26.180
cessation. Each mindfulness factor is supported by seclusion. Yeah, seclusion for my wholesome

36:26.180 --> 36:30.460
states. Dispassion. Dispassion. Dispassion. Dispassion with results in dispassion, because

36:30.460 --> 36:35.460
you are not attracted to things anymore, cessation of suffering, cessation of lust, the version

36:35.460 --> 36:39.460
delusion, and the linkishment, freedom, and the freedom.

36:39.460 --> 36:45.460
Here ripens in the linkishment. Yeah. So those, that, because, is it, is it? Yeah.

36:45.460 --> 36:52.300
And a bicker who dwells restrained with the strength of all the taints, he has severed craving,

36:52.300 --> 36:57.780
flung off the fetters, and with the complete penetration of conceit, he has made an end

36:57.780 --> 37:03.780
of suffering. This was the best one said, the bickers were satisfied and delighted in the

37:03.780 --> 37:28.780
best ones words.
