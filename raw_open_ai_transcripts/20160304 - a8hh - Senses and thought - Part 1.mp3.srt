1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And again, I don't dare to tradition it, but in the West, it's the same.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's just in regard to different things, maybe more specific views as opposed to generic tradition.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But it's the same.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you get very upset, you point out, and the fact that you get upset on account of your downward view,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
if you don't see that as a big problem, as there's nothing else you can really discuss with that person.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, I can get upset, you know, you find me, you kick my doll, you do this, you do that.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But if you disagree with my downward views, if that bothers me,

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
it means, well, those are not the views of downward, it's that simple.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But yeah, it's remarkable, how far people would go.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Kind of knowing that, but ignoring it.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You know what I mean?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, people hold to views so strong, and in the West, definitely as much as any place.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And it means that how strong this objective, this type of attitude is.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But maybe in America, especially, because it's like a sensualism.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I think it's Western culture generally, because any of these individuals write the education,

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
mainly, the way you grow up, the way you're taught in schools and stuff,

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you just end up being, and no doubt, involuntarily, they're not aware of it themselves.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But you end up being channeled in the direction of that kind of objective sort of materialistic view,

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
whereby, you know, if you really commit to it, you come to a point where you think your thoughts don't exist.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's not the real thing. The real thing is only thing that is accessible to five senses,

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
things that you can see.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you were to stop and think about what the senses are, you'll get very confused.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So you wouldn't do it, you'll just keep going forward into the things, into the science, into the other things.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are there in the world, basically?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Which is all based on the assumption that the world is there, independent of you.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Which is the wrong assumption, because, you know, either the assumption, you need to exist first.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So it's a contradictory assumption.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And that was the main, like, a line of existentialism, such as existence precedes the essence.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's just the big, you know, whatever, whatever.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think it takes us, we need to come back to this first principle, that existence precedes the essence.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So you can't provide explanation, you can't develop an external view that will sort of then in return define your existence.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or something, why? Because you need to exist first, in order to do any of that.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Which means that's all secondary, which means you cannot stand for existence.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Obviously, they couldn't go further than that.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's a huge change that happened to me, you know, to be honest.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It just twisted everything around suddenly.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
These things make more sense to this world.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I thought it was so real.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And I'm just, you know, one little thing in this world that's real is,

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I know the world through my own, through experience.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, experience is more fundamental than the objects that I'm really just creating a model of a world that I might experience.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, it's determined.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Inasmuch, the objects of your senses define the domain of your sense.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In that sense, they are also determined by those senses now.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, you know, if your eyes are not working on limited or whatever,

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
they will limit the whole domain, the whole world of vision.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everything you've ever seen, everything you will see, everything you see.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Same with any other sense.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And it is just that little material organ.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sitting in the world, same as that cup, same as that bin, same as the stone, eyes.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But as Annabella said, causing that sort of thing.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, yeah, it's like that.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's just that they have this privileged position of, it's an object in the world,

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
because of which there are objects in the world, because of which you see objects in the world.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But it's an object in the world.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So, the practice is really to remove that privilege from your senses, from your sense-bases.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And which is why whenever they've described, they've described in that kind of external terms,

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
as a fresh eye in organs and so on, because that's what they are.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
They can't be more than that.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's the instrument in the world by which you are the perceiver and the conceiver of the world.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think this weird thing happening in this minute, I'm not used to meditating so much,

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
so I don't know if it probably doesn't mean anything, but that's a couple of days.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
When my eyes are open and unseen things, sometimes it feels like I'm not looking,

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not seeing objects, I'm seeing images of objects.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, that can be, I mean, a computer screen or something.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, well, for as long as, when you say you're seeing images of objects,

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
the objects that are now pushed in a background are not regarded as more real or more fundamental

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
than the images of them that you see.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because that's the problem that the assumption can kind of take up anything in that sense.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, these are just images. Well, if you say, well, your mind comes first,

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and people can get the hint of that, that the mind basically determines the experience as such,

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:04,000
internal or external, but because just that kind of little taste, little glimpse of that insight, so to speak,

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the assumption takes it up and then you kind of overshoot the mark and then you end up

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
everything is in my mind, like solipses or no idea, the world is just in me,

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but you don't exist just in my head, kind of thing.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But that you can see that being remotely rooted in something that resembles the truth,

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but actually they overshoot them and I was just a view that misrepresents.

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So if you see the images of objects, well, that's what's real for you at a time of seeing.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So then the background of the objects just becomes another possibility of those objects.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In other words, the objects now that are pushed to the side because you've seen the image,

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
become possibility away that those objects can appear again.

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because now you see them as images, and you see them as non-image, you see them as the real object,

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
they're just their modes of manifesting, and they're all equally real as such in their own domain.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So it's not that the real objects are more real than images,

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
because if you stop and you worry, even the real object is a metal image.

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Not entirely, it's founded upon the four great elements,

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
but if that image is not there, you wouldn't be able to even designate it as an object.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You just couldn't.

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And that is actually again, that can be a very good practice,

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
even the external things, the things that clearly define the things that you access through your senses,

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to start recognizing the mental presence in them,

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and not just default to an assumption that they are solid objects out there,

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the way you see them in the scene.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So it doesn't mean that there is a hidden reality behind them,

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
they're real, whichever way they appear,

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
but you can't even conceive the idea of appearance if it's not mental.

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Right.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If it doesn't take, at least to some extent, in a domain of mental and mentality.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There has to be some, yeah, all that other stuff.

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Today I had a strange thing,

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
or the meditation has been very mild, I think,

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
because tired or something.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Today my mind is wandering a bit, and I would have like an image just popped in my head,

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in this case, it was like a bullet ice cream.

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And all it wants, all together, the image, the intense image,

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and then sort of the awareness that I was aware of it,

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and then this flame of desire, you know, craving,

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and then pleasure, strong pleasure.

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And it just sort of push all at once,

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and three, four, five seconds later, it just disappeared.

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You know, and I went on to something else,

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
but that was very interesting,

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and I started to play with that a little bit,

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
because it was not an overwhelming kind of loss.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But there was one reason it was interesting,

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
is because I could really feel the feeling,

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the pleasure of feeling, and a lot of things.

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, there was the pure kind of example of delight,

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
sensual delight, which is entirely mental.

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Your senses, they recognize agreeable and disagreeable,

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the five senses, and with a said, they're like five animals,

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
they have their domains, they want to feed in grounds,

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
how they call them, and they want to go after

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
what they like to eat, so to speak.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So the eyes go out the pleasant sights,

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but that's only to a certain extent,

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the actual notion of sensuality,

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and the delight in central pleasures.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's what keeps you bound to them.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's not that the existence of the five senses is the problem.

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So, and that's when you start to recognize,

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
by seeing that delight, how actually,

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
it's the mental take on pleasure,

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the associated with the senses,

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that keeps you kind of enslaved to them,

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
not the actual plane.

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So, Arahand Kuddi, the nice, his favorite one,

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
but he will not induce their mental delight anymore.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That doesn't mean that he won't feel any pleasure

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
of that pleasant agreeable taste,

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
but for the arising, for the ceasing,

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and for the persisting of that pleasure,

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
at any time, he won't feel any delight,

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
associated with it.

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And that's another thing that comes down to what I said,

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
when you have to start recognizing the mental image,

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the presentation, the dharma, basically.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In your thoughts, n, in things that you access through your senses,

151
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
because they are determined as such,

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
because of the mind.

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So, if you recognize the image in any ice cream,

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and then the real ice cream,

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
they're having common that they both appeared mentally.

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
In a way, as a presentation of an ice cream,

157
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
as an image of an ice cream,

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
as a phenomenon of an ice cream,

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and that's where the practice needs to pertain.

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So, it can't pertain just to you,

161
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
originally, like dismissing your thoughts,

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
or just thinking, or thinking this in response to that,

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
or whatever.

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Nor can it pertain only to that which concerns the senses.

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No, just say no to everything.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Just do not engage in any agreeable sense experience

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
it's not necessarily central, because it will miss the point.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But if you fear mind on the level of that mental presentation,

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
that dharma, that phenomenon,

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that's in common to both,

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
then you'll be free from both whichever it is,

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
whether you think about an ice cream,

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
or you're actually eating the ice cream,

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
it will not induce delight,

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
which is that which keeps you bound,

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
which is why its centrality is unwholesome.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, because usually people are saying,

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
ah, thinking is the problem,

179
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
because when I think about it,

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll get all bound up,

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
so I'll stop thinking about it.

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But then, yeah, you might do that one,

183
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but you won't be always able to stop thinking about it,

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and then when you do come,

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
because ice cream, you just,

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
well, they won't be much restraint.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Even if you're restraint,

188
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
even if you're just moderate,

189
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and you just eat one spoon a day,

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
still, you eat that one spoon a day with delight.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Even if you eat no spoon at all,

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
you will have delight in the experience.

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Which is why a satisism,

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
per se, is wrong,

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
when people just,

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
the simile of the deer,

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the herd,

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and imagine what I think in the beginning fourth,

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
fifth shooter,

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
when it says,

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the first group of deer,

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
eats the bait,

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the maralais,

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and where they just eat it.

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They don't think well.

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Because that maralais does whatever he wants.

207
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The second group of deer,

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
they see the first group,

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and then they blame the bait,

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
so then they completely shun the bait,

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and they run into the mountains,

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
when there's no bait around to provoke them.

213
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But after a while,

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
their energy, you know, goes down,

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
not enough food,

216
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
then they come back,

217
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and they eat the bait,

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
unwarily.

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And then the third group sees the third group,

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and says, well, what if we stay among the bait,

221
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
but eat carefully?

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And then,

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
they do that,

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and then the mara,

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
the hunter comes,

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and he sees the bait eaten,

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
but nothing is caught on the bait.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So he can't see those deer anymore.

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They come and eat his bait,

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
but he can't catch them.

231
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So then,

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
then it says in the suit,

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
so then the mara decides to leave them alone,

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
not try to harass him further,

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
in case he harasses them further.

236
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
They'll start telling everybody else

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
how to avoid his bait.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then,

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
it's a comparison to,

240
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
kind of, obviously,

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
essentially, Dalgons,

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and then the formal set,

243
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
which is, kind of,

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
a default mode for many monks,

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and many people,

246
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
all this volume,

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you know, just kind of determination,

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and just say no to everything.

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And you can spend your whole life doing it.

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And, you know, you might not be, kind of,

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
wearing a, going around naked,

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
like, does a set,

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
or wearing a good bag,

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
or sleeping in thorns,

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and torturing yourself.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But the fact that your mental attitude,

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
denies the bait,

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
blames the bait,

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
means,

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you're not escaping it.

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, you're still hooked on it.

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And it's impossible, really,

264
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
for anyone in our heart,

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
as well, to,

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you can't,

267
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
not have experience,

268
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
pain and pleasure.

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's true.

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And so that's what I mean.

271
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's the,

272
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
the wisdom of Finara

273
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
is found in a completely different direction,

274
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
or in the middle direction,

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
which is basically,

276
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
saying yes to the bait,

277
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
saying no to the bait.

278
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What does it have in common?

279
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Any of these reactions.

280
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It has in common,

281
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the phenomenon of the bait.

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
If I free my mind

283
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
in regard to the phenomenon of the bait,

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
if I see it as in permanent,

285
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
as disagreeable,

286
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and as something that cannot be appropriated,

287
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and practice the long enough,

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
whether you're among the bait,

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
or without the bait,

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
you'll be fine.

291
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Because there was never a problem.

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Right.

293
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Who would say,

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
that's what delight is.

295
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hmm.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Thinking that it's.

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, delight, you can do.

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's actually,

299
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
it's delight.

300
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Delighting in the idea

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
of engaging in something

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
with your senses,

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
whether it's this pleasant taste,

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
pleasant sight, pleasant delight,

305
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and allowing your mind

306
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
to be overtaken by that,

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
means you're delighting.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If falling into it,

309
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
means you're.

310
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, it means you're,

311
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
you're, you're hooked onto the bait.

312
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So, but if you remove the delight,

313
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the bait can stay.

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It can be right in front of your face,

315
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
if you're not pressured into biting it.

316
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And you, you remove that by understanding objects.

317
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, no, by understanding both.

318
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's your sense.

319
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
By understanding the phenomena

320
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that's in common,

321
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
to the objects,

322
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
whether externally,

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
internally or internally,

324
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
externally.

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Understanding what appears.

326
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Phenomenological, yes.

327
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Not explaining it

328
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
in terms of, oh,

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
this is only permanent,

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
this ice cream, you know,

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
it's going to melt,

332
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
it's going to disappear in the sun,

333
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
it's never real.

334
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No.

335
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
An image of an ice cream,

336
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
an image of pleasant taste,

337
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
an image of a pleasant sight,

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
pleasant touch,

339
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that enchants.

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That has in common,

341
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in your mind,

342
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
with the actual image,

343
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
even if you're not actually looking at somebody

344
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
or something,

345
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
eating something,

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
those things are,

347
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
so you don't need exposure

348
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
to centrality in order to define centrality,

349
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
because it's defined by your mind.

350
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So, you actually need to draw from it

351
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
in order to see that,

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
like the main,

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
the main reason for being centrally bound

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
is your mind,

355
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
your mental assumption,

356
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
in regard to it.

357
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Then you approve that,

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and then it's fine,

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
even if you have things right

360
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
up front to you.

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So,

362
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
it comes down to,

363
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
being able to either think,

364
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
or directly experience

365
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
through the senses,

366
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
a pleasant thing,

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and not be taken by it,

368
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
being able to think,

369
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
or directly experience the senses,

370
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
unpleasant thing,

371
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and not feel aversion towards it,

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
in terms of this kind of pressing

373
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
need to get rid of it.

374
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
How would I look to you?

375
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Extends down to what we spoke before,

376
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
about the neutrophilic,

377
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
which is where people,

378
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
well, people don't see it.

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So, usually that's what's associated

380
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
with boredom or the indolence.

381
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So, you need excitement,

382
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
or you need,

383
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
well, you need anything, really.

384
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So, when you don't feel anything,

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
you don't want to be resting

386
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
on that feeling either.

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And that's the important bit.

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's a subtle one.

389
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah, it's a form of delight.

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I earned this rest.

391
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You did.

392
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You might have earned physical rest,

393
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
but you've never earned,

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
unless you're another

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
mental rest.

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And by mental rest, I mean,

397
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
giving in.

398
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Like, when they both together,

399
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
similarly, of cow,

400
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
with open wounds,

401
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
if it lays on the ground,

402
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
it's eaten by the insects on the ground.

403
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
If it lays on the tree,

404
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
or a wall,

405
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
it's eaten by the insects,

406
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
they live there.

407
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So, whatever,

408
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
whatever it chooses to,

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
whew, rest just for a second,

410
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
it's being eaten by that.

411
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's the attitude you need to develop.

412
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Mentally.

413
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Obviously, people, again,

414
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
they overshoot

415
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the assumption of the mind.

416
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And so, you end up thinking,

417
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
it's just this constant tension

418
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that you have to live through.

419
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But it's not.

420
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You can set your body to sleep.

421
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Feed it.

422
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Take it for a walk.

423
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Send it for a swing, whatever.

424
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Mentally, don't rest upon any of those actions.

425
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And don't rest,

426
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
means, don't lose mindfulness

427
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
in regard to it, basically.

428
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Don't let your mind overtake it.

429
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And you forget about yourself.

430
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And then you really

431
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
are taken by what you're doing.

432
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Even if it's not unwholesome.

433
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's unwholesome for that reason.

434
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So, that's how you approved the delight.

435
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Because if you can notice,

436
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
if your mind remains unwavered

437
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
in regard to that subtle,

438
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
neutral feeling,

439
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
doesn't eat anything,

440
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
doesn't require anything,

441
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
doesn't run away from anything.

442
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The pressure arises,

443
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
you'll be able to leave it alone.

444
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Because the pleasure of the senses,

445
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the delight is mental,

446
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
in regard to the central pleasure.

447
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But one thing you can recognize

448
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
is that, no matter how great

449
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that central pleasure might be,

450
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
it can never ever be anything more

451
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
than was defined by your sense organs.

452
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It can be the greatest taste.

453
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's still a taste.

454
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's still dependent on the tongue.

455
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And it can never be more than that.

456
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It can be the most beautiful sight in the world, again.

457
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
When you forget that it's fully determined

458
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
by the pair of flesh-y eyes,

459
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
you can have the whole image

460
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
in the drum and the apprehension,

461
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the expectation and the realization

462
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
of this great spectacle.

463
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Because you lost sight of yourself

464
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
completely taken by it.

465
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But if you know,

466
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
whatever you see,

467
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
whatever you hear,

468
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
whatever you taste, touch,

469
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
smell,

470
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
it can never be more than that.

471
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So, in scene,

472
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
let it just be seen,

473
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you heard,

474
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
let it just be heard.

475
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And so, that's basically what it is.

476
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It comes down when you recognize that,

477
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
again,

478
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the entire spectrum

479
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
of sense objects,

480
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
no matter how great it is,

481
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
let's write up down any direction,

482
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it's fully determined.

483
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It cannot kind of step outside

484
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
even a millimeter

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
out of the sensor of the domain,

486
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
which is a six-cent base,

487
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
which is something that the translation

488
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
like the fields,

489
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
the senses are like the fields for these things,

490
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
it cannot be more than that ever.

491
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Why?

492
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Why then?

493
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
If I...

494
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But not knowing it cannot be more than that,

495
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
you delight at the prospect

496
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
of being more.

497
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And that's mental.

498
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because they delight,

499
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
can pull you,

500
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
push you,

501
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
make you pursue the senses,

502
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
but in the end,

503
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
all you're going to get is sense

504
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and it's object.

505
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And I agree with it,

506
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
which is why usually people

507
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
are giving into the desires like,

508
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
oh, was that all?

509
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The expectations are always high,

510
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
because that's how the mind,

511
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
that's how the delight works.

512
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And it's nothing unusual about it,

513
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
it's actually quite normal.

514
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But obviously not knowing that,

515
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
you associate that delight,

516
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
that is mentioned

517
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
with this prospect

518
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
of that sensual desire

519
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and fulfillment,

520
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
feeling to see that

521
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that delight takes you

522
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
in the domain of that sense

523
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
that has its own scope.

524
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So eyes cannot experience

525
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
more anything more than sights.

526
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
ears cannot get you anything more

527
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
than pleasure of a sound.

528
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So whether the greatest

529
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
most refined is still a sound.

530
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The thing with pleasure

531
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
is the feeling of perception.

532
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
If you think of eyescream,

533
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
there's a pleasant feeling.

534
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Every time you think of eyescream,

535
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
there's a pleasant feeling

536
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
every single time.

537
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
There seems to suggest

538
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
in a mind that there is

539
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
something there.

540
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Well, the pleasure is real.

541
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But why is it always connected

542
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
with a particular perception

543
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
or image?

544
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, it can be random.

545
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It can be circumstantial,

546
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
because you try to eyescream

547
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and you really like it.

548
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Because there is such a thing

549
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
as a pleasant taste by default.

550
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But the problem is,

551
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
your question,

552
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
why is this connected?

553
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Assumes that the connection

554
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
between the two somewhere,

555
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
somewhere inside,

556
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
of the sense objects.

557
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So if you kind of unravel it all,

558
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
then you will be able to kind of

559
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
cut those wires,

560
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and it will not be,

561
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
that's not enough.

562
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The problem,

563
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the question you asked

564
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
is a symptom

565
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
that you were already affected

566
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
by the perception of eyescream.

567
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's your response

568
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
to the fact that you don't want

569
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
this cave

570
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
from the eyescream.

571
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You don't know the gratification

572
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
in that regard.

573
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You don't recognize the danger,

574
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and you don't see the escape from it.

575
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Hence, why?

576
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Hence, yes.

577
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Hence, no.

578
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Hence, maybe.

579
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Hence, yes and no.

580
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Any of those acts

581
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
are just response,

582
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
your ways of responding to the fact

583
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
that you are already touched by that,

584
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
but that phenomenon.

585
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You are taking back.

586
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Because whatever,

587
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
whatever is perceived,

588
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
there is a feeling.

589
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
There is always a feeling.

590
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Feeling perception.

591
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes.

592
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So,

593
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you are trying to do it.

594
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You are trying to separate them,

595
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
so you are not affected by any more.

596
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The thing is,

597
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
you have to go the other way.

598
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And by the other way,

599
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I mean,

600
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
by seeing the perception

601
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and feeling are inseparable.

602
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And the dear eyes on their own

603
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
means,

604
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
well, you can wander

605
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
for the rest of your life.

606
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Why is the thought

607
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
of ice cream always pleasant?

608
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh,

609
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
you can just accept that.

610
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And instead of questioning that,

611
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
try to find a place

612
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
whereby you don't care.

613
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And by that,

614
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I mean,

615
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
you don't care

616
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
not in a sense you can order it,

617
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
but in a sense,

618
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
perception of pleasant ice cream

619
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
doesn't bother me anymore.

620
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It doesn't touch me anymore,

621
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
it doesn't command me anymore.

622
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It doesn't make me do things anymore,

623
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
it doesn't make me think things anymore.

624
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Cannot overtake me.

625
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And then,

626
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
you might wonder,

627
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
why is it pleasant

628
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
or you might not wonder that?

629
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But there will be relevant.

630
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Because the only reason you wonder

631
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
is that now,

632
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is because you do realize,

633
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
you do recognize the problem

634
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
of being pulled by your senses.

635
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So, your question,

636
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
is kind of trying to solve it.

637
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But if you actually solve it,

638
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
the proper way,

639
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
questions become,

640
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
but it doesn't.

641
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Because it's not,

642
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
why is it always pleasant?

643
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You should really ask yourself,

644
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
why,

645
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
why am I being touched by that?

646
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
By that image.

647
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
By that pleasure.

648
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Why am I being,

649
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
why is it controlling me?

650
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Why is it better

651
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
if I'm,

652
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
well, if I get already,

653
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
so to speak,

654
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
why is it better

655
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
if, if I find a way,

656
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
where that pleasure

657
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
cannot access me?

658
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You think about that,

659
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and you will start to recognize the danger.

660
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You will start to recognize the gratification,

661
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and gratification is what I was speaking about.

662
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Not knowing gratification means

663
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
confusing your delight,

664
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
with the actual,

665
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
like, central consumption.

666
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And you recognize that,

667
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
not matter how great the light is,

668
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
gratification remains confined

669
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
to the domain of a particular sense.

670
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's inconceivable for it to be anything more,

671
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
despite what your delight makes you expect.

672
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The pleasure of a sight

673
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
cannot be experienced

674
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
by anything other than your eyes.

675
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So you recognize,

676
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
ah, that's the extent of gratification.

677
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
There is no more.

678
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Then you recognize the danger as well.

679
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Expecting more.

680
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Well,

681
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
through that expectation of more,

682
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
you blindly jump back

683
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
into those domains

684
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
that are not yours.

685
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You're going between the eye and sight.

686
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You're going between the nose

687
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and smells, ears,

688
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and sounds.

689
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And basically, it's just like running

690
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
in the middle of a motorway,

691
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
which is not yours,

692
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
but you don't know it.

693
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So you just run right in the middle,

694
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and then something will hit you sooner or later,

695
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
which is what it will compare,

696
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
giving you the sincerity,

697
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
like, putting your head on a chocolate block,

698
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
where the X falls,

699
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and it will fall.

700
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's not yours.

701
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Neither that perception

702
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
nor that feeling.

703
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So if you're wondering why,

704
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
how did that come about?

705
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It means you already took it as mind,

706
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
which that's where it must take it.

707
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Not finding out the answer

708
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
to those particular questions.

709
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So you can't help.

710
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You can't just stop

711
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and will the opposite.

712
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I will not engage in sensuality anymore.

713
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Well, I guess you could do that

714
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
if you develop genres,

715
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and then through them,

716
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
you could think that,

717
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and then you could stand

718
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
for that determination.

719
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But otherwise,

720
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
you have to recognize

721
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
gratification,

722
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the danger.

723
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Why is it dangerous

724
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
if I give in?

725
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And that will offer

726
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
the sight of escape.

727
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Ah,

728
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
if I remove the delight,

729
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
in this,

730
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
nothing to gather the whole world,

731
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
just in this particular sense,

732
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
in these five senses.

733
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So you're not chasing after every object,

734
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
you remove the delight in the eye,

735
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
because of which,

736
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
you delight in the sight.

737
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But if you recognize

738
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
it's fully confined to your eyes,

739
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
fully confined to your ears,

740
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
you remove the delight in regard to that,

741
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and you're like,

742
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
oh, okay, I'm free from this,

743
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
because no matter how much it arises,

744
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
it can never sort of,

745
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
well, go behind me

746
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and kind of scoop me out again

747
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
as he used to do.

748
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Which is why there,

749
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
there's a similar in the suitters,

750
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
when the Buddha compares,

751
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
well, somebody is free from sensuality,

752
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
it leaves like, like,

753
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
a drop of water on the blade,

754
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
on a sharp blade,

755
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
but it's not cut bad.

756
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Because the five senses, basically,

757
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
entirely, which means

758
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
your whole world really,

759
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
is not actually yours,

760
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
it belongs to the mind.

761
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The eyes in your head,

762
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
ears, nose, tongue,

763
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
body, everything.

764
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Anyway, it's easy,

765
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
it's not just mouth,

766
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
stasis, and so on.

767
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's not yours.

768
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Never would.

769
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm realizing again that,

770
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
it marries the detour,

771
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
well,

772
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
those things are,

773
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
as I've been around,

774
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
undetermined,

775
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
those, those bases.

776
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What do you mean?

777
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Well, when he,

778
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
you don't have to take service here.

779
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
No, his mind becomes undetermined.

780
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Or each is the undetermined.

781
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The undetermined.

782
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Those things are just senses.

783
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Well, the determinations have ceased,

784
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
they don't become the undetermined.

785
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
They just cease to act as determinations.

786
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The determinations of his self.

787
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
To just another way of saying,

788
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
he stops taking it as his.

789
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And they have ceased.

790
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
He let, he leaves them be.

791
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
They have ceased.

792
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Seists to exist as me and mine

793
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and determining me and mine.

794
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So that's what the undetermined is.

795
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Because if there wouldn't be undetermined,

796
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
freedom from the determined

797
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
would not be possible.

798
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But because there is the undetermined,

799
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
freedom from the determined is possible.

800
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So the island doesn't create anyone.

801
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
He just kind of finds a way

802
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
to step into it.

803
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Because it's already there.

804
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The undetermined.

805
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And you step to it

806
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
through developing full knowledge of it.

807
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
There is absolutely not a way.

808
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Another question was related to this.

809
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
For the wrong question.

810
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That everything seems to,

811
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
obviously things seem to correspond to each other.

812
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Like a sight, a sound,

813
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
you know, a sight of a river,

814
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
a sound of a river,

815
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
a touch of a river,

816
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
all that.

817
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You know, a correspondence.

818
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah.

819
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I can feed it.

820
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I mean, I can touch it.

821
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You can experience it through different senses.

822
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah.

823
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So they correspond.

824
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So it's very easy to assume that it's,

825
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
there's that one thing out there.

826
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The river.

827
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That's what the river said.

828
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Either things usually appears

829
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
itself when it's seen twice,

830
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
either in reflection,

831
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
or experience simultaneously

832
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
through two different senses or more.

833
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah.

834
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Then they conclude,

835
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
like, it's effortless.

836
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That's what ignorance means going with the grain.

837
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That's the grain.

838
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Or the direction of the stream.

839
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So you go against it.

840
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
If you were to practice correctly,

841
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
you're against holding it apart.

842
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Well, you go against it by,

843
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
by full understanding, really.

844
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
There's a method or something.

845
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
By full understanding,

846
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
they each domain,

847
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
each sense,

848
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
if that's what your approach is.

849
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It would be, well, it wouldn't be,

850
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
inducing the sense of self anymore.

851
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And you said, actually,

852
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
the self disappears.

853
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
When a thing is seen twice in reflection,

854
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
or experience through two different senses simultaneously,

855
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
it's the self of that thing,

856
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the self identity of the same thing

857
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
that you hear and that you see.

858
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, it's the same thing.

859
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That same is,

860
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
be neither in what you see,

861
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
nor do what you hear,

862
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I, it's in me.

863
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh, it's the same self thing.

864
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Myself is experiencing the same as of these things.

865
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Myself is.

866
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Myself is independent of any other thing

867
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
that I experience through my sense.

868
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's how it kind of goes.

869
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm using these senses to access these things.

870
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah, their mind.

871
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So you, you, you will have to be able,

872
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
which is what I, what I mean,

873
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
when I talk about the,

874
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
the simultane,

875
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
or the principle of simultaneity

876
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and the notes of meditation.

877
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
When you simultaneously hear,

878
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
see something.

879
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
If your mindfulness is established properly,

880
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
you'll be aware of it as too independent,

881
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
but simultaneity is the mains.

882
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So they don't actually meet any of the senses ever on their own.

883
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
They will kind of come together in your mind,

884
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
but in their own domains,

885
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
like, well, as I said,

886
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
in other words,

887
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
they've got to find it indifferent to each other.

888
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's just not even a,

889
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
like, there is not even awareness

890
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
in your hearing,

891
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
in your hearing of your sight.

892
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's inconceivable.

893
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Because having awareness of your sight,

894
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
in your hearing,

895
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
would be, well,

896
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
your sight appears in your hearing,

897
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
even as a possibility,

898
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
even as some,

899
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
as a different,

900
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and that seems inconceivable,

901
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
which doesn't exist.

902
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Which is why you have five consciousnesses

903
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
in regard to five senses,

904
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and then six ones.

905
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So you have six types of consciousness.

906
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You know, when I...

907
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Always.

908
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
When if I see something here,

909
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
something,

910
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and also touch and experience...

911
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Imagine six layers

912
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
of your experience.

913
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
But...

914
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Symbol tenures.

915
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
This stuff seems like there is

916
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
a pain-different attention

917
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
from this center here.

918
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
From one.

919
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You give...

920
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You still have the assumption

921
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
of me and myself as the core.

922
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Or your experience.

923
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
When you have to keep developing mindfulness

924
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
as long as it's necessary,

925
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and then, well, as I said before,

926
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
when you feel that core,

927
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
you can't start straight

928
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
onto the senses now.

929
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The contemplation I'm talking about.

930
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They can come later.

931
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It gives us to suffer.

932
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So now you would have to take up the experience

933
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
as a whole,

934
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and include in that sense of core,

935
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
that sense of center,

936
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
which is sense of me and I are,

937
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
as a phenomenon,

938
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
as a peripheral phenomenon,

939
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
without making it actual.

940
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
All that we spoke before.

941
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Because by including it,

942
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
bit by bit,

943
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
you become aware of it.

944
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So then,

945
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
the time will come when you recognize,

946
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
well, if I'm aware of it,

947
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
means it appears as a phenomenon,

948
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
which means it will cease as a phenomenon,

949
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
which means it can possibly be me,

950
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
or anything related to me,

951
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
in any way.

952
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's just a thought.

953
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Well, just everything is just a thought.

954
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's not a sight.

955
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's an image.

956
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, yeah, the sense of stuff.

957
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

958
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's independent of the senses,

959
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
which is how it has that

960
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
assumed privileged position over then.

961
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But if you stop and think as we spoke before,

962
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
this body here,

963
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
this physical body right here,

964
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
which basically covers up the basis

965
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
of the senses,

966
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the five senses,

967
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and then the experienced general experience

968
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
as at all,

969
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
in my sense of self,

970
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
or whatever else,

971
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
would that be conceivable

972
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
in any shape or form

973
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
if this physical body

974
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
is to be destroyed

975
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
next instance?

976
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
He wouldn't.

977
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So then,

978
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
the privileged position

979
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and attitude is slowly being undermined.

980
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But you have to keep doing it.

981
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And then you can,

982
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you're not even denying

983
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
the sense of privilege of you.

984
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
No, you include it.

985
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So you make sure it gets undermined

986
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
with the right,

987
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
with the right setup,

988
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
with the right insight,

989
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
with the right reflection.

990
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Which is why,

991
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
in the Anapala Saksata,

992
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I will breathe in like this.

993
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I will breathe,

994
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
so you're,

995
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
keep including yourself.

996
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You keep including yourself

997
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
in the next breath,

998
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
in this breath.

999
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Now, do it like this.

1000
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So you include in your very

1001
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
volition,

1002
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and intention,

1003
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
while you're seeing it clearly,

1004
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it even the most,

1005
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the strongest willed thing,

1006
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
the most determined thing,

1007
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
well, could have never been yours

1008
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
to begin with it.

1009
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Absolutely.

1010
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
There simply no room

1011
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
for itself.

1012
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And not just there's no room,

1013
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
it's unnecessary at all.

1014
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Which is why there is no room for it.

1015
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Because that's a,

1016
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
you see the breath is intentional.

1017
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Hmm.

1018
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So you,

1019
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
you've paid attention to the breath.

1020
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You find that it's really

1021
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
intending.

1022
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Well, you can find it,

1023
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
but as long as you include

1024
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
your sense of self,

1025
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
in regard to it,

1026
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
what happens is people

1027
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
would kind of forget about

1028
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
itself,

1029
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and then it will be our breathing

1030
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that happens.

1031
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Oh, it's this thing breathing me

1032
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
or it's this body really.

1033
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
All that is,

1034
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
you can say that,

1035
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
it's not inaccurate,

1036
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
but the fact that you left

1037
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
a sense of self out of it,

1038
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
means you're not really

1039
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
addressing the problem.

1040
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's like getting the

1041
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
decent medicine,

1042
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
but applying it over a

1043
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
cover-up wound.

1044
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So it doesn't actually reach

1045
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
the point where it's

1046
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
supposed to be active.

1047
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So you keep including

1048
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
your sense of self.

1049
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You keep bringing it forward.

1050
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You're not letting it

1051
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
kind of wiggle out,

1052
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
which is the same,

1053
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
the combination of

1054
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
discraft to you,

1055
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
when you recognize,

1056
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
okay, this body is right

1057
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
here, right now,

1058
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
in this situation,

1059
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
in this position,

1060
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
in this shape of form,

1061
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
fully material,

1062
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
entirely,

1063
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
composed of elements.

1064
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
There's absolutely nothing

1065
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
in this body

1066
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
that doesn't pertain

1067
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
to one of the four

1068
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
great elements.

1069
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So it's a hundred percent

1070
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
object,

1071
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
because of which

1072
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
your thinking of what objects are,

1073
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and that right reflection

1074
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
while you're thinking,

1075
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
stands there,

1076
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
because of that

1077
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
random object,

1078
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
like that kettle,

1079
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
like that bottle,

1080
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
like that cup.

1081
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So if something happens to it,

1082
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
on that material level,

1083
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
in which you have no axis,

1084
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
at all,

1085
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
you realize nothing can

1086
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
remain standing,

1087
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
even the greatest sense of

1088
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
self.

1089
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So establish your mind

1090
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
upon that,

1091
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
and by establishing your mind

1092
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
upon that,

1093
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I mean, in the beginning,

1094
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
you have to keep bringing it up,

1095
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
then you fall from

1096
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
that,

1097
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
but then you bring it up,

1098
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and that thought,

1099
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
that perception,

1100
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
of that relationship,

1101
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
stays.

1102
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Means, ah,

1103
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the mind is established

1104
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
to the degree.

1105
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Keep it.

1106
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
When you lose it,

1107
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:23,000
you have to keep it.

1108
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Good one, say that,

1109
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you recognize in that,

1110
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
in this sense of self,

1111
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
this sort of derivative,

1112
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
like the different senses,

1113
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
sort of different senses

1114
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
pointing to that one focal point,

1115
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and then recognizing that,

1116
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
this, the,

1117
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
impermanence of,

1118
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
of the sense,

1119
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
is a way to get to realize

1120
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
that, that sense of self,

1121
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
which is derived from,

1122
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
is, um,

1123
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
not solid,

1124
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
not solid.

1125
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It can be,

1126
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
for as long as you,

1127
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
uh, first acknowledge,

1128
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
that focal point,

1129
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
because it's real,

1130
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
as such,

1131
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and it's there.

1132
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Because usually people

1133
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
would result,

1134
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
the contemplation of impermanence

1135
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
of,

1136
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
a kind,

1137
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
to obscure,

1138
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
or to deny,

1139
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
or to cover up,

1140
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
or to remove,

1141
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
that focal point.

1142
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Uh, but that's,

1143
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
that's the result.

1144
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
If it's there,

1145
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
then,

1146
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
it has a reason.

1147
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Whatever has a reason,

1148
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
means you want to rise.

1149
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
This is no interference

1150
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
with that.

1151
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So,

1152
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
if you were to comprehend

1153
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
impermanence like that,

1154
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
yeah,

1155
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
it will point out that

1156
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
this focal point

1157
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
is not,

1158
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
well,

1159
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
it cannot be taken as me,

1160
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
in mind,

1161
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
because it's fully dependent,

1162
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
upon these external,

1163
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
organs,

1164
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
they have no control over.

1165
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But that can become very,

1166
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
only after,

1167
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
that focal point has been acknowledged,

1168
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
as phenomena,

1169
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
because people often get,

1170
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
too quick,

1171
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
to say,

1172
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
there's no self.

1173
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
There is no self,

1174
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
no self,

1175
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
no self.

1176
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
There is self.

1177
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
There is focal point.

1178
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's not yours.

1179
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That's what no self is.

1180
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's like throwing out the self,

1181
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
throwing out the whole problem,

1182
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and,

1183
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
yeah,

1184
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
like a scientist,

1185
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
just,

1186
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
just your objective,

1187
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
exactly,

1188
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
you're ignoring the problem.

1189
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah.

1190
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So, that's what meant

1191
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
before,

1192
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
it's not possible,

1193
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
meditation here today.

1194
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Whatever,

1195
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
you include that.

1196
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's the same principle.

1197
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Whatever,

1198
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
it has a reason.

1199
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Like,

1200
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
trying to exclude it,

1201
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
is a mistake,

1202
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
just for that very reason.

1203
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Because you have no say

1204
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
over things arising,

1205
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
because if you would,

1206
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
well,

1207
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
there would be a sense of self there.

1208
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But they manifest,

1209
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
when they manifest.

1210
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And if you stop,

1211
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
trying to interfere with it,

1212
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
if you recognize that,

1213
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
whatever has a reason,

1214
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
you will see that,

1215
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
for those already reasons,

1216
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
of simple rising,

1217
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
that's why,

1218
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
if you have to cease,

1219
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
not for anything else.

1220
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And that's what impermanence is.

1221
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So, impermanence,

1222
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
actually,

1223
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
is in the rising of things,

1224
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
not like looking,

1225
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
waiting for the destruction

1226
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
to prove that they're impermanent.

1227
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Now, they're impermanent

1228
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
because you're experiencing that.

1229
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And to recognize that,

1230
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
whatever is arising,

1231
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
it's complex,

1232
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
it's like an integrated system,

1233
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and everything integrated

1234
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
has to descend to it.

1235
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Well,

1236
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
it's not even that,

1237
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
like that's,

1238
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
that's another designation

1239
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
that you will put on top.

1240
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
System integrated or simple,

1241
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
or whatever.

1242
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The most accurate you can get

1243
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
is saying,

1244
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
it has a reason.

1245
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It is.

1246
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
That's it.

1247
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And that's the most accurate phenomenon.

1248
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And you don't have to go for,

1249
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
well, you can't actually go further than that.

1250
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Because any other,

1251
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
more elaborate explanation,

1252
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
would be sort of going back down,

1253
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
and then provide an explanation for it.

1254
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And an explanation,

1255
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
even if it's the other pleasing one,

1256
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
is still an explanation.

1257
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So it has to,

1258
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
it has to be recognized on that general level,

1259
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
where it just arises.

1260
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And for that very reason,

1261
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
it's impermanent.

1262
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It will have to cease.

1263
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You have no say in its manifestation,

1264
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
which is why,

1265
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
it will cease.

1266
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
That's it.

1267
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
When that's recognized,

1268
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
then everything,

1269
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
whether it's particular or general,

1270
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
is seen through that principle.

1271
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And the sense,

1272
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and the very sense of self,

1273
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
arises depending on these things.

1274
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yes, they arise.

1275
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So then you recognize,

1276
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
because you recognize principle,

1277
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
then you got to anything,

1278
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
that manifests.

1279
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
For that reason,

1280
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
it's impermanent.

1281
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You, well,

1282
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
yourself manifests.

1283
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And big is,

1284
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
general, not specific yet,

1285
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
it's manifested as such,

1286
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
thus,

1287
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
it's impermanent.

1288
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It can, with me,

1289
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
it doesn't even occur anymore.

1290
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Oh, this is messy.

1291
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It cannot even be assumed.

1292
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Even be thought of,

1293
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
a fantasized,

1294
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
anymore as myself.

1295
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It's just inconceivable,

1296
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
becomes, when that principle is understood,

1297
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
which is about the system of Jiram

1298
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and, oh,

1299
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
she lost the dimension of her thought.

1300
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah, it's just...

1301
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Well, actually,

1302
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
she didn't quite lose it fully.

1303
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Back then,

1304
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
but she's clearly recognizing it,

1305
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
because if she lost it,

1306
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
she couldn't even remember it,

1307
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
in that sense.

1308
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Like, you can't even bring it back as a memory,

1309
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
because even the preview,

1310
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
the memory,

1311
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and the past,

1312
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
is seen,

1313
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
because impermanent,

1314
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
which means,

1315
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
yourself ceases to reside,

1316
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
even there.

1317
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So, the dimension,

1318
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
it's gone, it's gone.

1319
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So,

1320
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
sort of on it,

1321
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
cannot even remember,

1322
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
well,

1323
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
well,

1324
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
he can recognize what a father is,

1325
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
assuming,

1326
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
a father or a father is,

1327
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
but he cannot even conceive that,

1328
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
even as a memory.

1329
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
He knows, oh,

1330
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I used to do this.

1331
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I used to,

1332
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
like,

1333
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I used to think that I existed,

1334
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
independent of my senses,

1335
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
independent of my aggregates,

1336
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
but actually,

1337
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
how that,

1338
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
was experienced actually,

1339
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
it's inconceivable.

1340
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It cannot arise anymore.

1341
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Which is what passed

1342
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and the future

1343
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and the present

1344
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
is reflected,

1345
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
with it I knew.

1346
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So, a real key is

1347
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
seeing how,

1348
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
this sense of self,

1349
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
is dependent on,

1350
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
these rising and falling phenomena.

1351
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The standard view,

1352
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
for a protrusion,

1353
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I think,

1354
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
is that,

1355
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'm here solid,

1356
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and I'm experiencing all these things,

1357
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
and whether they come and go,

1358
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
or whether they come and go,

1359
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
or whether they come and go,

1360
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
or whether they come and go,

1361
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
or whether they come and go,

1362
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and that will be what?

1363
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So, that's what the mind

1364
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
by impermanence.

1365
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And the point is,

1366
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
no, the impermanence

1367
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
has to be personal,

1368
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
which means the impermanence

1369
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
has to pertain to that sense of self.

1370
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So, if you're contemplating something

1371
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
that's coming and going,

1372
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and you don't feel anything,

1373
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
is that's irrelevant?

1374
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You need to find the impermanence

1375
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
that will concern you,

1376
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
or rather,

1377
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
the thought of this thing,

1378
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
disappearing,

1379
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
will concern you.

1380
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Which is what I mean,

1381
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
impermanence,

1382
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
like,

1383
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
if you, like, seeing a thing,

1384
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
manifest,

1385
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and then seeing the destruction of the thing,

1386
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
it's actually another,

1387
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
another arising.

1388
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It's a manifestation,

1389
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
appearance,

1390
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
of a thing being,

1391
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
of a particular thing being disintegrated.

1392
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It's not a impermanence.

1393
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It's not,

1394
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
it's actually more arising.

1395
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It's a worldly type of impermanence

1396
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
in terms of things

1397
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
that have changed the shape,

1398
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
or whatever else,

1399
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
but,

1400
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
phenomenologically speaking,

1401
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
it's just another arising experience.

1402
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So,

1403
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you can't actually experience

1404
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
impermanence through your senses.

1405
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Any,

1406
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
in any way,

1407
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
you can't even conceal it.

1408
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
The true impermanence.

1409
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Because if you would,

1410
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
you would need the Buddha

1411
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
to tell you how to find the way out of the self-view.

1412
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
You just need to,

1413
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
as most of the mystics believe,

1414
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
and, hopefully,

1415
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
access it.

1416
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I threw,

1417
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
threw a vision,

1418
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
threw a mantle of another,

1419
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
and it's impossible.

1420
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So, instead of trying to see,

1421
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
disappearing,

1422
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
you recognize that the appearance

1423
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
is the disease,

1424
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
because of which,

1425
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
it's gone.

1426
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It will be gone,

1427
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
even if it isn't.

1428
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Because if it is,

1429
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
that's another experience

1430
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
that has a reason,

1431
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
because it has a reason,

1432
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
the impermanence is impermanent.

1433
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So,

1434
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
that's what you regarded as permanent,

1435
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
is also impermanent,

1436
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and even the impermanent things

1437
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
that you regarded before

1438
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
are even more impermanent.

1439
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So, it's just impermanence,

1440
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
and more impermanence,

1441
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
as opposed to impermanence,

1442
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and then,

1443
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
too much,

1444
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
of permanence.

1445
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Thank you.

1446
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Thank you.
