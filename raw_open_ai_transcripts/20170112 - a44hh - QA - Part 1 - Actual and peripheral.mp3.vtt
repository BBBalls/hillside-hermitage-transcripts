WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
But based on how I did yesterday, this session, I was thinking that the paper we were talking

00:10.000 --> 00:21.000
about can it be understood as the field on which the particular manifest?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes and no.

00:25.000 --> 00:34.000
Yes in a sense that, yeah, it is a particular arise on the basis of that more general or more

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
peripheral. That's really the sense basis for example I refer to as can be translated as

00:40.000 --> 00:45.600
fields with the same, in the same sense actually because the sense objects that arise on

00:45.600 --> 00:50.000
the particular level, they arise on the basis of the field of the eye.

00:50.000 --> 01:00.000
But the problem is, that's why it's yes, but it can be answered no if you give that field

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
some sort of priority over the particular, because that field is a negative phenomenon.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
It's defined by the things that arise particularly.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
So you can discern that there is a field because the eye objects are present,

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
because the particular things have a reason, the peripheral is generated because of that.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
It's defined because of that. So it's not independent of the particular.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
So I mean the question you asked is valid, but sometimes it can be asked in a sense of which is first,

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
which is more important, which is greater and in that sense I have to be able to answer

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
because then people just think, okay so there is this field and then things arise upon the field

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
but if you think like that, you're taking that field to be the particular,

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
which means something else is then very thorough in regard to that thought of that very defined field.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
So it's one thing to understand it, the level of your mind sort of thinking intellectually

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
and it's important to clarify as much as you can.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
But as I said, if you want to recognize it as the actual phenomena that fill these,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
there is always generated on the basis of the current particular.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
That's how you start, like you just mindfulness or present situation of the body and so on

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
and then based on that, this is already there, so you just need to discern it

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
and then recognize that which you have intellectually grasped beforehand.

02:29.000 --> 02:40.000
Because now you have sort of the information and the data to sort of identify things as they are in this certain manner.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
So in that sense, in that sense, yes, things arise on the basis of the field

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
but in return that field is defined by the things that arise on the basis of it.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
So what you have, number of the term is Vinyana,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
it as much as Vinyana, the term is number of two sticks holding each other.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
One is not more than the other and one cannot even be conceived

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
with the other being simultaneously present.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
And that's how, by full understanding that there is absolutely no room

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
for the sense of self or the appropriation to remain there

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
because it becomes completely redundant.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
The whole picture, these two sticks, they don't need any master operator.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Basically, they support each other for as long as the five aggregates are present,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
things will be arising and manifesting and defining itself, defining everything.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
And everything else will continue operating, so to speak.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
The intention and the volition, all that would stay,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
but what wouldn't stay is the owner of it, because there's no room for the owner.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
The owner is part of the stick, so what can you own?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Can you own the left stick?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
If it's being supported by the right one, you can't.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
You realize, well, I think I own it.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
If the right stick goes, the left one cannot stay.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Can you own the right stick?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
If it's being held by the left one.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And you can't hold them both at the same time,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
because that will imply you stepping outside of your experience

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
and then taking up the hold of its foundations, which you can't do there.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
So that's the practice, basically.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
That's the big personal in that sense. It's that repetition of that contemplation

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
of this mutual dependence on these things whereby,

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
by fully discerning that, you automatically squeeze out any sense of appropriation itself,

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
because it's just inconceivable to be there at the same time.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
It becomes redundant, completely.

04:26.000 --> 04:38.000
So, if you use the approach of Salayatina, the sense basis, yes,

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
they're the negative, they're the base, they're the field.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And I think the old translations of Nyanimalitera,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
the first was, well, he was so then experimenting with it at some point,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
it was the field, the field.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I think the video is as well referring to it as such.

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
Because from yesterday, when I was meditating,

05:02.000 --> 05:11.000
I actually realized that it seems that all the Salayatanas are all the time operating

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
and your attention just pick up one small piece,

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
so you have one moment from that whole inconceivable amount of possibilities

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
and you actually have no idea what will come in the next moment.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Or you have a very limited idea.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And that limit is given to you by the thing beforehand.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
So, in that sense, you're not in a control, even of that idea.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
So, you just come right after votes.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
So, you think it's all going to be set up?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah. And you just come on the scene.

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
And it is the six sense basis,

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
these six fields of possibilities, the six negative, six peripherals,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
if that's the approach you take,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
yeah, they are simultaneously present there all the time.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
And your attention, obviously, lies on the basis of one particular moment.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
We die, thought, whatever takes your fancy or presses you the hardest.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yes.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
And can you explain what keeps the narrative?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Well, the narrative, yes, organising.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Yes, exactly. The narrative is kept by the mind,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
because the five senses meet in the mind.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
So, the mind does, for its own object,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
has the overview of the five senses.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
That's how they're intelligible.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Now, you have a protugener has an extra layer of narrative,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
which is his act of other.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And he senses self.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
That adds a whole, another assumed dimension of another point of view

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
that's external to all of this.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Like, the mind, that's just other hand as well.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Like, he has a narrative, he has a context.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
He can still operate and talk, and discern, and choose, and prefer,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
because the mind is where the senses meet.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Obviously, the mind cannot be overwhelmed by the senses anymore.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
So, nothing that he chooses or prefers would be based on anything unwholesome.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
But for protugener, he has assumed another completely gratuitous dimension of

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
his sense of self being independent of both that mind and all those senses.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It's just completely outside.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
It's holding both of the sticks, because that's the idea of the self.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
That's the notion of self.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
That's the meaning of it, the mastery, you are in charge.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
So, you can see how much more complex than the narrative becomes,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
and much more unpredictable as well.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
And that's exactly why having the sense of self results in suffering.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Because you're trying your sort of acting as if you are the center of experience,

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
yet at every single experience you have, that is being undermined through the very experience.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
So, that's why if a protugener would stop engaging in the world,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
stop engaging in the desires, practicing the strength,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
going to close himself in a little cell, in a little room,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
first it would be the boredom they would come.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
And then it would be a shared dread of fear.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And many people would lose their minds.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
If there is nothing, nothing, taking away that fear.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Why? Because they remain holding.

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
They cannot not hold to their sense of self, to their assumed external entity, really.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
That it's just being now crushed from every possible conceivable direction.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And he recognizes the prospect of it, he feels it.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
That's why it's so terrifying.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
That's why when the protugener would talk to the Buddha sometimes,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
and he would tell what he teaches,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
they would understand what he, they would understand the dispression,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
the point of view of Nibbana,

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
like abandoning it all before it's taken away.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
But they wouldn't let go of the sense of self.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So then that understanding would completely make them go mad.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
They would fall on the ground over their hair, be their breast,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
basically full on panic attack and dread.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Because they don't let go of the self.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
Yet they understood clearly that all these things,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
they've come to an end that's our phones.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
Yet if the self owns means self will be owning its ending as well.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
The ending of those things, but it can't.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
So you realize the self will be destroyed.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And then they would lament and say what that will destroy us.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
That will kill us.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
There will be nothing left.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Because in their mind it's the self,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
that sort of governs all these things.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
It seems that this approach can relate this thing, this thing.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
And this thing is that notion of self,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
because if you realize how broad,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
and you think that it's not just your particular experience,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
but there is that whole thing is around,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
which you can't control.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Probably it's a bad word.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I know what you mean, but it probably is equal.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
It will extinguish that dimension

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
that is being gratuitously maintained and generated

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
as an external dimension to the whole experience,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
and the self abides and lives as the master, as the God.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Once you start noticing that that dimension,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
it's already peripheral,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
that has peripheral to it,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
you realize there is no outside to you.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Because when you think outside,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
that's the experience inside.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So even your thoughts of external

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
are experienced right here right now in turn of.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Which means you can't step outside of your experience.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
And that's not hard to grasp on the intellectual.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It kind of makes sense.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
But drilling it long enough until the mind stops

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
sort of wavering and going out of it,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
even with those kind of careless lazy thinking assumptions,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
that will take time.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
But the more you do it,

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
the more sort of your kind of,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
well, as I said, you're sort of fading away

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
that notion of external dimension.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Because no matter what external dimension you're thinking,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
presently right now, mindfully,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
you realize that's already surrounded by its own peripheral,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
which means it cannot be the ultimate external,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
which means it cannot be the ultimate owner,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
the ultimate self, the ultimate God, the ultimate anyway.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
It's all a reason on the basis of the particular experience.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And then it was, yeah, that was the whole point.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
It was just that little kind of careless way

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
of attending to things assuming the external

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
to yourself, to your experience,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
to others, doesn't matter.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
There was enough, there was enough for his whole mess

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
of some sort, nothing else.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
That's why ignorance and wrong views

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
the most plain word you think, nothing else.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
And also, that's why careless attention

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
is in the beginning of the whole.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
And that's why somebody just sort of stops gradually,

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
fades away, the assuming of that external dimension.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
He basically stops assuming the art of other.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
That is actually what art of other is.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
So, he becomes free from the factor of the self-review.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
So, isn't so that,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Ionisomanasitara is actually in regards

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
to these things we are talking about.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Yes, Ionisomanasitara, Ionisom is womb.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So, basically, the root, the beginning.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
So, you could see, if the normal attention

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
is attention, it's usually completely focused upon the object.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
And even if it steps away from the object into more general picture,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
it makes that an object.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
So, always, the measure for ordinary Ionisomanasitara

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
is the object, that's it.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
It doesn't see anything simultaneously present

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
that's peripheral to that attended object.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
But if it starts to train itself

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
to start noticing other things while

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
it is still attending the present object,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
whatever object is, whatever the sense

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
there might have been, sort of, most dominant.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
If it starts noticing those particular

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
without making them into a new object,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
you keep your old attention, so to speak, on the object.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And simultaneously, while that is present,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
you start noticing other things that they are simultaneously present

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
but not the object.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
So, basically, you start trying to mind

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
to discern other things different from that

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
which you are used to discerning, which is only an object.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
So, it's the same, through the same attention,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
you start looking at the origins of that object.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
What's behind it?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
What's around it?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
What's higher than it?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
The nature or the structure?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, so you start looking at the structure of it.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
You start looking at the womb from which it all originated.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
So, that's why it's young.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
It's a monasticity.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
It's a proper attention.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
It's not like people often

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
to state proper attention improperly

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
or rather lazily and carelessly,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
whereby it just means like,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
oh, it's a wholesome attention.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
It's just when you attend good.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
And you think, no, it's much more precise than that.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
That's why it's such a fundamental aspect.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
It's like one of the factors for the right view.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Equal important as the word of the Buddha.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
So, you can have all the words of the Buddha

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
and all the Buddhas.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
If you have no proper attention,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
none of that will make sense or take root.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
So, basically, discerning the structure

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
through their reason thing,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
without sort of making it into a new thing,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
because then the structure is somewhere else.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yes.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
So, basically, that's how you train your attention

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
to become proper attention.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
So, it attends to whatever attend,

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
but it sees beyond it.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Yes.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
So, it doesn't get locked on to just the face value

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
of the reason thing.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yes.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yes.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I still feel that there is actually a danger

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
that instead of, like, seeing the structure,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
you just set back and you want the broader...

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Well, it has to start like that.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
It has to start like that.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
But as long as you know that you will be supposed

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
to be seeing the peripheral in regard to whatever,

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
it's currently present.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
So, yes.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
You set back, you broaden the experience,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
but then that becomes particular.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Isn't it?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
But then through that,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
you keep this turning further.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
But if there is no entry,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
it's infinite, in that sense.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
You can keep doing that as much as you like.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And the whole point of doing it is to start

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
discerning that principle,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
field, and the thing that isn't upon the field,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
that defines field in its return.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yes.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
So, that's why, in some sense,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
you don't necessarily have to have,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
kind of, greatly developed,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
mind to discerne the principle of,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
but it's some other of that interdependence.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
You don't need to,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
because you can discerne the principle

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
upon very basic things,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
but you discerne the same principle.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yes.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
There is this.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
There is this.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yes.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
With this, this is.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Yes.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
This is present, this is present, that's it.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
So, when there is a field,

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
for things to be sort of arisen upon,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
things arise upon it,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
which in return define that field

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
as that which they are not at the time,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
they are arisen upon it.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
So, it's fully mutually determining each other,

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
and you realize that's how everything works, in that sense.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
So, yes, in a way,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
but it isn't quite explaining how everything works.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
In a very direct,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
insightful manner,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
where if you understand it,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
you automatically stop

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
regarding things as you are.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
You're automatically free from yourself.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
So, you're basically,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
if you fully develop it,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
you become an arunt.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
But it doesn't explain it in a sense

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
of telling you what's happening,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
and it provides us an explanation.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It kind of requires time,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
and it's sort of linear

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
and successful things,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
and when this changes,

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
and this goes ahead,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
as I say, oh, yeah,

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
they really, that's right there,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
they really make sense of something like that.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
It's much more precise than that.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
So, it's not necessarily wrong.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I mean, it is actually.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
It is wrong in a sense that,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
but this one,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
but it should be taken as a precise thing,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
because then people will take it seriously,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
and then try to discern this very thing.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
But it's very, very hard to discern,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
as you can see for yourself.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Now, you're starting to get the idea,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
what it refers to,

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
but actually, discerning it,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
and then discerning this relationship,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
is just the same principle,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
because every participant starts

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
with this, this is,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
and then we watch what is,

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
and then it carries on

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
into 12 factors,

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
or 16 factors,

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
or 8 factors,

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
depending on how the book describes it,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
on different occasions.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
But it's the same principle

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
that's being described.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
So, you could see,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
what kind of understanding

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
would be required to see that principle

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
in all those intricate ways

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
of relating to each other,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
as the book that would have described,

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
but it's not part of the birth

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
and everything else,

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
as phenomena.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
But the good news is,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
you don't have to.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
All you have to do is see the principle,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
which is basically nothing else,

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
and saying,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
oh, yes, whatever has a reason,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
for that reason,

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
it's impermanent.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I understand, basically,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
if you really see the principle,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
then do the village

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
or extinguish that notion of art?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Yes.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
That's why it was said,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
in the suitors,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Sariputra said,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I think,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
one who sees the,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Sariputra said,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
one who sees Dhamma,

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
sees Patit Sampada.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
One who sees Patit Sampada,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
sees the Dhamma here.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yes.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
And you realize,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
also,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
it must be

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
as important,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
as any other,

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
kind of directly relevant aspect of the Dhamma.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
But the problem is,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
there's so much,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
obviously, wrong notions,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
explanations, views,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
based upon Patit Sampada today.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
So,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
it's probably embedded

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
if people don't bother with it,

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
in that sense,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
try to figure it out,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
because it's,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
because there's so much out,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
it's quite likely

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
they'll be pulled to one wrong side

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
or the other,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
and end up doing it wrongly.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
It's not,

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
it's not necessarily

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
crucial,

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
or the deal breaker,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
if person still remains authentic,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
and knows why they're practicing

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
and what,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
what's supposed to sort of

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
be uprooted

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
with the understanding,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
they'll figure it out eventually.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
But,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
it's really not not necessary.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Just understand the principle.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Don't worry about it.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
12 or 8 or 16,

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
whichever way they will describe it,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
you don't worry about it.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Just understand the two sticks supporting each other.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Just understand,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
peripheral and actual,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
actual peripheral.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Yes.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Because fully understanding it

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
will leave no room

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
for the sense of self to be assumed at.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
And that's all.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
The self was never there,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
as you can see,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
yet,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
by not knowing that he's there,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
so the presence

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
of not knowledge,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
of non-knowledge,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
that self cannot be there,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
the presence of that phenomena,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
places the self there

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
to the extent of that phenomena.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
So if you had not knowledge,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
that self cannot be there,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
was great,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
quite sort of spread around your experience,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
yourself,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
is to the same extent spread about.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
So you're fully responsible for it.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Then consequently,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
fully understood,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
fully removing the non-knowledge,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
replacing with knowledge,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
that self cannot be anywhere there,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
the self is not anywhere there.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
And that's why there is the element of nibbana

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
in Putujana's experience.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
It's nothing other than say

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
there's a possibility of him

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
to achieve nibbana,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
to free himself from himself.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And then it's possible

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
because the structure

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
can never be actually penetrated

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
or affected by the self.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
If it were,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
then means the self

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
would have some input.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
And it would be.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It would be a sort of a master.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
But it's not.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
But until you know that,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
then it is.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yes.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
That's why you said,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Upadana is not a five aggregates.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Not all of them,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
not even one of them,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
not even bits of them,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
nothing.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
But there is no Upadana without them.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
So it's in regard to them.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
In the same self,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
in the same sense,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
the self is in regard to the experience as a whole.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But it's not actually there,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
which is why for Putujana,

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
who doesn't question itself,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
he assumes it elsewhere.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I external to the whole thing.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Once you take that away,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
then you realize,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
as well,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
it cannot be elsewhere.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
So you can't hide there.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Certainly you can't fit in here.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Then it fades.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
You left it no choice.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
So that's why you kind of indirectly,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
you keep shutting down

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
the escape routes

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
for the assumption of the self.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
You can't directly stop assuming.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
That's when an environment

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
sees it,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
the origin needs to be unscrewed.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
You can't just knock it out as a peg.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Knock it out as a peg.
