00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
What is an elinquishment in giving up?

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
What do you need to give up? Why? What does it mean? Why is it necessary?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
So what practically? What are the things you have to give up?

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Did you actually step to trying to relinquish for sake?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Trying to manage the suffering?

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Okay, so if you're not trying to manage suffering but you still live with your spouse, children,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
can you keep that and then give up management?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Can there be an arhat and light in the freedom of suffering?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Probably not.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
So there are certain things you have to give up, give up.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
So where is the line with the things you have to give up, give up?

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
Maybe you should try to understand what things you don't really need,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
or you can live without them and then...

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, that's a good idea.

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
Basically, do you evaluate what is necessary to have, what isn't, and then start there.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
But obviously sometimes that can result, not that specifically,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
but people can have a view in regards to that whereby they think,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
okay, so if I give everything up, I'll be free.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
So they don't use any discernment or reason to see where the line is

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
and just start throwing everything away, so to speak.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
And yeah, that might result in a very simple life, but fundamentally,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
you cannot do that with your own body and your own senses,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
and that's where the problem is.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
You can't just discard like you can items that you possess.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
So that needs to be understood while it is still there.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
So while you still have it, you need to understand how you cannot have it really,

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
without destroying it, without blaming the eyes or ears for hearing or seeing and so on.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
People often think, if I like something, I should give it up.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
So for example, if... I should give up my likes.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
Yes, whatever food is my preference, for example, I should stop eating that food.

02:22.000 --> 02:30.000
Is that a valid...? Is it? No.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Because that's not what the problem is.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
The problem is not that something is agreeable to you,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
because if things are...

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
the problem is that you can't see the line between something being agreeable

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
and you needing to have it and needing to keep it and wanting it,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
or being enslaved by it, or being dependant on it.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
So just because something is agreeable to you,

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
that you have a preference for something doesn't mean you have to relinquish it.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
What if you're emotionally attached to it?

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
You're going to be miserable if you don't get what you like.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Should you give it up then?

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
So sometimes I think yes, it can help,

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
but then there's obviously a limit to that.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
You can't give up all food just because you can't stop having some kind of desire in regard to food.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
But would it be okay that somebody gives up only food that they like

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
and only stuff that they don't like?

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
Would that result in growing their mind?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
No. Why not?

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Because it's still acting out of likes and dislikes.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Just denying, just doing the opposite.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Right, but they're not feeding their likes anymore.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
They're not eating the stuff they like, the only stuff that they don't like.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Yes, but they're acting out of the same thing.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Your preference?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Just turning it the other way.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
The preference towards the liking food?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yes, the taste.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh, sure.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
And what else is a problem there?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
The belief that the problem is in the taste.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Exactly.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Your preference, your like, your emotional dependence was not in the taste.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
So yes, there is a practical line there.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
As in, if you have no perspective, then maybe give it up.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Don't eat that, just to see whether your mind will be disturbed and how much.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
But fundamentally, yes, that is not where the problem is.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
The problem is in the desire and lust that's infecting your thoughts,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
not the sense objects.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
And that's where the uprooting, that's where the true relinquishment happens.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
But in order to even kind of comprehend that direction,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
yes, some practical physical relinquishment needs to be done,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
needs to be actually performed.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So yeah, references.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Of course, the precepts, things you would give up through the precepts.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
And then further than that, yeah, you can, you know, everybody can get really inspired

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
with the idea of your still life and then just start throwing everything out.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
But now that can become an issue.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
You might be just acting out of a view that implies that problem was in these things,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
not in my desire and lust on the mental level.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
But if on the other hand you use some practical kind of reasoning,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
as I will do, I really need this.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Can I live without it?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Certainly it's better to be less cluttered.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Certainly it's better to go in the direction of relinquishment and simplification.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And then fine, then if you decide that things can be dismissed,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
given up, given away, that's all right.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
But you still keep the perspective that the problem is actually fundamental

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
on the level of the mind taking up those things,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
the mind taking up the preferences with lust,

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
leaning towards them with lust, with aversion and so on.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
What kind of relinquishment then?

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
Because the sutta says basically that pretty much the prerequisite

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
for establishing your mind and dwelling in jhana is the complete relinquishment.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
And even Satipatana, which is generally the practice of mindfulness,

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
presupposes overcoming happiness and concerns in regard to the entire world.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And then you can dwell mindfully.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
So that's also a form of relinquishment.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
To what extent?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I mean, I don't need to ask to what extent.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I just said it, the entire world.

06:40.000 --> 06:50.000
But what would be the practical examples of giving up

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
an overcoming happiness and relinquishment in regard to the entire world?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
So you keep the precepts, you're not engaging with centrality,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
but there is still obviously more to the world.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
What are the other things you have to give up practically,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
not just metaphorically,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
in order to be able to surmount the world,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
to surmount the concern regarding the world,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
in order to be able to dwell correctly, mindful,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
in order to experience that vowsaga that suttas talk about,

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
that then you are truly detached from the realm of thinking and pondering.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
The mind is withdrawn from it, and that is the first jhana.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
What are those things you have to give up?

07:28.000 --> 07:35.000
Obviously, core centrality, core seal will, chore, indulgency food, of course,

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
and company, of course, but what else now?

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
There is more to that, obviously.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
Maybe it's indulgence and thought, I'd say,

07:49.000 --> 07:58.000
to put too much value on sort of arranging things.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
If you see that this ultimately is futile,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I mean, recognizing that there is a kindrance.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
You mean like arranging things on the level of the thought?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yes.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Sort of controlling it or making it whatever?

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Yeah, sort of, yeah, quieting it.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, but see the problem with that could be that somebody can do that

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
before they got the right view.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
So they are quieting their mind down with ignorance.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
So they still don't know the escape, but they start valuing the non-disturbance.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
But seeking the practice is disturbing, but it's a good type of disturbance

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
because it can result in the right view,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
that can then result in complete liberation.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
We spoke about it relatively often when somebody,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
and even the Buddha himself, said that the two types of thought,

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
like he would first realize how the problem is the unwholesome thoughts,

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
not thought in itself, then he put them into two categories.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Anything that's greed, aversion, delusion, he would not engage with,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
a non-greed, non-version, delusion, he would allow.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
And when greed, aversion, delusion present himself,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
he would not try to get rid of it, get rid of it,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
but he would just remind himself of the context, of the peril,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
of the danger, of how little satisfaction,

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
how this is intending for his harm, for harm of others, for harm of all,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
then those thoughts would subside on their own.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
And that was his practice, and that was not peaceful.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
That was still work, that was still burden,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
obviously on the right level of enduring these thoughts,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
pressuring you, not acting out,

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
and then re-establishing the context in regard to them, until they subside.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
When he fully developed that, completely,

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
sort of, when all he had was the good, non-greed, non-aversion, non-delusion,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
he was still maintaining the context, and then he realized,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
oh, but yeah, I don't need to do this now,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
because these thoughts are not harmful.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
So what if I just don't let them be?

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh, and by the way, there was that difference in that Madhima Agama,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
in that Sutta.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
In Pali, he doesn't really, he just goes into Second Jhana.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
But this explains how he was first intentionally involved

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
with maintaining the context and doing that Bhavana

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
in regard to the unwholesome states, until they subside.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Then after that, when he had wholesome states endure,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
he realized, oh, I don't need to be intentionally involved

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
with this context constantly, because these thoughts are not contradicting it,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
not going against it.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
And then he, oh, what if I allow these thinking and pondering, basically, to be?

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
And instead, just unify my mind internally on the basis of this wholesome environment

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
that I have work for.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
And then he entered the first Jhana.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
And then furthermore, then goes into Second.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
So that was, like, missing step I was talking about,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
that you wouldn't find in the Pali Sutta.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
So that's the point.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
So, like, yes, you shouldn't be, or, like, you know,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
if somebody is trying to control the thoughts and make any plan,

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
yeah, you've got to recognize that it's not going to lead to a solution.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
But at the same time, thoughts are not a problem.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
First Jhana is thinking and pondering entirely.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
And it's the peaceful sublime abiding that's sufficient for Arahantship,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
when the mind is totally withdrawn from it.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
So the problem is whether those thoughts are alluding,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
greater version delusion, distraction, cruelty, and so on.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
And those are now subtle things that I was leading to

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
by asking what are the other less subtle things you need to give up

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
before you can start discerning these roots of your thoughts

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
in regard to the world.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
So given the core sensuality is gone, you know,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
cruelty, acting out of anger is gone.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
What are the things that are not gone?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
There's worldly gain, renown, status, position.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
So basically kind of your relationship with others,

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
your ideas, the connections, comparisons.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Go on.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, I was going to suggest that it would then come down to the level of views,

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
relinquishing the dependence on,

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
well, what come down to different types of wrong views in regard to the world.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
So how would one practically relinquish views in regard to the world,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
relinquish dependencies on the notions of others and so on?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
What do you practically need to do?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Can you just start thinking about those things

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
and relinquish them by figuring them out?

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
Or you do need to increase that certain level of withdrawal from certain things.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
In the same sense, precepts withdraw you from certain unwholesome behaviors

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
by body and speech.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, it seems to me that this desire for gain and renown and status and position

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
is all bound to the self view as well.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Like, you know, there's got to be a self image here, or a notion of self here,

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
which then, you know, will, and then there will be others

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
and then there's this comparison, better, worse and all the rest of it.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah, that's all kind of the result of it.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
But as I said, in order to come to that, which is a problem, what do you need to give up?

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Your household life.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
In a way, yeah, more specifically.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Or the lightning company.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
There you go.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Basically, the lightning company, as in...

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
But what does it mean to delight the company?

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, we can get to that as well, actually, because it doesn't just mean...

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
Because people can think, oh, Buddha said seclusion, and I'm always in seclusion,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
but the real reason is because I really have ill will towards everybody else.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And it's like, well, that's not the seclusion, because you're not secluded.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
The Buddha said the true seclusion, like the one dwells in company even when he's alone,

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
if his mind is not free from greed, ill will and delusion.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
So, yes, physical seclusion is necessary,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
but the reason why you do it is even more necessary, more important.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
So, physical withdrawal, not seeking company, not finding delight in company,

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
kind of, yeah, that would diminish you referencing yourself from the point of view of company and others.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
You're distracting yourself from the, again, point of view of company.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
What other things in regard to the world?

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Like this, how would you abandon concerns in regard to the world?

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
What do you need to give up? What makes you concerned regarding the entire world and people and so on?

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
So, we're talking about giving up central behaviour, ill will.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Okay, what else do you do on the level of your senses with the world?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
How are you engaging with the world?

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
So, through company, what are the things?

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
Well, I suppose, seeking information about it, seeking...

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Exactly.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:44.000
Engaging with the level of information, news, distraction, views on the level of ideals that pertain to regard to the world,

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
the world, better place, all of that needs to be abandoned, just to begin Satipatana, rightly.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Because those are all factual concerns.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
They might not be apparent to somebody who is also, like, crowded with sensuality and household life and so on.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Once you withdraw yourself from that, yeah, that's where the mind will revolve around.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Those are the underlying basis there.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And that's why, even like the...

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
When Buddha describes a monk, obviously, with the right view, he says,

15:10.000 --> 15:19.000
a skilled monk, a noble disciple, abandoned, having been withdrawn physically from these sensuality, aversion, ill will,

15:19.000 --> 15:26.000
he abandons thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of cruelty, thoughts of harming.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Then he abandons, like, they kind of concede a course.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
Then he also abandons thoughts of his own, like, clanhood and homeland.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
And basically, on the level of, now, that's where your concede is, who you are in that broader sense.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
So, pretty much concerning, you know, that the level of the world as us humans, he abandons even those thoughts.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Again, not by denying them, not by trying to get rid of them,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
but by, okay, I have those thoughts now and during in this mind.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
Well, let me establish the same context I was established for when he came to sensuality.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
These thoughts lead to more concede, more suffering, more burden.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
Whenever there is identity, where the traces of identity or full-blown identity,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
dukkha will find the footing.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Thus, by thinking these thoughts, I am not inclining this mind towards peace,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
I am inclining it towards harm, towards myself, towards others, towards everything else.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
And that's that, so you have to give up.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
And you wouldn't be able to give up these thoughts if you're still in company of others,

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
spending your time talking about politics and kings and worlds and ministers,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
as the suitors would mention.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Well, we have the present equivalent of that.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Reading news, reading information, keeping in touch with happenings,

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
even if not necessarily, you know, political or something, but just in the world of science,

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
in the world of art, in the world of it, in the world of full stop,

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
means you still have certain connections to it internally.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And that's truly where the problem is.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
And for as long as those things are not given up on their external level,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
these thoughts will not be seen for what they are, the subtle ones.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
And even the duty towards the family.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
I mean, the whole point of the homeless life was leaving it all behind.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
So, like, you know, many monks would be kind of,

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
but it's still, it's my duty towards family, my own family.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
It's like, well, to that extent, you will not be abandoning thoughts of your clanshood

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
and belonging and caste and wherever you come from,

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
because you are still taking on that external duty

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
through which you're maintaining this internal identity.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
It has to be, I am alone in this world

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
for which I have no more happiness nor concern.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
And the reason that you would have no more happiness or concern in regard to the world

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
is precisely because you would see also this, for example,

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
you know, if you get bothered by, like, war going on in the world

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
or poverty going on in the world or things going on,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
but you see what is the root cause of any of those things,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
greed, aversion, delusion, for example.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
So if you're taking, if you see where that problem is rightly in yourself,

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
you could not be concerned whatsoever with anything that goes on with the world.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
You're taking that seriously.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
That is why you are concerned with the world.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Exactly, because you are not.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Because of those things that are root of all these problems and concerns

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
and seeking the safety and so on.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
So that needs to be relinquished as well.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
There's that, obviously, mundane right view

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
and that wrong view that says, there is no mother, there's no father,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
no world, no next world, nothing.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
No next world, there's nothing, there's no given.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You know, it doesn't really exist.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
See, I'm not identified with any of those things.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Thus, it's right.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
But that's actually the wrong.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
It's upside down, yeah.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
There is mother, there is father, there is family.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
And you have overcome the concern in regard to it.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
You have denied it or got rid of them or threw them out

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
like you would throw your possessions.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
And that's the point.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
That's what I mean, like, oh, so you can't throw out the world.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You can't throw out your senses, or well, you can,

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
but you would still equally be bound by those domains, by those consciousness.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
You're not free.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
What you can do is overcome.

19:20.000 --> 19:26.000
That basis, for concern, for lust, for aversion, for this right,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
for needing the safety, the basis, basically,

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
that's keeping you from your mind from being liberated from it.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
But as I said, it's roots are on the mental level,

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
but in order to arrive at that, certain practical giving-ups need to be done.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
So, like refraining from seeking out information,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
engaging, discussing these things.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
They're like, yeah, but I mean, I can, but there's no end to this.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And there's, but there must be, why?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Because you feel insecure and unsafe.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Well, does it come from the world, the lack of safety,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
or does it come from a mind that's not liberated?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
You're making a choice there.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
If you act towards the world, well, you got your answer.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
You might claim that you are still practicing for liberation.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
You're not.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
You had a crossroads and you perpetually keep choosing back onto the world.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
And that's exactly how you would go beyond the central domain,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
not by suppressing it so it doesn't come up anymore,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
nor by literally you stepping out.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
So you see it over there and you see how safe you are,

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
because that thing cannot not, it can only be over there and you know that.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
That's what it said, like in the first jhana,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
the thoughts are assailed by perceptions of sensuality

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
that you basically withdrawn yourself from,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
because that's kind of what's in front, but you are outside now.

20:48.000 --> 20:58.000
And sometimes there are concerns to it that being withdrawn

20:58.000 --> 21:06.000
from all these talks and whatever may produce an impression on others

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
that you are avoiding them, that you are hostile to them maybe,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
and even in monastic environment as well.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
So basically you have to take it on as your responsibility.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
You have to accept it, because some people will probably see it that way.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
So you have to accept that, yeah, well that's,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
and see that's why people would keep in touch.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Oh, that's touch base.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Let's just keep seeing and talking to each other every day

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
so we all see that we are all right,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
because I mean we still might be all right,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
but the fact that somebody is now withdrawn from it,

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
the mind starts thinking, what if they are not all right?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
What if they are upset with me?

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
It's like, well, yeah, there is no end to that proliferation.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
The only end to that proliferation is to recognize,

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
okay, well, have I done anything by body speech and mind to make them upset?

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
No? Then okay, then this mind that's trying to make me go back there

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
to make sure nobody is upset with me,

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
I will restrain, I will re-establish context in regard to it

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
until those thoughts subside.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
All if upon reviewing you're like, oh yeah, no, I did act a bit like this

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
like that, well, then go and apologize, sort it out.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
But still, do not use whether you feel good or bad as a criteria

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
whether you should act, but actually use your reflection

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
and see whether there was anything done by body speech towards them

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
to make them upset.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
If not, then you've got to endure the irrational mind

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
that's trying to get you out of the solitude

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
and seek safety in your tribe.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
And that is the thoughts of, oh, what will my peers,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
what will my clan, what is my family,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
what does my brothers think of me?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Those are the factual concerns.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
It's not like these random kind of abstract thoughts

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
that a skilled monk would have.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
No, it's like on the level of sensuality and ill will,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
that now you abandoned, well, what took their place

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
are thoughts about who you are, who you were,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
how others see you, your past,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
it's going to have that same weight.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
And now you practice that right context in regard to it,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
which means it's not always going to feel pleasant

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
in the same sense, practicing the context against the,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
you know, I don't know, sensual pull

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
or acting out of a version won't feel pleasant.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
That's also quite directly related to being unable

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
to see wholesome as wholesome and unwholesome as unwholesome

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
because measuring yourself, what I should do

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
or what I shouldn't do, did I act wrongly or not,

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
on the level of, what will my clan,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
the people I admire, the people I whatever,

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
what will they think of me, is basically,

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
in the beginning you might need to use the advice

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
of wise people to send you in a good direction,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
but at some point you need to be able to discern

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
for yourself what is acting wholesome,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
what is acting unwholesome, and not depend on basically

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
and when you do those thoughts will still come.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Because that's what the mind does.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
It still has the habits rooted in those subtler forms

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
of lasting aversion.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
But yeah, if you have the right reference,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
you won't be acting out of how those thoughts make you feel.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
You won't be acting out of doubt, in other words.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
You would know whether to know, I'll go ahead and do this

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
and re-establish the context until subside on its own,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
subsides on its own, or, oh yeah, no, okay,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
I should actually make some effort externally

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
to sort the issues I created,

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
and then go back to this either way.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
I remember one discussion with Monk about it,

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
and well, basically he was referring to the Buddha himself,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
talking, having small talks basically,

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
when somebody comes to him and they exchange some greeting.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah, pleasantries and stuff.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Yeah, pleasant talks.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
So how to understand, where is the limit to it?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
The reason behind.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
See, they came and started small talk for the other purpose,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
so it's like a way of expressing sort of friendliness,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
and then it would go into a point.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
So he wouldn't have a small talk for the sake of distraction,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
for the sake of non-perspective,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
for the sake of greed or aversion.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
He wouldn't have the small talk for the sake of carelessness.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
So yeah, that's what it is.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Maybe one can say that well,

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
as long as one sees that these talks really produce some...

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
One main thing is that as long as one realises one is not the Buddha,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
not even an arahan, one will not understand

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
how can an arahan have a small talk.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
So until then, maybe take the small talk seriously in that sense,

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
do it only like as I said, as a way of relating to others,

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
but not more, not less, not make a big deal out of it either.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm going to stop talking to me and get angry with everyone

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
who says good morning to you or something.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
But fundamentally recognise, yeah, I don't know where the line is,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
because if I did, I would have the right view

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
and be on the verge of arahantship and so on.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
And when I am, then I'll figure out how can the Buddha speak

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
with kings about seemingly pointless stuff.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
So there is that order of things.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
So could the cruelty and being that as long as I know

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
that this sort of talks is sort of unwholesome to me at least,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I should refrain from them.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
If you know what unwholesome is, like not like all,

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
I don't like this, that doesn't necessarily mean it's unwholesome.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
No, I mean, I say producing all these concerns and I mean,

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
there are some, I say, innocent talk about politics.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I know that you are stepping in.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Yeah, and then...

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
I think that's an oxymoron.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
No, no, sure, yeah, of course.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Like if I don't want my mind going there,

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
yeah, you don't have to talk to it.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
And if people keep insisting, then you basically stop associating with them.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's as simple as that.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Because yeah, you know, just general household life,

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
that those are the factual, real life concerns

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
and they should not pertain.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
That's why, like even in the suttas, you know,

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
when monks would sort of put each other down,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
they would say like, ah, you can't take him seriously.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
He's intimate with householders.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
He has householders for his friends.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Means he's not a proper monk.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
That's all he took.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Having householders is your friends.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
Because you kind of share their concerns by implication.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
But then there were cases of other hands having householders for their friends.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
So in and of itself, as I said, that's not where the root of the problem is.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
But most practically, for most people,

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
yeah, that has to be restrained until you actually approve it.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
And then to what extent you'll engage in those talks afterwards,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
you'll see, but it won't be done for the sake of distraction or whatever else.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Or out of sea.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Like, I don't really care about the politics,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
but I care what others think about me.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
And now they want to talk politics.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
And if I don't think bad about me, so I'll talk politics or whatever they want to talk.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Well, that's equally unwholesome.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
So I'm acting out of that weakness.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
No, I need to take on the weight.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
Yeah, they might talk badly about me behind my back.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
That's fine.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
And that's part of relinquishing my concern, my conceit defined by others.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
It's not going to be pleasant because it was something you accrued and lived by.

28:21.000 --> 28:41.000
So it's who you are, pretty much.
