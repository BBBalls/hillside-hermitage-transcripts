1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
So, did you ever not talk about it?

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,760
I was thinking maybe you had something in mind since you don't get to come here often,

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,760
I'll be living here.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,600
Unless you want to just hear me ask.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Yeah, that would be all right.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
He's been asking us today for a few days, you told me.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,840
So one thing I was just curious about, how your interpretation about a certain suit that

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,640
this is from the Sun Utinakaya, I think Kanda Sunita, it's the one where the buddha compares

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,440
form to a lump of foam, feelings to bubble, remember that one?

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,640
So for example, one of the stanzas says, be goo-supposed that this river Ganges was carrying

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,240
a great law, a great pimp of foam, and then with good sight, we inspect it, wander it,

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,240
and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, and substantial.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,040
So what substance could there be in a lump of foam?

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,240
So two begoos, whatever kind of form there is, but it past, feature, or present, internal

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,920
or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, the begoo-inspects it, bond

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,320
with it, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow,

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,520
and substantial, for what substance could there be in form?

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Now this is just a translation, I don't know off the top of my head, what the exact

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,520
polyword is, for void, hollow, and substantial.

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Inspec, as well?

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Yeah.

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,520
I can look up the polyword if I can make two.

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,520
So I don't know if it's just a translation, but to me, it makes it sound like that kind

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,320
of, you know, emptiness formed, form is emptiness kind of thing, where out form doesn't actually

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,120
exist, it's just a lump, like a foam, there's no center to it.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,320
Well, no, see that thing, nobody says it doesn't exist, this means it's hollow and void,

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,320
in its existence.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,080
It doesn't mean you denial the actual appearance of the bubble, of the foam.

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,560
So you recognize the nature of that, which is, well, very, very transient, so to speak,

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,120
without any everlasting substance.

31
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,160
And then you recognize the same characteristic in this very form.

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,840
But that doesn't mean that the whole thing does not exist, which is, and that's exactly

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,000
like what you, what you have, what you have just said, the emptiness formed form is emptiness.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,240
Sure, that's true, in a general sense.

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
But now, what would a person mean by that?

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,640
And often they mean the denial, the denial of things.

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,120
I'm curious, I mean, it's not real, it's not there, no, it is there, as empty.

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,280
If there's nothing there, you can't distinguish even emptiness.

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,560
But if nothing is there, there's actually no reference point for full or empty substance

40
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,240
or no substance.

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:18,880
So it is very real, but it's fleeting, it's non-substantial, so to speak.

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,320
But as such, it is real.

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,960
So that's why you recognize that, and then you apply the same to the, to your form,

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,680
to the form that pertains to the sense of self-wide, because sense of self cannot be established

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,840
upon that, which is fleeting, and non-substantial, and invoicing, and hollow, and transient.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,320
So applying that to that upon which your sense of self depends undermines the sense of

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,680
self.

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,720
But leaves the bubbles of the form intact, they were always that.

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,920
What has changed is your attitude in regard to them, appropriation they used to exist upon

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:05,760
the assumption that there is substance in it, there is the actual ground for the self.

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
That has changed, that's gone, and then there's appropriation constant.

52
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,120
And so the same thing applies, and for the rest of the similes, I suppose, the perceptions

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
like an illusion.

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,200
Yeah, for all the other things, yeah, inventions like a plantain.

55
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,720
Yeah, see that whole thing, I thought, it's an illusion.

56
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,920
Yeah, it is, you can regard it, it's an illusion, but again, it doesn't mean that it's

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,880
not real as such.

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,040
No, we're in the city, it doesn't say it does not exist, it's an illusion, and it does

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
not exist.

60
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,840
Yet, when you say illusion, and maybe that's because of all of the other schools of Buddhism

61
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:48,120
or other religious practices, people nowadays, you say illusion, and it's not real, but illusion

62
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
is real.

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,520
If you weren't really, you wouldn't be in that first place.

64
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,680
It's real as such, it's basically illusion, it's different to what you think it is.

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,040
So you're deluded by it.

66
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,840
And when that changes, which you were deluded by in the beginning, it still remains.

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,120
Now, what has changed is your delusion in regard to it, that's gone, but the thing remains.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:24,200
It's like, the essay, Tharmath is such an illusion, and going to that way.

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,240
The last one, which I don't know if I have always thought too far into it, but even this

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,080
one, you know, there are works that go very deep into detail, whether they're right or wrong.

71
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,000
Like, in this magic of the mind, I think, one of his books where he compares consciousness

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,960
to a magician's show, it's saying, suppose a magician or a magician's apprentice would

73
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,000
display a magical illusion at the crossroads, and as bits I would expect it ponder so

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and so on and so forth, and same thing for consciousness now.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,600
Now, do you think this similist would be digging just as saying that, yeah, it's, you know,

76
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,960
not substantiate this consciousness, like you're saying, form, or is there more to be

77
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,760
send from that similist, like, oh, it's like a disceptive, or it's misleading, or something?

78
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:24,560
Well, yeah, you can, yeah, you can say that basically, it's, you have misled yourself with

79
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,320
assumptions in regard to consciousness.

80
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,320
So the magician's performance, if that's the similist, it's really such, it's a magician's

81
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,840
performance, this is what it's done, or your belief upon it, that's on you.

82
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,240
And the most basic deception, the most basic misconception, it's regarding a permanent

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,560
that which is impermanent, regarding pleasurable that which is suffering, and then taking that

84
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:05,840
thing to be yourself, which cannot be, and that's like the fundamental illusion.

85
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,760
So there's, there's no problem in people regarding, oh, this is all illusion, sure, as long

86
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:17,160
as you don't blame things for that illusion, but blame your own attitude towards it.

87
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,840
But usually, whenever I've heard, oh, illusion, illusion, it was said in a dismissive sense,

88
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,160
whereby, oh, this is all illusion, this is all not real, there is no problem, there is

89
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
no nibbana, there is nothing which is already nibbana, which is everything and nothing.

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
It's just to become, having all sorts of views, because you've just blanked the mind of everything.

91
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,120
But sure, illusion is real as such, so stop being deluded by that illusion and see through

92
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
what it is.

93
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,840
And what it is, it's impermanent and suffering, thus it cannot be taken to be yourself, cannot

94
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,800
be taken to belong to you, and that's it, that's all it is.

95
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,020
Bubbles will, and the phone will keep arising for as long as there is a river foaming and

96
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
so on.

97
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,760
But when that river drains up, I, when the aggregate breaks apart, that's it, it's per nibbana

98
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:10,760
and they will not arise again, not even those illusory bubbles and similarly.

99
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:21,600
Another question that I was, you mentioned, an internal external a lot, I was hoping that

100
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:29,200
we could clarify exactly those terms, like I know it's kind of a broad question, but

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,240
if you general, you know, the Buddha on the side said internal external, both internal

102
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,680
external, not even self-ifatana, but I guess the question, I'm trying to figure out

103
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:49,080
is like, internal it to what, what is, what defines internal or its external, and is that

104
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,360
if it's, you know, the first ends of the mind is, so internal is mind, external, not, but

105
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,240
then the question is, is it valid to look at things like that?

106
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:07,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, usually, yeah, there is a degree of mind associated with internal

107
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,280
dimension.

108
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,040
But again, broadly speaking, because it is a broad question, an internal external is sometimes

109
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,400
using not always the same sense, as, as, and I think a Buddha said, basically, internal

110
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,720
would be everything that pertains to you, and an external it would be everything that

111
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,400
doesn't pertain to you.

112
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:37,200
So that's like the broadest, broadest distinction, but obviously fundamentally, like for

113
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,480
an out of hand, for example, there is this conscious body left, and all the name and form

114
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
external.

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,360
So you can see that that would choose to be his, like this conscious body, it doesn't

116
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,720
say, oh, the conscious body is left internally for an out of hand, and name and form external,

117
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,280
it says, what is left is this conscious body, and name and form externally.

118
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,600
So in that sense, when internal means mind, that is gone.

119
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,280
So now that which used to be taken as mind is still there, but it's not internal in that

120
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,880
personal sense, because more often than not, that which pertains to oneself is what

121
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,520
is once, what, what, what he has appropriated, does internal and mind do become almost interchangeable

122
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,400
when it comes to the attitude of people, but they don't need to do it this way.

123
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,000
So when the business is something like kaya, kaya, nipus, tv, i would be like mindful of

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,040
the body in terms of, or in the body, everyone translates it internally, externally, whatever

125
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
you.

126
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,680
You're saying that it's a question of like seeing one's present attitude of taking the

127
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,920
body as mind, me, myself, but being mindful of that otherwise.

128
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,520
But you can, that, that in sati-potanasu basically means you can, if you take it, if you're mindful

129
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,720
of the body internally, you're mindful from the point of view of this conscious body

130
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
here.

131
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,800
You can be mindful of the same body externally, if you approach it from the point of view

132
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:17,000
of nama-rupa, which is external, even if it's looking at your own body.

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,240
So you always have two points of view at the same time, that is the, that is the like

134
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,720
of that, that the fundamentals of every human experience, what, what the experience of

135
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,840
the five aggregates.

136
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,560
And because you have two points of view, there can't be one sent to them, one owner of

137
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
them.

138
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,360
Because they are simultaneously arising independent of each other.

139
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,960
This conscious body, nama-form externally.

140
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,880
So if you're seeing the body in the experience of the nama-form externally, that body is

141
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
externally.

142
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,160
If, if you're attending to the body on the aspect of this conscious body right here, because

143
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,160
of which I have this experience as a whole, that is the internal body.

144
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,160
So here you're saying distinction is like, internal will be like my sense of what my body

145
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,480
is, like the idea of my body, like for example, I'm mindful of my body seated, but not because

146
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm seeing it, because I know that would be, that would be the external.

147
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
That's external too.

148
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
That would be external.

149
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
So the more internal.

150
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,480
Exactly, internal dimension is the dimension whereby if you, obviously, attend it externally,

151
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,960
it's not the internal dimension.

152
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,240
The internal dimension is a conscious body right here, because of which you can doubt what

153
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,920
the internal dimension right here is, it's because the internal dimension is already there.

154
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,240
So, it's not excessive.

155
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,680
Well, it's accessible only through discernment, so to speak, which is why if you discern it,

156
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,640
you can't appropriate it anymore.

157
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,360
You can only appropriate it when you don't know what it is, then it's mine.

158
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,520
Then this very notion of internal is the notion of mine.

159
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,720
When it's discern, when there is no ignorance in regard to it, there is no mine in regard

160
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
to it.

161
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
That's for an art hand.

162
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,000
It's just this conscious body, and name and form, it's turn of it.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,200
I don't get it.

164
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
No, I don't, I don't.

165
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,200
This conscious body is the, it doesn't appear.

166
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Yes, and yes, it sticks to the negative.

167
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
You can say that.

168
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,520
I mean, the appears as a negative, but yeah, if you make the positive, then it becomes

169
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,200
also external, which is not this conscious body.

170
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
That's then it's external.

171
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Yeah.

172
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Yeah.

173
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:49,200
So the external name and form is because of that which external name and form is here.

174
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Because of that.

175
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Say it again.

176
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
External name and form.

177
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Yes.

178
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Because of that, because of which external name and form is here.

179
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Yeah, sure.

180
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
You can say that.

181
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,200
And that's what I mean when I say that in a way, everything is here.

182
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,200
You can say that, and that's what I mean when I say that in a way, everything is external

183
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
to you.

184
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,000
In other words, nothing can be mine.

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,840
So if you want to, if you want to, if you start, if a person suspects in this patient,

186
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,720
then the result will be like what is taking to be internal as mine, and then the opposing

187
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
role external.

188
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,480
Well, those components, so to speak, remain, but what changes is the attitude in regard

189
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
to them.

190
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,760
So really, it becomes more accurate to say there is external, external, and there is the

191
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,400
less external, which used to be internal.

192
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,480
That the internal sense that one's body appears, if it appears, it appears on the level

193
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
of Namah Rupa.

194
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
So because of that.

195
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
And it's such an external.

196
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Yeah.

197
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,920
Obviously, for a protugina, when all that is taken as mine, it takes a Namah Rupa to be

198
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,520
his, and whatever pertains to his body, so it's all a mess, obviously.

199
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,200
But yeah, if it is designated into a phenomenon, positive phenomenon, then it's Namah Rupa,

200
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,000
then it is external as such.

201
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Right.

202
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,440
Because I've understood your statement to somebody in the past where it's like the body that

203
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,160
you can't direct the access, but that by which there is feeling, conscious, or whatever.

204
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Yeah.

205
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,140
You cannot access that directly through feeling, consciousness, perception, because it

206
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,880
receives them structurally.

207
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,920
But you can discern that this body, that you do see externally as a part of Namah Rupa

208
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,760
when it arises as such, is that because of which presence right here and now, this whole

209
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,640
experience is in the first place.

210
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:52,000
And is that presence right here and now, it's what this conscious body is?

211
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,880
So perhaps one could say then that an internal sense of one's body is kind of like consciousness,

212
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
like negative.

213
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,440
It is not, yeah, because this conscious body, it comes in a bundle, right?

214
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,800
You can't separate it one from the other, you can't conceive even university consciousness

215
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,840
apart from the form of the body, nor can you even ponder on the notion of body if there

216
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,120
is no consciousness in regard to it.

217
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,880
So what happens is, with the appropriation, then whatever resembles this conscious body

218
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,200
is just, as it has been piled up on top of that negative phenomenon, and then it becomes

219
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
quite positive.

220
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:35,440
The positive internal of a putuginal, which for him is mine.

221
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,080
So in that sense, internal, perhaps a designation, so a designation, but can't have one of

222
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,160
the gardens, a designation, that's important, would you agree?

223
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Yes, of course.

224
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,840
A designation would never have a problem.

225
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,760
So people think designation is a problem, and they try not saying, I or I am or I will,

226
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,240
because there is no self.

227
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Yeah.

228
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,120
No, the boy, and then was happening to the putuginal, and he said, no, the pilot still uses those

229
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,600
words, those terms, but he knows them as mere designations, and for him, that does not

230
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,360
stand for the actual sense of self.

231
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,200
This question came out yesterday, you were down there, right?

232
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
That was yesterday?

233
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:22,200
And then before, you mentioned thoughts, or your thoughts are external, and that's why

234
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,720
people could potentially read your thoughts if they have that power.

235
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Yeah.

236
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,400
And so that got me thinking like how did that do?

237
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Yeah.

238
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,560
So that means basically that thoughts that are internal, for somebody who has developed

239
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,760
their mind, become just less external than things that are externally external for

240
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
everyone.

241
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,480
So that's what I mean.

242
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,760
Those thoughts don't change from the internal domain where they are, they don't go out

243
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,160
into the external where everybody can see them.

244
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,560
They stay where they are, but what changes is the mind in regard to these domains.

245
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,360
And then you can see other people's thoughts.

246
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,800
They are not aware of it, obviously, because for them, it's gripped by the whole pile-up

247
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,360
of internal mind, they mention, which they just regard, it's hidden, but it's actually

248
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,880
out there, and it can be seen from the way they would speak, act, behave, all of these

249
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,120
thoughts as possibilities become as external to somebody whose mind has been developing

250
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
regard to both the minds.

251
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,120
They're just part of the mind, and I'm a real part of the conscious of it, yeah, yeah,

252
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
of course.

253
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,520
But it seems that the idea of them being internal comes because they're in my brain.

254
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Exactly.

255
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
They're placed in it.

256
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,960
And that's exactly, you look at the phone, the bubble, and there's nothing you can

257
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
place in it.

258
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,560
It has a reason and such, and it will go.

259
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,680
Same goes for every single organ, every single part of your body, that's exactly it.

260
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,880
There has no substance.

261
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,960
Nothing can be placed in it, there is substantial.

262
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,880
So that's why people need to keep wondering on this, to stop associating any notions of

263
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,720
my, as in me, in this brain, in this body, in this consciousness, is in here.

264
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,040
No, these things are inaccessible for any such placements, they're mere bubbles, and

265
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,280
there's nothing to them, but they're still phenomenal.

266
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,240
As such, exactly, yeah.

267
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,800
Which is why people get confused, that's why they can maintain this misconception, because

268
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:40,040
these things keep arise, and the misconception keeps existing, because nobody undoes it.

269
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:47,360
Now the Rupa, in name and form number, that's still external form, because name and form

270
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,840
with time is not that internal sense.

271
00:19:49,840 --> 00:20:04,920
Yeah, it's not that particular Rupa, because of which, there are certain matters, there

272
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,240
is certain matter around the domain of matter, because of which there is the arising of

273
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,880
sites, sounds, smell, add your eyes, your tongue, your ears, when consciousness is there,

274
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,680
that's supposed to be that matter, and that whole relationship, procedurally, you can't

275
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,760
even access it in your thoughts or abstraction, because you need, only through like that negative

276
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:35,560
direction of discernment, which is what discernment is, because you need a form, the eye working

277
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:47,640
and a form, you can't just have one or the other, you mentioned also in previous thoughts,

278
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:57,440
this idea of time-justice being external, with the object, with that form, with the

279
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:06,320
material aspect of the object, not with the actual object, because the object is the result

280
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,520
of consciousness and form, already being there just opposed.

281
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,360
Right, my experience of an object is different from the material of an object.

282
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:21,520
Well you can't say that, because that comparison will apply you somehow accessing the relationship

283
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,560
between consciousness and the object, and then inferring the different, but saying that

284
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,040
it's the same, it's irritable, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, different,

285
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,600
both same and different, not the same or different, makes no sense, because all of those,

286
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,320
either of those would require you accessing that, which you can't.

287
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,400
Thus people maintain notions that this is the same, or this is what the matter is, or

288
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,080
this is different from matter, or this is in the matter, or matter is in it, all of

289
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,640
those things are conceivings, why, because you can't have the second part of that relationship

290
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,360
of which you would need to have access in order to make all of these conceivings.

291
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,840
And that's where they're wrong.

292
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,360
Even if, say, miraculously, they correspond to how things are, that doesn't matter, because

293
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,040
you can't know, you can't access how things are, thus you're conceiving them to be in

294
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,040
a certain way, will always be a misrepresentation.

295
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:21,360
It's interesting to think about the idea of accessibility, in case it's not being accessible,

296
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
not something you...

297
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,560
Not accessible, but there, but there, you know, and you don't exit, you stop trying to

298
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:36,080
concede the access, when a designation there does not move towards it, so to speak, in

299
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,760
any direction, does not try to access it, even by implication.

300
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,520
When the mind is fully developed in regard to it, then it stops being a conceiving of

301
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,840
that, because of which, the mind is there in the first place.

302
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,280
So it's like, taking up what's not accessible, trying to...

303
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:58,920
Yes, that's what conceiving is, taking up, just by leaning too much, or leaning a bit

304
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,440
away from it, or assuming that it's in, out, both in and out, neither in or out, assuming

305
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,640
that it's onward, assuming that it's accessible.

306
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,120
That's why the Mola Pariah is so, that is, and it goes around all of the different

307
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,520
objects, you really come to us, why, because it's not what you are conceiving, it's the

308
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,240
actual attitude of conceiving, that that's the problem, that's the root of the problem.

309
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:32,960
So it's important then to realize that the object being there comes prior to whatever assumptions

310
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
you could make of it.

311
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,200
Well, structurally prior, not temporarily prior.

312
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,640
So it's simultaneously present, but it structurally precedes it.

313
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,280
The structure of movement, the notion of movement is preceded by it, so you can't then

314
00:23:49,280 --> 00:24:17,800
