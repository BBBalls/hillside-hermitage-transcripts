00:00.000 --> 00:20.380
So it's only about the generosity of the day.

00:20.380 --> 00:35.380
So how is generosity hosting?

00:35.380 --> 00:40.380
Why is it good?

00:40.380 --> 00:43.380
Just in general.

00:43.380 --> 00:47.380
What's the point of generosity?

00:47.380 --> 00:51.380
What makes generosity good?

00:51.380 --> 00:55.380
Why is it hosting in itself, basically?

00:55.380 --> 01:04.380
Well, on a most fundamental level, it is hosting because it involves...

01:04.380 --> 01:09.380
It's founded, even if a person is not aware of it, the act of generosity

01:09.380 --> 01:19.380
basically has its core in the act of non-self-centeredness or selfishness or non-selfishness.

01:19.380 --> 01:26.380
When you say, when you use a word selfish, people already have notions about selfish and non-selfish.

01:26.380 --> 01:33.380
And even if you're non-selfish, you're doing it as your sort of decision and choice.

01:33.380 --> 01:41.380
So it's being selfish or not selfish, it's not on that fundamental level that I'm referring to here.

01:41.380 --> 01:48.380
It's kind of secondary to it because people can selfishly engage in acts of not selfishness.

01:48.380 --> 01:52.380
But what I'm talking about is a pure nature of the act of generosity.

01:52.380 --> 01:58.380
If you sort of look at it in its own context,

01:58.380 --> 02:04.380
it is founded upon non-selfishness of a genuine kind.

02:04.380 --> 02:10.380
It doesn't revolve around self-centeredness.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.380
So that's why generosity is good, even for people who are selfish.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.380
Even for people who do it for selfish reasons.

02:16.380 --> 02:22.380
People can be generous for selfish reasons, but still that does not cancel out the act of generosity,

02:22.380 --> 02:24.380
which is the act of non-selfishness.

02:24.380 --> 02:31.380
Sure, on a more general level, their selfishness has taken possession of that non-selfish generosity,

02:31.380 --> 02:33.380
but in itself, it still counts.

02:33.380 --> 02:37.380
Obviously, it's better to not be selfish on any level.

02:37.380 --> 02:42.380
So that's why generosity in itself is good.

02:42.380 --> 02:44.380
That's the sole reason.

02:44.380 --> 02:49.380
Now why is generosity in on selfish? Well, that's just the nature of things.

02:49.380 --> 02:54.380
So generosity in itself, you could then, based on what I said,

02:54.380 --> 02:59.380
you could see that generosity in itself, it's not that fundamental.

02:59.380 --> 03:05.380
Generosity in self is good because it contains the fundamental principle of non-selfishness.

03:05.380 --> 03:11.380
So if you can tap into the fundamental principle of non-selfishness,

03:11.380 --> 03:15.380
you don't have to be generous, because you will neither be generous nor generous.

03:15.380 --> 03:20.380
You'll go beyond selfishness, even if you don't give anything to anyone for the rest of your life.

03:20.380 --> 03:24.380
But it's just people who don't reach those levels of development of their mind,

03:24.380 --> 03:29.380
that kind of freedom, for them it's good to even just emulate selfishness.

03:29.380 --> 03:35.380
Sorry, emulate generosity, which would then emulate, which would then contain acts of non-selfishness.

03:35.380 --> 03:41.380
They are not aware of it, to what extent or whatever, but in itself, it still counts.

03:41.380 --> 03:49.380
It still matters. So basically, one should be actively sort of engaged in generosity,

03:49.380 --> 03:55.380
if he has means and ability to do so and so on, but should not make a practice out of it,

03:55.380 --> 04:00.380
because it's only like a second best, like if you can't really commit to the practice

04:00.380 --> 04:07.380
and really develop your mind directly without any intermediary, which would be the acts of generosity.

04:07.380 --> 04:13.380
Then, yeah, if you can't do those things more directly, then focus on generosity.

04:13.380 --> 04:18.380
Oh, if you're not sure if you're doing those things right or not, keep doing generosity just in case.

04:18.380 --> 04:24.380
Be generous, be helpful, and that's it.

04:24.380 --> 04:29.380
Well, I guess another thing you could add is that, yeah, a person should try and do it selflessly,

04:29.380 --> 04:34.380
but an unlikely person had no choice but being selfish, whatever he'd do,

04:34.380 --> 04:40.380
whatever he does it because he wants to do it, he has a desire to do so, which means he's acting selfishly always.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.380
But then you have selfishness that will then perpetuate and bring more selfishness,

04:44.380 --> 04:47.380
and then you have selfishness that can then bring more generosity.

04:47.380 --> 04:50.380
So you want to cultivate that kind of selfishness.

04:50.380 --> 04:53.380
That's where the Buddha, for example, would encourage people,

04:53.380 --> 04:57.380
actively think about benefits of giving, because you'll be reborn in heaven and so on.

04:57.380 --> 05:02.380
Yeah, want it and do it. Doesn't matter. Yeah, it's not super like 100% pure.

05:02.380 --> 05:08.380
But for where they're at, it's good.
