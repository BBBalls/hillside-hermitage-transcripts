00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
It seems to be, at all, it's a nice practice, it's somewhat easier.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
It's not so confusing, just watching the state of your mind.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
And then just being honest, this is suffering.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
You know, because it's these developments or something.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
This is what it needs to suffer.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
When I follow this development through, where is it going?

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
It's sort of, by seeing the state of your mind, you don't lose the perspective.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Where does this go?

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
When you don't see the state of your mind, why do you go with it?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Even if you know it might end up most likely.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Well, certainly.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
And in pain and displeasure and disappointment or whatever.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
You kind of go ahead with it because you haven't maintained the perspective

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
through seeing that if you're a general state of mind, there was directing you there.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Not that particular thing.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
So, yeah, it is relatively easy.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
If a person is honest.

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
But it's like, you know, different people can find different things easier in terms of practice.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
The point is that it's not, I think, as we spoke yesterday.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
It's not just, well, just watch your mind.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It doesn't really make sense.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Well, it makes sense, but it's just so general that it doesn't really make a difference.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I watch your mind, well, what can you mind?

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
But that's the way we spoke yesterday.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
These are watching the state of your mind, means watching the background of your mind,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
which is what Chita is really.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
It's that peripheral, the general, like mood, cloud, whatever we call it in the past,

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
that kind of just like a general sort of leaning towards certain directions.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
So, yeah, that's how you can see the mind in terms of the five aggregates.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Again, as you spoke, it's the most obvious environment.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
So, like, I might not have any particular sensual design right here, right now in front of me,

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
exciting or disturbing me, but the background of my mind is sort of affected by that.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
There's like a cloud of sensuality, big heavy in the background.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Nothing particular manifested, but it's there kind of directing me.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
And if people are not mindful of that, they'll end up then particularizing

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
that very, like, general cloud of sensuality or ill will, like,

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
data is feeling the bad mood, so they take it out on somebody eventually.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
They're very angry, strained.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
If they're a bit more restrained, they won't take it on anybody else,

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
but they've just been ill will, like, mood internally.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
But it's all coming from the general kind of peripheral sort of background

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
of your particular experience.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
And that's where the mind is. That's where you never...

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
So, just watch your mind, usually people are just looking at what's right in front of them,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
which means they directly don't see what their mind is, because the mind is not there in front,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
the mind is the background of that.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
So, the moods, all of those are kind of a manifestation of that mind.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
But if somebody keeps an eye on the general sort of cloud of one's mind,

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
that ambiguous sort of pressure, that it's sometimes pleasant,

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
something related, sometimes depressed, sometimes, all of those are, like,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
phenomena in the same sense as you have things arising in front of your eyes,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
arising on their own, ceasing, persisting.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
In the same sense, the internal phenomenon of your general mind,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
that ambiguous one, arises in the same manner.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
So, you have a nest for the latest mind.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
It's just that always like that.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And now it's present and it's enduring.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
It's persisting like that.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
And while it's persisting in the state of a relation,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
if you're mindful of it, you won't be taken by that.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
If you don't discern that phenomenon of that mind for what it is,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
you will be taken, then you'll be later.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Like, inexplicably, inexplicably, but you'll be all over the place,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
because you're in a great mood.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Everything is good.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
All the nothing has changed, really.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It was just your mind.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
But because you have no insight or other,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
you have no capacity but to not take it as yours.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
You have to take it as yours, because you don't have anything else.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Then you are related.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Then you're all affected.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Then everybody's in the same sense.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
When they're mind, the acceleration ceases.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And then another state.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Another mind arises, a mind of ill will,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
or a mind of depression, or a mind of something,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
then you're completely taken by that.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
So, basically, you're completely liable to like the swings

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
and the swings of that mind, the wider of your mind.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
As if the rain comes, you will completely drench.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
The sun comes, you're the best in the, you know,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
you're the greatest in the head.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
You have absolutely no shelter from it,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
because you're just taken by it.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
But if you start seeing it,

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
as an equal phenomenon that arises in its own domain of that generality,

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
so it never becomes particular.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
The mood always stays in the background.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
When it's related, you know it is related.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
When it's depressed, you know it is depressed.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
And that's actually enough to not be taken by it.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
There's like the practice of Saty Patan.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
He knows his mind is expanded.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
He knows his mind is drunk.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
He knows his mind is elated.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
He knows his mind is depressed.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
If he's depressed, he knows it is depressed.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
So, it's not, I've been depressed.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
The presence of a depressed mind is there.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
That's it.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Then the presence of a different elated mind is there afterwards.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
So, it's basically, and it's not,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
and also that's another assumption,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
to assume that it's the same mind.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
That it's being depressed.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
Because all you're going to have is a state of your mind.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Your experience will always reveal your mind through a state.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And those states are different.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Which means, those minds are minds.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Prodo.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Not at the same time,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
but basically,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
presence of one mind in that the utmost general level

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
means such and such mind is there.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
And then another presence of a different mind opposite

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
that means such and such mind is there.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
And that's all you can truly know.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
You assume that it's the same mind yet induced those states.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
But when you see that there is no mind being discerned

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
without those states given beforehand,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
you realize,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
oh, the mind is inseparable from those states.

06:36.000 --> 06:45.000
Thus, the mind cannot be on its own independent of them.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
And it's the same sense with the feelings.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
When the Buddha said,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
do you take feelings to be yours?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Like, yes.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
It's like, well, which one do you take then to be yours?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Because there is pleasant feelings.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
There is some pleasant,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
there is neither pleasant,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
there are completely different feelings.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Separate, different feelings.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
So there's no one feeling that then gets kind of

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
turning to the colors of pleasure and colors of this pleasure.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
No, it's a different feeling, entirely different feeling.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
And they don't mix, they don't like connect,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
they don't mold into each other.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
So if you have three different feelings,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
which one is yours then?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
If you have like,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
millions of manifestations of your mind,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
which one is yours?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
None.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
None can be yours.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
But you can see that in general your mind is taken by a longing of yours.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Generally, well, I should say.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Not taken by longing,

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
because that implies your mind sits there.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
But you can see that the mind, which is a general,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
is a longing mind.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It's the depressed mind.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It's the happy mind.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
It's the evil mind.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
It's the economist mind.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
It's this mind.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
It's that mind.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
The mind is there.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And if you see there's dependent,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
or rather as inseparable from the state it has a reason,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
what you see as it coming from over there,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
not from over here, I mean.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
So you are just sort of mindful of it.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
You're just arises, ceases,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
and persists why it changes.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
As any other phenomenon does.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
It shows exactly the same nature.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
But on that general level.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
You have to abandon those things.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
When I say abandon,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
if you know that this longing,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
you have a longing mind.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, you abandon longing.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, see.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
You abandon longing show,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
but you don't abandon longing

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
by interfering with the longing mind,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
because there wasn't yours to begin with.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
So you can abandon you appropriating the longing,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
the mind that longs,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
the mind that's sad,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
the mind that's happy.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You abandon that.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You abandon the appropriation of that.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And that's a very different thing.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
But if you say, oh, yes,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
you abandon the longing mind.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
If you abandon the longing mind,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
it means like, oh,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
you must remove the longing from your mind.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
And that doesn't work.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
It's basically,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
the mind is that longing.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
So removing longing from your mind

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
means you still assume that the mind is separate

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
from that longing,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
and then this longing just infected it,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
and then you clear it out,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
and then the pure mind stays.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
So the pure mind is mind that's left alone.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
The pure mind is the mind.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
It's thinking.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Involved.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Well, you basically discern

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
the impossibility of your involvement

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
in the first place,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
which is how you stop being involved.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
What about seeing your position in regard to the mind?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Your position.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Meaning,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
you see a mind that's the background.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Uh-huh.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And then everything else,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
which is more particularly on that.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
So you see,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
you're not the background.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, it would allow,

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
like a citizen stepping away,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
from the background of the mind.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So yeah, yeah, it could help.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Because usually people by not seeing that,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
they're taken by that background,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
kind of magnetic cloud,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
it sort of directs them

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
towards either real will,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
or sensuality,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
or whatever engines there are,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
or as all,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
through like a latent supermoon,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
happy, happy joyful,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
whatever.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
But it's basically completely dependent

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
on an utterly randomly,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
circumstantially,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
that is a manifested mind.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
So that's how you,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
you can basically be mindful

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
through other daily,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
regardless of where you are,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
what you do,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
well, not completely what you do.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You have to practice restraint, obviously.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
But I mean, like,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
whatever you're doing,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
then it's not clearly unwholesome.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Uh-huh.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Just by keeping that peripheral eye

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
on the general state of your mind

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
for what it is,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
you already, basically,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
you're already fortified against that,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
that like, uh,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
pressure,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
that that mind will exert

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
on you to do particular things.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
So the mind,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
that like a general cloud

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
of like sensual craving,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
if you're not,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
if you're not seeing it,

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
for what it is,

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
as a phenomena,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
it will eventually pressure

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
me to particularizing

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
that very craving,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
through either, you know,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
engaging through any sensuality

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
that you can get at a time

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
wherever you were,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
a big full music entertainment,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
whatever,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
things like that.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
You would end up going towards that,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
because you pushed you there,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
because you haven't been,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
you haven't been fortified

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
in regard to it.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
But for as long as you remind,

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
like, oh,

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
it's still there.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
So like,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
three hours later,

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
or if you're doing whatever,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
you look,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
oh, the sensual mind,

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
it's still there.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
It's enduring.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
And it doesn't matter,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
even if it stays forever,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
it's still incriminating.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
You know,

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
that it will have to cease.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
So you might like,

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
last forever,

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
infinitely.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
So to speak,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
there is no end in sight

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
when you look at it.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
But the fact

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
that it's arising

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
in this manifest means

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
that's why it will cease.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So infinite things

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
are incarnate.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
They will come to an end,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
with their infinity.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
So when the new thing arises,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
the new wonder arises,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
the new infinity arises,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
and then infinity is also

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
impermanent.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
So it's like two completely

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
different domains.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
There's nothing here.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Everything is.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Well,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
these things that arise

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
always arise

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
with the sense of

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
being forever.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
No.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
They arise with infinity.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
They arise because there's no,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
there's no end in sight.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
There's no end in,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
like terms of the possibilities.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
There's no end.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And that's what's mistaken as forever.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
But actually,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
you can have an infinite

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
range of things.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
And then that's taken away.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
And then you don't have

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
an infinite range of things anymore.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
So that's how infinity

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
is impermanent.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
So yes, I think I said

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
that in one way or another,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
if basically if a person

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
were able to discern an infinite

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
from permanent,

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
we'll see.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Well, discern the difference,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
and then you would recognize,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
ah, actually,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
permanent comes from me,

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
the assumption of permanent,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
the assumption of forever.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Infinite,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
it's kind of everything is infinite

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
in that sense,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
because everything arises

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
with infinite amount of possibilities.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Well, it arises,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
but when it ceases,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
it ceases with infinite amount of possibilities.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I mean, new things manifested,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
or other different things manifested,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
also.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
So everything arises in that,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
like infinite structure of possibilities,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
like infinite mind,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
infinite permutations,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
infinite design,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
you can be seeking out

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
and trying to encompass them all anymore.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
And you always have the more,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
and you'll always be more

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
and more and more and more,

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
and more and more,

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
and more and more,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
and more until it ceases.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
So the whole thing,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
the entire domain,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
the entire domain of infinity

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
from the past,

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
all going to the future,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
that's in permanent,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
that's ceases.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
On a particular level,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
yeah, things last forever,

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
in that sense,

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
in that infinite sense,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
until it ceases,

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
on the general level,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
which is where it ceases.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
So that's why it's another mistake

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
to look for impermanence

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
and actual, like,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
in actual cessation of things,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
when you look for them,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and you want to see their destruction,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
and they're like,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
ah, that's in permanent.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
No, that's just another

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
a reason thing

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
with infinite possibility.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
You're just witnessing

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
a phenomenon,

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
and a reason phenomenon

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
of destruction.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And that has a reason.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
So that's why I mean,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
when I say before,

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
or I say often,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
things are not in permanent

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
because you see them cease.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Things are in permanent

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
because they have a reason

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
in the first place.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
So their manifestation

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
means that's why

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
they're not in your control

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
because they are manifested.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
You can't even

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
concede you creating

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
anything,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
you manifesting anything.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Impossible.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
And even when you think

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
of you creating something,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
if you look closely,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
whatever you're

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
kind of working with

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
in your mind in terms of you,

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
that was given before then.

15:43.000 --> 16:12.000
So you always come in second.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
It's so abandoning

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
the filaments of minds,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
whichever the filaments

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
do abandon it

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
or not taking it as yours anymore.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Well, just before you go further,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
the filaments were basically

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
deferred down to the whole range

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
or that like a generally affected

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
the background of your mind.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
It's affected by centrality.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
All the wealth into that particular push

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
that's pushing in a particular direction

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
or finding something like

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
a particular manifestation

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
of that general pressure

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
like vague and big use

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
central craving

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
that you find,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
okay, you sort of centralizing

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
this particular thing

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
or that particular thing.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
So that whole range

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
would be a defilement.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So you can start saying no

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
to these particular things,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
sure, that is the first step.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
But you should do that only

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
so that you can then start discerning

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
the phenomenon of your mind,

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
a reason on its own,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
being affected by such and such

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
and holds some state.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
But if you just go around

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
denying the things you need

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
onto you,

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
fine, but you're

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
carrying the very source

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
of the problem with you,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
you're not addressing it.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
You're not getting involved

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
with that sort of thing.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
So yeah, seeing it

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
for what it is,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
seeing grasping that sign

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
of that phenomenon,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
of that mind,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
as a reason in such and such

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
way means you're not

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
getting involved,

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
because you get involved

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
by not seeing it.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
And that's why

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
that the first,

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I don't know about that,

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
but one, the requisites,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
it's pretty requisite

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
for sort of a party,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
as I mentioned,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
was grasping the sign

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
of your mind,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
chip the limiter,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
grasping that phenomenon

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
of that ambiguous,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
vague cloud of the mind,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
for what it is.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Not only defining it,

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
not okay,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
this is what my mind is.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm not just seeing it

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
for what it is,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
the way it has a reason.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
When you start seeing it,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
like the way it has a reason,

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
on its own,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
and not adding more to it,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
not taking away from it,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
then that phenomenon,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
because it's seen,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
for what it is,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
can't then be understood

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
as not mind.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
But whenever there is

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
a form of involvement,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
then that means appropriation.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
So if you like,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
something to it,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
if you take away from it,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
it means you still assume

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
that you can't add something to it,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
that you can't take away something,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
you're involved.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
So then you're not seeing,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
the clear sign of your mind,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
so then you have to make it clear,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
till you see it for what it is,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
arising,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
ceasing,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
persistent or changing.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Or rather,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
persistent or changing.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Because arising is

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
persistent or changing,

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
ceasing the way it's

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
persistent or changing.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah, just basically seeing

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
the given state of mind

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
as not the rules.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Yeah, and you have to see

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
that it's better,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
like it's better to be honest

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
because you first,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
you get a clearer picture,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
you might see it first time,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
but you're never like,

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
oh, so at once,

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
and it was it,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
no, it keeps seeing it,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
and seeing it,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
for how long?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, it depends,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
how well established

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
the assumption of mind was,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
in regard to that mind.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
For some people it's more,

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
for some people it's less.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
But I think,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
given that it's done half a million

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
years since the Buddha died

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
and the kind of

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
pure dharma,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
this fear,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
it's probably more,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
for most,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
for all the people.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
They need to do

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
much,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
like lots of

19:38.000 --> 19:38.000
undoing,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
for those assumptions

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
to disappear.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
But again,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
that the universal principles

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
of dharma,

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
the path that the Buddha

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
himself only discovered

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
did not create,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
it's always there.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
So even if it's,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
there's no Buddha

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
around,

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
no dharma around,

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
if somebody is repeating

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
these things correctly,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
they would,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
reach the same goal,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
they would,

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
abandon the appropriation,

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
they would see a mind

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
for what it is.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
And then the Buddha

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
did say that,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
he's like,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
I'm, like,

20:06.000 --> 20:06.000
even put to you,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
as even people

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
who don't have the right

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
of you,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
who never heard,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
like,

20:11.000 --> 20:11.000
were not establishing

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
the right display,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
the right display,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
the right display,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
and so on.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Even they

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
could actually experience

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
this passion,

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
this achievement

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
towards this body.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Why? Because,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
what do you see,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
bodies disgusting,

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
who is in,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
getting sick,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
liable to misfortune,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
just anything,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
and then see other people

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
dying and so on.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
If you dwell on the

20:30.000 --> 20:30.000
longing,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
you will experience

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
revulsion and disenchantment,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
and this experience

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
of passion in regard

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
to your body.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
But it's,

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
it's hard,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
and it's almost impossible

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
without the right view

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
and right instruction,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
to experience the same

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
disenchantment

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
towards your own mind.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
But,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
in the same sense,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
basically,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
you can see that,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
you can,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
the fact that you can experience

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
this passion towards the

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
mind is also a phenomenon,

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
in the same sense,

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
your body is a phenomenon

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
towards which you can

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
experience that this passion.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
So you say,

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
it's hard to experience this

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
passion of one,

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
because the mind is much

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
quicker,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
much more ambiguous,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
much more vague,

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
much more fleeting,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
changes quickly,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
moves around,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
so you don't see it.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
And by not seeing it,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
you are appropriating it,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
and you have been

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
appropriating for such a lot of time,

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
that it's almost,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
like,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
well, it feels almost

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
as if impenetrable,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
to,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
to, to,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
like, there is no more choice,

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
mind,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
just taking for granted,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
then the mind is mind.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
The mind is mind.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
And,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
but,

21:27.000 --> 21:27.000
again,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
with the property

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
instruction,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
in terms of the,

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
the dominant practice,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
and you could start discerning,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
even that mind,

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
as a phenomenon.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
No matter how quick it is,

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
generally,

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
it stays the phenomenon

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
of the mind.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
So you don't,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
you're not swayed,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
but with particular movements

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
of the general mind,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
general moves,

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
because they will always

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
remain general.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
And then eventually,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
you can,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
but I don't even

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
passion,

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
enchantment of whatever

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
else with that,

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
as well.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Because,

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
another thing,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
that's an icing season,

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
because this thing will

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
change you.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
You're a man for this.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
What is it, boy?

22:10.000 --> 22:19.000
Huh?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
No.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Sit.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Good.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Good.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Good.

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
It always.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Uh-huh.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
But it always follows this,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
okay.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
See if your mind

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
has,

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
what kind of state

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
you're minding?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Is it default or not?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
If it is,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
bending,

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
that default,

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
that default mind.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Well,

22:54.000 --> 23:03.000
Well, even if it isn't abandoned, even if it's not a defilement, even if it's happiness in good mood, don't take it to be yours.

23:03.000 --> 23:21.000
So basically, seeing the mind regardless of what then mind is, whether it's defiled or not defiled, sure, don't entertain the defilements further when they are present in the general mind, by all means.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
If it's happiness, well, again, be wary of that. You know, there's that, that's what I think.

23:27.000 --> 23:43.000
I think Saliputo, and there was Saliputo said, once you regard pleasure as a, like a painful arrow, dangerous arrow, and then pain has like a deadly.

23:43.000 --> 24:06.000
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure. Pleasure is a dark pain is a dead arrow, something an arrow. So sure, pleasure is not harmful not an awesome, but it's dangerous if you don't see a mind in regard to it, which means, then when another mind comes, you won't see that either.

24:06.000 --> 24:22.000
So you can't like, oh, well, you know, I look at, it's not the bothers me, but I'm not going to look at stuff because it shows the same nature. So you can abandon my bothers you, only by abandoning the nature of the entire thing, and that thing also includes the nature of happy mind, or related mind, or good mind.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
You know, you're not going to be taken, you're not going to get elated by it.

24:25.000 --> 24:34.000
Exactly, so relation is there, great, I don't have to do anything about it, but I certainly can also not get involved with it, not get taken by it.

24:34.000 --> 24:45.000
So to, when he knows his mind is unstained and defiled, then joy arises.

24:45.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah, that's different. Yeah, that's like a type of joy that arises when, not like the joy that comes as a kind of cloud of your mind.

24:57.000 --> 25:15.000
No, there's a state of your mind, but the joy that arises in regard to knowing your mind. In the same sense, again, inside the Buddha said, there is a pleasure arising in regard to not feeling any pleasure or pain for another hand, and that's very pleasant.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Yes, the thing is the joy of the mind is undefiled.

25:19.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah, sure, you should cultivate joy of knowing your mind, which is a joy that doesn't depend on the state of your mind, doesn't depend on your mind full stop.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Yeah, that's what it's, that's what it's so like.

25:31.000 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, I want to joy, I want to defile it, to be replaced by the joy of it.

25:40.000 --> 25:50.000
You can replace it with joy. You can replace both the fun and enjoy joyful mind. You replace that.

25:50.000 --> 26:03.000
Or rather, by abandoning that, you experience joy that doesn't depend neither on the fun, nor on your mind, nor on anything basically that's impermanent, which is why that pleasure is not unwholesome.

26:03.000 --> 26:11.000
And that's like the pleasure of the Janus, similar. It's because it's not unwholesome fun, you have to worry about it, you can even cultivate it.

26:11.000 --> 26:21.000
And it's not unwholesome because it's not underlined by the like late tendencies, though it's craving, though it's this, though.

26:21.000 --> 26:30.000
So it's a different, it's not a joy that it's not happiness that has a reason on a kind of happy mind, because the mind is elated.

26:30.000 --> 26:43.000
It's not the happiness that has a reason, no. It's a happiness that has a reason in regard to knowing what mind, to recognizing the mind, to seeing the phenomenon of that mind, to not being moved but to being stronger than that mind.

26:43.000 --> 26:55.000
So the big, heavy cloud of that mind be good or bad, wants to take you, wants to pressure you, wants to make you go certain way, and you will for as long as that cloud's stronger than you.

26:55.000 --> 27:07.000
But when you become stronger, and then it's like the simulator, teraterigator, you know, it means like a mountain, and no matter what clouds and storms can't, it just does not move, impossible.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
That doesn't mean there are no storms and clouds coming, on the contrary, means it just does move.

27:12.000 --> 27:23.000
And there's another sort of, what I said, for other hand, is not overwhelmed by his mind, he is the one who overwhelms his mind.

27:23.000 --> 27:32.000
And so, you develop in regard to, and you can only start developing in regard to your mind, where you grasp the sign of that mind.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
Oh, this is what the mind is. That's the naming of the mind, and then you start developing in regard to that.

27:39.000 --> 27:48.000
So it's not about the requirements, never arising in game, but it's the assumption that the requirements of mind, or the mind is mind.

27:48.000 --> 27:55.000
Yes, the requirements are the requirements only when they're affecting you, only when you're taking by them, when you took them.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
But there will still be the requirements.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
Things that defile will still arise, but they will not defile you. That's a different thing.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
You still have mud and dirt, but now you're not getting dirty by it.

28:07.000 --> 28:20.000
Before, you would, whenever there's mud, you were muddy. Whenever there's dirt, you were dirty. But now you clean your mind, and you can't get dirty, so that again, similarly, like the Lotus on top of a horrible swam filthy pond.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Not touched by it.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
But also, when the Buddha means mud, mud always comes around.

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah, the mud still kept coming, but the Buddha was just like always seeing. He would always discern.

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
Like, there wouldn't be even a remote possibility that he might not be able to see him. Why? Because he penetrated the whole nature, and that's what an argument is the same.

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
He understood the full nature and abandoned it, so no matter what arises, it can never defile him again.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
That's there are no defilements. But yes, the stone clouds and stuff will keep arising.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
Because it was arising with some to begin with. It's nothing to do with you from the start.

28:58.000 --> 29:13.000
The Buddha said that, actually, when you got to Mahara, he said, well, the reason why Mahara can do with people where he wants, I pushed them in the directions and just make them engage in stuff, is because they take that which is his.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
Like, you go that in his domain, you yourself go in his domain, then you can't complain for him doing what he wants with you.

29:21.000 --> 29:33.000
Well, he said, and what is it that belongs to Mahara that people use? Like, I and Sites, ear and sounds, no, basically everything.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
Your whole sense is everything in and out belongs to Mahara.

29:39.000 --> 29:51.000
Where is the tension in the air? Hey!

29:51.000 --> 30:17.000
Yeah, because there is this, does Angus advise him to put it in? No. Yeah, it's not his, but it's anger. Well, it wouldn't. Like, you can't use the same designation or the same term, anger. If you use it as anger for protrusion, I, a state that he's been defiled by, and it's resulting in anger, you can't use the same for the Buddha.

30:17.000 --> 30:28.000
So, you can say that things that would give rise to anger, still arise for the Buddha, but he's not angry. He doesn't give rise to actually anger.

30:28.000 --> 30:38.000
So, when they're about to try to kill him and stuff, everybody would, anybody would be angry, who would want to go to another, or be upset, or feel a little well, but he didn't.

30:38.000 --> 30:50.000
Nope, and it doesn't mean that he was oblivious to what David Arthur was doing. He was a foolish man. He's an idiot, basically. He's behavior is going to lead to, like, a long, long, lasting harm for him and so on.

30:50.000 --> 31:00.000
But he was an angry or a counter. He couldn't have been. So, those things that defile are still there, because that's Mahara's domain.

31:00.000 --> 31:11.000
And they will remain there, for as long as these senses are in this body, this fire is going to break apart, when you reach his body, and that's then it's done.

31:11.000 --> 31:33.000
So, that is the joy. He knows that he has abandoned the state of longing, and joy is there, and then a rapture, and then his body is calm, and his mind is concentrated.

31:33.000 --> 31:42.000
So, you didn't say he was, he said he's rapturous. You always get the same luck as he later, and you're getting all this excitement.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
Yeah, I think it's a translation.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
I think it's sugar.

31:49.000 --> 31:57.000
Which was a translation with rapture, but I think rapture comes from a Christian concept, rapture.

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
Like, when you're divine, you know, touch it or whatever, and then you have that bodily elation of rapture.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
But it's not.

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
Well, you can see through, like, well, you can get a glimpse of it through discerning the sign of humanity.

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
You can see that it leads to that kind of immobility, equanimity, like, indifference.

32:17.000 --> 32:24.000
Now, the difference tells you of cruel or oblivious or blind. It just means nothing can move you.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
And then that, so, again, you can also see through that, that through discernment of the phenomenon of your mind,

32:30.000 --> 32:37.000
then you start feeling content, and joy, that you are the one overwhelming your mind, not your mind,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
you're wondering, what are your eyes?

32:39.000 --> 32:45.000
No matter how high you are, there's a chopping up your limbs, and brutalizing you in every possible way.

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
You still overwhelm that mind, that mind doesn't overwhelm you.

32:50.000 --> 32:56.000
And that's some, some, like, extreme development, strength, and joy, and a bubble.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
You would, you would, like, well, you would know that.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
And you can see that it leads up to when it comes to, like, through knowing your mind,

33:05.000 --> 33:11.000
you experience that joy, and then that results automatically in a concentration.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
So you don't get concentration through watching your nostrils or something,

33:16.000 --> 33:24.000
and you kind of develop this concentration, and kind of all, no, you get concentration through discernment of right things.

33:24.000 --> 33:32.000
So by all means, yeah, meditate, and then sit, cross-negative, whatever, to discern what your mind, the sign of your mind,

33:32.000 --> 33:38.000
the clouds of your mind, the movement, whatever, see this phenomenon, and then fortify yourself in regard to it,

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
and you'll be concentrated automatically, whether you're going to vid it, where you're going to town,

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
when you sit alone, when you live on top of the hill, your mind is established.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
You know, to step one, abandon, defendants, and okay, now I've done that.

33:51.000 --> 34:02.000
Now come for the next session, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth, a tooth.

34:02.000 --> 34:13.000
Well, it's wishful thinking, if it would only be like that, just here is a set, set a prescribed set of motions, and little methods you do, and you get there.

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
The only set, the only, the only method is, develop understanding of the wrong things.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
And when you do it, it will result in that.

34:22.000 --> 34:34.000
Because abandoning the mind, state of mind, I can say I want to abandon the farmans, but then I won't.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
I want to hold on to the joy, to the happiness.

34:38.000 --> 34:50.000
Yeah, and that's often why people experience fear, because you think, oh, well if I, like sure, I want abandoning pain,

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
but that means I have to give up all these joys and pleasures of the life forever, and the Buddhism.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
But it's true, that's what you do.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
It's true.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
You have to abandon it, and it's you, yeah.

35:01.000 --> 35:09.000
You have to abandon the whole thing, but it doesn't mean that you become joyless, or that means you discover a different type of happiness.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
And that's again what the Buddha said, replace the household happiness.

35:13.000 --> 35:21.000
I, the happiness of sensuality, the happiness of a lay life, replace that with happiness of renunciation.

35:21.000 --> 35:32.000
And see with the pain, replace the pains, the bothers, the troubles of a lay life with pains of renunciation, of an ascetic life.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
It's much more wholesome, it's much more pleasant.

35:36.000 --> 35:44.000
And you know, you can stop and think about it. You know, after being among for a number of years, living relatively secluded, and so on.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah, you know, they're obviously hardships of physical kind, and also to things.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
They enjoy it, whatever.

35:51.000 --> 36:04.000
But nothing is there, is actually comparable to stuff you had to deal with as a lay person, when you were still in the world with your job and stress, and just in the swamp.

36:04.000 --> 36:11.000
The swamp, of emotional issues, and duties, and burdens.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
And that just accumulates.

36:16.000 --> 36:22.000
So whether you're 15, 20, 30 years old, they would just keep growing, but it's there.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
And that's why you have the burden. You will only lay down in the burden.

36:25.000 --> 36:32.000
You lay down in the burden, but obviously that burden extends to all the previous lives, and all the ones that install for you if you don't get out.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
But it is, and you realize, oh, it's actually, yeah.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
Like, I can't tell you how it's much more pleasant here, living with wild tigers and stuff.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
Well, you might die next moment, but it's just clean. Emotionally clean.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
It's not burdening you. It's free. It's freedom, in that sense.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
But that takes time to develop.

36:55.000 --> 37:02.000
The mind is used to the swamp of centrality, distractions, and so on. This seems like death.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
And that's why people will freak out when they will hear the good news.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
But if you were to develop a fortify your mind and become accustomed to it, then you start seeing bad news.

37:12.000 --> 37:20.000
And I was like, oh, no, this is a freedom. But yeah, freedom, for those who are unaware, it's basically death.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
They will be able to hold it.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, because it's nothing else. You only used to be involved with things.

37:29.000 --> 37:35.000
Yeah. Well, yeah, you become essentially dependent upon involvement.

37:35.000 --> 37:42.000
So there is nothing. You just, like, boredom sets in, and then boredom gets replaced by the exact in red.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
So quickly finally something that will keep my mind away from me, from my own state.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Because I'll sink in.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
But if you know the correct path, and even then boredom.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
What the reason for boredom?

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
You go through it and it doesn't rise anyway.

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
Because boredom only rises in regard to, like, a custom levels of distraction.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
And then when they are absent, then you feel bored.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
I, as a kind of like a gentle unpleasant sort of push towards compagnen.

38:13.000 --> 38:20.000
And boredom is that neutral feeling, which is, when unknown, it's unpleasant.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Actually, now there's nothing. There's nothing exciting.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
No, not exciting. It's even.

38:25.000 --> 38:33.000
But because you go used to only the excitement that even is unpleasant now.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
And you go back to the excitement.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
All the depression.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
All the depression for that matter.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
The depression is only the depression in regard to things that you are depressed.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
And that's again, like, when you do know that unpleasant, that neutral feeling,

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
boredom or depression, when you know it, it's not the present anymore.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
When you discern it.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
It's quite peaceful.

38:59.000 --> 39:07.000
But it takes time to develop, to discern that criteria of what peace is.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
Yeah, not scared of it, I don't think it's.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, exactly. It gets scared of it.

39:12.000 --> 39:20.000
Because you became so dependent on the constant movement, constant action, constant something.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Good or bad, just as long as something is happening.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
Because otherwise, I'll just drown.

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
And that's pretty much everyone's life on there.

39:34.000 --> 39:40.000
Because if you think you're in control, well, okay, just decide to stop.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Just decide to stop engaging.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
Stop giving into destruction.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And then you'll see what's going to arise.

39:45.000 --> 39:52.000
And for how long you'll be able to hold it, to hold you determination.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
And the thing is, it's not really optional to do this.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
You might think how well you know.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
It will end in death and destruction and terror and dread.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Start your fear throughout your life.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
That direction of that fear, that's what death is.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
So sooner or later, you will be taken there.

40:12.000 --> 40:18.000
So you might want to prepare yourself, or even if you're able to go through it beforehand.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
So when it arises, it doesn't concern you anymore.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
It doesn't pertain to your being anymore.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Why? Because you extinguish it.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Come, done.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
I just just called die before you die.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
Literally.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
Remove the life, remove power, the being.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
From ever before, it's forcefully taken away.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
Because that means you keep coming back.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
You're dead.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
That's a beautiful place.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Yeah. Well, exactly.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah, death becomes another preparation.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
And you haven't been, you haven't been,

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
when you haven't let go of the appropriation of the fire aggregates fundamentally.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
So you will have to endure their destruction and reappearing and destruction.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
And reappearing and destruction.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Because that's what they do.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Nothing obliges you to stay with them.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
In the same sense, nothing obliges you to stay with the clouds of the mind when they arise.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
But you do, because you don't know any better.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
But when you do know something, like when you don't know better,

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
and you develop better, better than you are.

41:29.000 --> 41:36.000
Then the development,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
and developing your mind,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
developing states of mind.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
What about that?

41:43.000 --> 41:49.000
Well, again, you can use the same designation, but it means a different thing.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
If you want to say accurate, but you're developing in regard to your mind,

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
which is a development of the mind.

41:56.000 --> 42:04.000
Because even if you yourself are not revolving around a general peripheral cloud of ill will,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
that has a reason, let's say,

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
you'll stop entertaining, and in particular notions of ill will,

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
through not engaging in those particular notions of ill will,

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
you wouldn't be fueling that cloud back.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
So it will arise, but it will arise less and less.

42:20.000 --> 42:25.000
And then certain things that might defile might arise, but they will not defile.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
And to know that you cannot be defiled,

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
they cannot possibly linger in any sense of defilement.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
And I was like,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I think, was it an underworld,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
a Buddha or somebody else,

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
was an underworld?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
No, he was an underworld Buddha.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Or maybe not.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Doesn't matter.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Point is, somebody else, I think, was an underworld,

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
and they said,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
oh, I don't.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
You see, always feels the pleasure of his enlightenment all the time.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
And then, and then Buddha said,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
no, no.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
Like, in the beginning when somebody develops to the point of our attitude,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
yeah, there would be that novelty of that time of release.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
But after all, they didn't use it.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
And then, they would feel pleasure, same pleasure of our energy,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
only in certain instances,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
when they would end up in circumstances or something

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
that would, like in the past,

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
give rise to the defilements of anger,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
or sensuality, or something.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
But now, you wouldn't.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
So, like, they would recognize the same set of everything identical,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
but no response internally.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
It's just fully extinguished internally.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
It cannot even be conceived to kind of reappear again,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
and then they feel pleasure again.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
Ah, I am indeed free.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Not that they need a reminder,

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
but when it happens, they'll feel that joy for, like,

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
oh, yeah, I remember when this used to pull me left and right,

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
and control me for, you know, days and end.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
And then, just walk off, continue.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
And so, the problem behind us,

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
is the kindness, it's not the kindness as a different kind of kindness.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
It's a different kind of...

44:25.000 --> 44:31.000
Well, see, once again, once you grasp the sign of your mind,

44:31.000 --> 44:37.000
then you can start attending to what that sign is in different ways.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
But you can't start practicing browning hours of,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
or any other, establishment of mind properly.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
If you don't have the sign of your mind.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
But once you, like, fully established in the,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
in the recognize in the phenomena of your mind,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
you're not even mistaking it anymore.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
You see it.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
Then, yeah, then, okay, why don't you gladden that mind?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
That phenomenon is right in front of you.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Just relax it.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Gladden it.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
Why don't you regard it with loving kindness?

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Why don't you regard it?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
With equality.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Practice immobility in regard to that phenomenon of the mind.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Regardless of what that mind is,

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
whether it's effective or sensuality or happiness or whatever,

45:25.000 --> 45:31.000
you're not concerned anymore with your particular hindrance of that mind.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
You are just looking in the nature of the sign of that mind,

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
which is the development of mind.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
So, you are developing that mind or other in regard to that mind.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Once you have kind of stepped away,

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
this through discernment of that sign of the mind

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
and not being, not being, like, even the jannas

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
or whatever when you establish your mind first,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
you basically depend on the five hindrances.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
You put them away.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Through discernment, and then you get established in that,

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
and then the joy arises from that seclusion and so on and so forth.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
Pramu, Vihara, is there any other type of establishment mind?

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
It was the same, or rather, pertains to the same levels.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
So, your kind is a confused, putugina,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
left and right.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
It doesn't even discern what a phenomenon of that peripheral mind is,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
and then he practices in beings,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
radiating, loving, kindness and stuff.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Let's just wish for thinking.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
They might make you feel better,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
but it doesn't really make any fundamental difference.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Why? Because if you're doing loving kindness correctly,

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
it should be resulting eventually in a pecan,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
in the quantity, in complete,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
or in immobility.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
And you know, you visualizing, loving everyone and stuff,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and going to make a big difference there.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
Why? Because you're not applying it to the right place.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
So, it needs to be applied to that framework,

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
as Nariya mentioned, to the framework of others.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
And that's for the sign of the mind,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
the framework of one's other.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
You are another to yourself, really.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
You're just less external of that than the others.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
But when you start seeing your mind,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
or other minds,

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
a reason on their own,

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
you realize this is like, yeah,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
there is an agreement externally,

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
in that person,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
there is an agreement internally,

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
I, in this person,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
but not of it is mine.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
So, yeah.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Then you apply loving kindness,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
if you can use the word apply.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
Basically, you regard that phenomenon,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
that sign of that mind,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
with loving kindness.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
You are taking control of that independent mind,

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
then arises.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
But you are taking control,

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
like practicing certain attitudes in regard to it.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
You are not taking control by kind of repossessing it,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
by taking, like, by reappropriating it,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
by making in mind, mind again.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
No. Yeah.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
You fully get established in that attitude of this,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
not just that it ain't mine,

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
but it cannot even be mine,

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
because if it were mine,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
it wouldn't have been a rising on its own.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
But if it rises on its own,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
that's absolutely no more doubt

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
that it cannot be mine.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
That's basically the right view.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And when you have absolutely no doubt

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
that it cannot even be yours,

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
even if you want to,

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
and you can't even want to,

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
because that would be a form

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
of taking it out of the yours.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
When you establish it, then yeah.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Regarding loving kindness,

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
or gliding it,

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
or release it,

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
or do this,

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
or do that.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
But that's like the,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
there would be the practice of samadhi.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Establishing your mind in such a way,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
once you've seen it correctly,

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
and once you've got it all ready.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Yeah, that also seems,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
you know, secondary priorities.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Well, it's become natural.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Yeah, it will come.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
Like, the concentration will come as a result of that joy.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
They will come as a result of recognizing the mind

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
for what it is,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
and feeling, well,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
sheltered, feeling safe from it,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
feeling not burdened by it anymore.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Can you feel joyful?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Can you feel joyful?

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
You feel calm.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
You feel calm.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
You feel concentrated.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
And that's what concentration is.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Yeah, it's awesome.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Everything just,

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
we say that,

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
it follows from that,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
or goes from that.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Yeah.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Equanimity.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
That's what it needs to be,

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
it needs to be rooted

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
in the right view,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
in the right discernment.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Why? Because it's a protuginal,

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
and the person here is a concentration.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
They have a protuginal's idea of concentration.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Which means,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
if they then engage in a method

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
and a practice,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
they'll be revolving around their protuginal's idea of concentration.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Which means,

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
there will not be the right concentration.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
And samadhi is such that,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
imaginary color,

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
like every,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
every aspect of the normal day of the party,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
comes with a right view first.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
The right view makes it all right.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
And it's like so self-explanatory,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
that it's actually very hard to see.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Yeah.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
And obviously,

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
because it's not,

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
there is not like middle ground.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Oh yes,

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
I don't see,

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
but I can still do it right now.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
You can't.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
That's a contradiction in terms.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
I'll do everything else.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
I'll learn what it for a practice.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Yeah.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Yeah, I'm not,

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
like I'm not at the right view,

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
but I still know how to meditate.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
That doesn't make sense.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Yeah.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
That's rather nonsense.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
Same there.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Or I'm like,

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
sure,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
if knowing how to meditate means doing

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
one or what,

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
one on the way,

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
but not the,

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
not the meditation,

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
the Buddha within courage.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
So it needs to come with a right view.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
And when there is a right view,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
it will come out of the right view.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
So as you said yourself,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
oh,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
discerning the sign of the mind,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
all the films come,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
all the films come,

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
feeling calm,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
joy is our, joy arises,

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
feeling joy,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
concentration is established.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Concentration is established,

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
we can continue from other cities,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
seeing clearly even more,

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
gets fully developed,

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
like seeing things clearly

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
to the full extent means,

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
means complete destruction

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
of the fetters,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
clearly insight in wisdom,

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
pinealiberate,

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
that's it,

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
done.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
It's not just, you know,

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
just don't bother with trying to understand,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
just stick to a prescribed method,

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
of like physical notions

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
and observations,

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
or the nostrils,

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
and stuff,

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
because it makes you feel better

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
in your pathogen world.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
And then just keep going back to it whenever you need it.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Even while staying pathogen.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
Yeah,

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
even while it's speech.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Look,

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
there is nothing right

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
in the state of pathogen,

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
which is why it's a state of pathogen.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Now, even a bit,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
it might be nice speech.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
It might be lovely speech,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
but it's not necessarily right.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
So that's why the

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
sole concern of somebody,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
who is still a pathogen,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
needs to be developing the right view,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
because then they will make everything as right.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
So I developed a view through this sermon,

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
through this sermon,

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
through this sermon,

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
where you're not well,

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
through this sermon,

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
you can discern things

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
by knowing what you're supposed to discern.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
And you can know what you're supposed to discern

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
by investigating what the options are

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
with this sermon,

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
so to speak.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
That's like what we spoke

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
in the other talk,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
when I was a yesterday or day before.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Like measuring the task,

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
and so on.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
But as you can see,

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
like what we spoke about now,

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
in terms of the

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
chip,

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
the limit and the phenomenon of the mind,

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
and like a general cloud,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
the mood and so on,

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
it's not,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
well, it's not abstract,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
because that

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
that chip that is both

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
your feelings and your perception,

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
which is what the term is the mind.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
So you feel,

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
like that mood,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
you might be able to even describe it

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
in certain terms of perception,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
but you also feel it simultaneously.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Like that pressure of the mood,

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
you can all

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
any mood,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
like even if you can't quite define what it is,

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
one thing you know for sure is,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
whether it's pleasant or unpleasant,

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
fundamentally,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
whether it's kind of okay,

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
or kind of not okay,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
or kind of,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
nah, nah, nah.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
So you start feeling it properly

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
through this sermon in your mind,

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
which is why,

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
for this sermon in the mind,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
results in complete destruction

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
of your feelings,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
of suffering and so on.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
It's not,

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
oh, I need to discern it,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
abstractly together,

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
get my head around it,

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
and then,

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I'll apply it.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Now, getting your head around it,

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
right leg means applying it, right leg.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
That's how you can have, like,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
one liberated through wisdom,

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
through, like,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
just through the sermon,

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
so powerful,

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
the results in complete destruction of fetus.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Here we go.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
You have a mind of your will,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
then, which is unpleasant,

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
it is unpleasant.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
But then,

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
you think by,

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
you want to get away from that,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
unpleasant or pain,

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
and then you want to get to the pleasure,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
so you give in.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Yeah,

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
and that gives you pleasure,

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
the mask,

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
that's fundamental pain.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Same essentiality.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Fundamentally,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
sensuality is unpleasant.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
Remember, I was speaking about this before,

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
like, for some point,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
it was engaged in centrality.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Essential desire arises.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
You just give in.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
You just go for it for satisfaction,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
and it just feels,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
the whole thing just feels pleasant.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Then, you'll find a reason

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
to practice restraint,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
all restraints forced upon you.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
Like, you can't have your desires fulfilled.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
And then, you experience this tremendous pain,

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
like a dart,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
as the sutras refer.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Pacing pain of,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
and you think,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
initially, without any wisdom,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
youth, everybody would think,

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
that that pain is a result of me saying no,

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
to my desires.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
But if you stick to it long enough,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
you start discerning that actually no.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
My restraint, my saying no,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
only made me neutral

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
in regard to the reason thing,

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
and what was revealed then was pain.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
And that's why,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
we give in to the central design,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
because it's so painful, not to.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
When you mind is taken by centrality,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
it's very painful to not give in.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
So you don't even consider it,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
on top of that,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
giving in then,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
not just the mask that initial appears

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
of the centrality of, like, pain,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
it doesn't just mask that,

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
but then it coats it

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
with pleasure on top of it,

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
like satisfaction of age,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
enjoyment of the senses.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
So you kind of have not just avoiding pain,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
but getting pleasure

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
out of avoiding pain.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
It's like a double wedding.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
And that's why it's so hard to break away from it.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
And that's why,

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
like, the minds are so

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
bogged down in it,

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
that even if you were to start practicing your restraint,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
that whole pain in their eyes

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
is you wouldn't be attributing it to centrality,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
because you're so deluded.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
You'd be thinking, no, this is coming from me,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
so you know.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
But basically, you saying yes or no

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
should not make an emotional difference

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
to anything you were about to do

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
or you were doing.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
If it is making difference, means that thing

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
is emotionally evolving.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
And if it's emotionally evolving, means it's not awesome.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
So basically, whatever you were about to do,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
just say no to yourself

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
and see if any emotions are going to rise,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
if they do, means you're involved there

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
and your restraint, you're saying no

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
is just revealing you that.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
It's not adding anything to it.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
No taking away anything from it.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
So that's why, like, that pain of restraint,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
is not actually pain of restraint.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
It's pain of centrality that's revealed

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
through restraint.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
And you see that

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
sufficiently enough,

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
some people sooner or some people later,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
you would not...

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Like, your mind wouldn't go

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
but wouldn't go to the centrality once or ever.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
It could really relish and enjoy the restraint.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
Because restraint is freedom from it.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Mm-hmm.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Yeah, and resulting.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Well, yeah, concentrate.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
And what, resulting in escape

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
from the whole...

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
By not, by...

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Sorry, by by...

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
By attributing the pain to restraint,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
you're always going to have like a romantic

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
pleasurable, delightful notions of centrality.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
And now you're just grinding against

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
through whatever sets of, like, morals

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
and virtues that you adopted externally

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
but not really knowing why.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Because it always feels...

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
And that's what we said.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
He doesn't welcome, he doesn't delight

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
the centrality.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Okay, you have to start practicing those attitudes.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
You don't welcome it, you don't delight in it.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Because even if you practice the restraint,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
if you never ever engage

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
in any bodily act of centrality through any sense,

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
you still can entertain it in your mind

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
for the rest of your life.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
But if you abandon it in the mind,

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
then automatically you won't be able to engage

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
in it by body.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
And there's another similar in the suitors

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
with, like, having a trying to light a fire

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
with two fire sticks, they were in water.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Like, okay, sure, you take them out of the water first.

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
You can't light them while they're still in the river.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
But unless they dry outside of the water,

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
you still wouldn't be able to light a fire.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Okay, I'm out of the water, but they're still wet.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
So, like, one's mind still remains wet,

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
even when the body is withdrawn from centrality.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
The mind still remains wet in regard to it.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
And the mind remains wet

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
for as long as you're misplacing where the real pain comes from.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
By misplacing the real pain,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
you look for the pleasure in the wrong place.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Like, consequently.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
It gets very confusing if you're trying to,

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
you know, attack the mind,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
clear it out with adding this and adding that

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
and fight it with kindness.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Destroy you.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Well, you're just, just throwing more confusion

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
onto the already existing pile of confusion.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Because you've got to make this

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
and make sure, what's happening now?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Yeah, what was it?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Discounting and tasting.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
No, it's this side, just that.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But it all leaves you out.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Just you doing this and you're going to that.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
The dresses you know,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
the very criteria of what made you choose

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
to decide to do this against that in the first place.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Because that's already affected by ignorance.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Yet, you took it for granted,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
that your power of decision is already right

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and knows the way it out.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
So I'll just do this when I do that.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
This makes sense.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Again, if somebody's honest that they know that,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
okay, I don't have a right view.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Thus, even what makes sense to me is not right.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It's necessarily, I do not know.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
So then you really have to stop.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Well, certainly,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
you certainly have to stop

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
using the criteria of what feels right

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and what feels good.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Because it basically is because of the feelings

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
that you are not analyzing.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So using that as a criteria

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
to the enlightenment is a contradiction in terms.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So you need to use discernment.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Literally, start developing the discernment.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
What makes sense?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Use your reason.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Use develop wisdom understanding.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And in big, by big, on top of that,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
you end up with more.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
You build more, and it will progress.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
They will then result

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
in discernment of the fundamental things,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
such as your feelings,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
your intentions, and so on, and they'll feel from it.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I mean, all the way I've talked about it,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
really, when mental is understanding,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
developing understanding.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Same thing is clearly.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
He knows he sees.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:02:06.000
He knows that he knows he sees and he sees.
