00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Is love the path to happiness?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Is love the path to happiness?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Love in your family, love in your dogs, love in you.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
So just nature, a nature of love in general?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Yes, does that mean happiness?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Right.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
The end of the day.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Well, the short answer is absolutely not.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
This is the common phenomenon of love.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
It's inseparable from attachment.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
But if you're not attached to something, you're not loving it.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
So the whole notion of the unconditional love,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
well, it's a contradiction in terms.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
You're either unconditionally bound with it,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
or you're emotionally divorced from it, which means you don't love it,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
which means you're not attached to it.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Because in itself, love is a bond.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Even you can make it as abstract and divine as you want.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
It's still a bond, because it still has its object,

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
which means there is still some sort of attachment to a degree.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
But actually, like, that's as people's fantasies are very often,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
and they talk about their unconditional love.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Like an ideal, an abstract ideal that in practice, love is even worse.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
It's always, in fact, it's always mixed with infatuation,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
with lust, with delight, with conceit, with pride,

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
with everything else.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
That's basically what love is.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Passion.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Passion, of course, inseparable from passion.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
It's where you can kill at the same time.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Full follow.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
You can kill forever.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
Well, I'm sure the people will try to justify the love they would think that.

01:55.000 --> 02:06.000
So trying to be unconditional love for everything.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah, that is just an ideal, basically, that's a contradiction in terms.

02:11.000 --> 02:21.000
Because if you're, well, love, be it even unconditional, is a relationship.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Means you are, you are relating yourself to these things,

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
which means to that extent you're bound by them.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So it's impossible to have unconditional love.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
If it's unconditional, means there is no condition.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
There is no relationship.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But love is a relationship.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
So it's basically saying, like, oh, the unconditional conditioning.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, the unconditionally conditioned, that's what unconditional love would be.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Or have a relationship with no relationship.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
That's just, that's a contradiction in terms.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
So you can find that poetic value in saying contradictory terms.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
But in itself, in practice and phenomenologically speaking,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
makes absolutely no sense.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
So you're either bound or you're free from the bond.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
So it's love, virtuous.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Is it a virtue?

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, it depends, but no, no.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I mean, love can be wholesome.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
That's one sort of slow and answering.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Love can be wholesome in a sense of, it's not necessarily, you know,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
infatuated passion and lust and greed involved with it.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
But as a bond, as something that is fundamentally still rooted

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
in a degree of passion and emotion, it is unwholesome.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
From the point of view of enlightenment, it is unwholesome.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
It's an obstacle, basically.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
It's a bond that you need to break.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Love or hate, basically, if you want to be free from suffering

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
or if you want to develop your mind to the...

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Well, it's full potential, so to speak.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
It's full potential freedom, both must be abandoned equally.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
Both love and hate.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
So love cannot bring happiness.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
It can bring world happiness, which from the ultimate point of view

04:29.000 --> 04:49.000
is not happiness, obviously.
