1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we've established that authenticity, self-honesty is very important.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes sir.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes sir.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But it seems a sense of shame and a fear of wrongdoing.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Perhaps the Buddha also says, you know, the guardians of the world.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Guardians of the world, yeah.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Why?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A sense of shame, fear of wrongdoing and guilt.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is guilt the same?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He can be, yeah, sure.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Because it's...

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, because I think it probably would be on the same level, is it?

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But why is a sense of shame?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a good thing.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, because he prevents you from doing bad.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Doing unwholesome.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Doing things based on sensuality.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Because if you don't have that preventing you,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
there's nothing stopping you.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So that's why it's good to have a sense of shame even if you don't necessarily have wisdom or restraint in place.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
At least that sense of shame will keep you from becoming an animal literally,

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
in terms of your behavior.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So that's why it's the guardian of the world.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
As the Buddha said, if there were no sense of shame,

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the suns would be sleeping with mothers and sisters and fathers with daughters,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and it would just be like animal around the floor.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So there is that, just that, like,

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
even for a completely unenlightened mind, the sense of shame,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
at least is something that would...

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now, obviously, you have the other extreme of, you know,

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
when people become religious and they start turning to this, like, moral commandments and repression,

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but that's not any more that sense of shame.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Like, you know, when you're ashamed of everything,

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
even things that are not shameful.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But it's this kind of natural sense of shame,

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in regard to, you know, like, nudity or body exposure

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
or, like, fluid-caused things in general.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So with that sense of shame, there is at least some kind of rules,

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
so to speak, in the world, on that natural level.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because otherwise, yeah, everybody will just be going with everybody

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and then you will be able to think...

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Could be client, mentally client.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But we have, well, most people, as well as a human being,

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
they have an inherent sense of shame.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, exactly.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You feel when you're doing something wrong.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And yet, we understand.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, if you're honest, if you're authentic and self honest,

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that sense of shame, that's exactly what it becomes,

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
what reveals itself.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I'm not talking about the fabricated,

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
like, oh, it's shameful, but it's really just kind of,

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
more like a hateful attitude that people turn into,

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
like, morally, judgmental and so on.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's more just a kind of real will and repression.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, if you're authentic, then exactly.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There are things that you don't necessarily want to do with others

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or being, like, known.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Which means, then, because you're authentic, you wouldn't be doing it.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're not going to try to conceal it either.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And in the same sense, the guilt for doing something wrong.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, then you realize, instead of denying it, ignoring it,

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and say, oh, you don't hate yourself, and well, no,

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
you're accepting guilt as a result of what you've done carelessly.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then, next time, it will make you think twice,

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
because you're not running away from the disagreeable feeling of the guilt.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're accepting it, and sometimes you can endure for days,

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and then come back again and again and again for years later.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Each time it comes, each time you accept it.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There is a...

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's thought-free.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's good to be guilt-free.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No shit.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, that's true.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's good to be guilt-free, and the only way to be guilt-free

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
is through full accepting guilt, and then going beyond it.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Not by ignoring it or denying it.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And that is exactly the case.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You feel that inherent sense of shame,

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
but they project it and blame society for it.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, yes, society has a lot of blame, the degree of shaming,

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
but there is that threshold, which is the natural shame,

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and some people, yeah, we have more of it, some people have less of it.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Certain things that will just make you uncomfortable.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But then people find that a problem, because, yeah,

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
it can be unpleasant, obviously, if it's preventing you from doing what you want to do,

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and then, yeah, you do blame society, blame the culture,

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you rebel against it, you go completely...

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You try to override it.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But that's completely misplaced effort.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The better effort is actually no.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There is a place for that natural degree of sense of shame

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in regard to doing things that are really...

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Not...

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Not nice.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, they are inappropriate.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because of that, and the fear of wrongdoing,

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that's why it's always bound together.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, I don't want to do it. It's just a problem.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like stealing, lying...

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Stealing, lying cheating.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Just being basically acting like a...

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Just following your desires in the same manner and animalhood,

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
without any reflection or...

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know, you see dogs, I mean, they get into...

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They get you into a village,

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and they know they're most likely going to be attacked

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and maybe seriously injured by all the other packed dogs.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But they just...

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
They just saw either a female and lost perspective or food and lost perspective.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And you know how...

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
They know how it's going to end,

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
but they just have no reflection over it to consider it.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So they just go and eat, and while they eat,

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
then they get attacked, and that's it.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And then they...

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They don't know the consequences.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, they don't know about this consequences.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They can't factor them in,

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
because the mind doesn't possess the same powers of reflection as human mind does.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And that's why they don't have the sense of shame.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's why, you know, you have a puppy and a mother,

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and it's all like, oh, that's my mother.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But once he passes it on age,

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and he starts responding to female hormones and the less insecurity,

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
then he just starts seeing the mother as a female.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's not any more seen as a mother,

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
for as long as the heat is going on and so on.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There's no sense of shame.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They don't perceive that.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But for most people, they do have that recognition,

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and that sense of shame will be guarding,

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
going that way.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
For most, it's not always people at difference

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
or people don't have any natural sense of shame.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And how do you develop the sense of shame?

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, but become self-transparent.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And by keeping your desires in check,

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
then you realize that with or without the sense of shame,

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you are the one responsible for saying yes to desires

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and following them through.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Because it doesn't matter what thoughts your mind

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
might be presenting in forms of desire,

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
possibilities for things you want to do.

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That doesn't matter.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What matters is you're accepting to do it or not,

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and then following through and doing it.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Or not.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So that's self-honesty.

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Self-honesty.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You don't blame the society.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You don't blame government.

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You don't blame your genes.

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Or that's how I was born.

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because even if all those things are in play,

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
you, in the present moment,

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
is always responsible.

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I always respond to the society.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The reflection of that.

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The consequences.

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The reflection of the consequences.

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, that can help, but not necessarily.

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's like saying, you know,

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
people try to give up some addiction.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They can reflect on consequences,

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but when the addiction present,

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
they don't see consequences relevant

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
on the same level as what the addiction is.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But if you're self-honesty,

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you realize you would be able to allow

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
whatever pressing desire arises.

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You would be allowed to arise

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and having now space to not give it in.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Or be kind of occupied.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But that takes that you have to start seeing benefit

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
even in that initially strength.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If you don't, then there is no,

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
there won't be enough.

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, there won't be enough ground for any property.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because without that restrained beforehand,

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you won't be able to allow desire

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
to come close without you acting upon it.

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
As soon as that coming, you'll be acting upon it.

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But the restrained will prevent it.

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It doesn't mean it's going to make things,

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
well, it will make things nicer and easier

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and more peaceful later on.

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The mind grows out of it.

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, it grows from it.

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But until then, it's actually yet

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
it's going to reveal the pain on the lying pain

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:50,000
beneath the desire and the lack of restraint.
