WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.400
There's loads of questions anyway, but I'll start with this Anapanasan Suta, 118, when it says

00:16.400 --> 00:25.680
the fulfillment of the four foundations of mindfulness, when you do breathing, it says

00:25.680 --> 00:33.300
you're on that occasion, the big fibides contemplating the body as a body, I didn't fully

00:33.300 --> 00:39.440
aware of my thought, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. I said that this is

00:39.440 --> 00:54.080
a certain body among the bodies, namely in our breathing. So I say that is a certain

00:54.080 --> 01:04.000
body among the bodies. Yeah there's quite a quite a bit of a debate over that translation.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.800
I don't know if I'm a big body and then I think the other one I thought he was referring

01:10.800 --> 01:17.280
to it as a body in and out breath and another say well no it refers to the whole body, so

01:17.280 --> 01:28.160
the whole body breathing, so it was never clear just looking at the body, but in terms of

01:28.160 --> 01:36.480
the practice of the mindfulness of breathing, I think maybe I didn't, but I think I mentioned

01:36.480 --> 01:48.800
that in the notation, maybe you don't get that, you didn't have that part. Well the mindfulness,

01:48.800 --> 01:55.520
yeah the mindfulness of the in and out breath in and out breathing is inseparable from the body,

01:55.520 --> 02:03.120
it is bodily, it's bound with the body, so one doesn't occur with the other, you cannot possibly

02:03.120 --> 02:09.520
conceive in and out breath of breathing without conceiving the body, and same body means breathing.

02:13.680 --> 02:19.520
When you're mindful of in and out breath then that which is the body there at that time

02:20.400 --> 02:28.640
is one among the ways of experiencing the body. Body among all the possibilities you can

02:28.640 --> 02:36.880
experience your body, familiar out familiar, far near, heavier lights, whatever, this is one of them.

02:40.800 --> 02:46.560
Well the body of, the way the body is experienced while breathing, while being mindful of breathing,

02:46.560 --> 02:47.840
not just like while breathing.

02:47.840 --> 02:58.800
I don't have time to refine my vision of the body.

03:00.240 --> 03:06.880
Well yeah that's because you're expecting to find something hidden there, so you need to like

03:06.880 --> 03:14.080
sharpen your binoculars to really see the details. That is true only to a certain extent,

03:14.080 --> 03:21.280
it doesn't really work like that. Like sharpening the image means like clearing the vision,

03:21.280 --> 03:28.400
as you say it means just finding more details about it, but you can find as many details as you like,

03:28.400 --> 03:34.800
if you have no sight of the nature of that thing, which is on a general level, no details will help you.

03:34.800 --> 03:45.520
So again, what do you expect, what do you hope, what do you crave for, you find,

03:46.800 --> 03:50.480
when you look at the body, when you want to look at it even closer, why, why, what's that?

03:50.480 --> 04:02.560
I don't know what I expect, if I say yeah, I want it okay, I'm going to look mindful of the body now. Why?

04:04.960 --> 04:06.320
Why?

04:10.880 --> 04:13.680
Well to become dispassionate towards it. Why?

04:13.680 --> 04:20.880
Why? To be passionate towards it. No, why? Why? Why is that a goal?

04:24.880 --> 04:28.080
Why is dispassion good?

04:32.880 --> 04:41.120
Wow, is that obvious? No, say it, it's obvious, say it. Well it would be to be free from that passion

04:41.120 --> 04:47.360
or what, depression, covetousness and grief of the world. So what are those covetousness, grief in

04:47.360 --> 04:53.520
the world and everything having common? No suffering, suffering here. So the whole point is to be

04:53.520 --> 05:00.800
free from suffering, but if you're attempts to look at the body closer and closer and closer,

05:00.800 --> 05:07.120
are frustrating when making your suffer, then you are contradicting the whole purpose.

05:07.120 --> 05:13.600
So yes, we agree, mindfulness of the body will bring freedom from suffering, but you have to find

05:13.600 --> 05:21.280
out how, not just do it blindly. And yes, we agree, not being mindful and not keeping the

05:21.280 --> 05:29.200
preset who certainly result in pain and suffering, and just obvious. But when it comes to,

05:29.920 --> 05:34.320
because you are doing the suffering, the suffering is not hidden behind some,

05:34.320 --> 05:42.880
some distant, I don't know, stones that you have to all turn up and look underneath and find

05:42.880 --> 05:48.480
what's there. You are doing it. So once you place yourself in certain amount of

05:51.120 --> 05:56.640
containment through precincts and kind of okay, our practice and making the effort,

05:57.440 --> 06:03.600
well now within that you actually have to sometimes turn around and look at what you're doing

06:03.600 --> 06:08.960
within that, not just keep going and looking out to find the cause of the suffering,

06:11.520 --> 06:17.520
because craving is done, you're responsible for it, and craving is the absolutely only direct,

06:17.520 --> 06:23.280
well it's the direct and absolutely only cause for duka. Craving means presence of duka,

06:23.280 --> 06:29.280
absence of craving is absence of duka, simultaneously, no time lapse in between,

06:29.280 --> 06:35.040
it's simultaneously rising, simultaneously ceasing. So whenever there is suffering in regard to

06:35.040 --> 06:42.160
absolutely anything, even if it's your meditation, means craving is there. So initially,

06:42.800 --> 06:48.720
certain amount of suffering is inevitable. When you put that container, the craving is still there,

06:48.720 --> 06:53.200
so you will suffer. But if you just keep taking that for granted, you'll never recognize the

06:53.200 --> 06:56.800
phone over truth. So after a while within that container, you have to start saying okay,

06:56.800 --> 07:03.840
this is nothing, I'm not doing anything on the whole soon, so why am I still suffering within that?

07:06.880 --> 07:12.560
When you recognize that the craving is that dark, the direct clean is generating suffering,

07:12.560 --> 07:20.240
you stop doing it, and then you'll know how to meditate and everything else. And by the way,

07:20.240 --> 07:28.000
Anapanasad is taught to at least so to punish. So as many as you shouldn't be trying it,

07:28.000 --> 07:33.840
because through trying that, you can come to understand these things I'm talking about, but

07:35.040 --> 07:40.320
you have to know that what is the, well you have to keep a goal in mind, because it's so easy

07:40.320 --> 07:44.640
to become, when it comes to meditation, everything, and obviously, because all of the

07:44.640 --> 07:50.640
contemporary interpretations and techniques and stages and attachments or whatever else they talk

07:50.640 --> 07:57.920
about, you kind of are always led to expect something, even you can sit, you expect something,

07:57.920 --> 08:03.200
I expect peace from meditation, I expect this, I expect that. And expecting something,

08:03.840 --> 08:08.800
it's like waiting for something, doing it in order for something to arise, and that's exactly

08:08.800 --> 08:14.080
the type of wrong meditation that would have condemned. In that sort of way, he said, you're like

08:15.280 --> 08:20.640
among primeditists or meditists, under meditists, mismetitists, just as a aina,

08:21.280 --> 08:27.760
like waiting in front of a rabbit hole or as a stalk, like waiting for the fish, just waiting,

08:27.760 --> 08:35.280
waiting, like focusing just on one point, looking for other animals of prey, in the same sense,

08:35.280 --> 08:41.440
among sits and like waiting for something to happen to his mind. And that's, that's basically

08:41.440 --> 08:49.040
meditation today, that's what it's called as meditation, all of this arises, and even if it's not

08:49.600 --> 08:56.960
explicitly defined, you will inevitably imply that that expectation, that expectation will be

08:56.960 --> 09:02.800
implied in whatever meditation you do, or whatever meditation technique, whatever. One thing they all

09:02.800 --> 09:06.560
have in common is none of them will teach you in the standing, because there isn't any,

09:07.280 --> 09:12.400
the teacher technique, you'll teach a type of prime, prime, prime, no,

09:13.120 --> 09:17.920
prime, type of praying upon something. Yeah, you pray upon something.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.400
So that's what it comes down to, yeah, whether it's this we pass on that, you're just praying

09:24.400 --> 09:28.960
upon time, then you have this old woman feelings or whatever, oh yeah, you've got it in the

09:28.960 --> 09:33.760
rows or whatever, but that's all just like, you know, you tickle your foot, it will start to

09:33.760 --> 09:39.840
itch. You do this if you result in that, it's absolutely means nothing in terms of understanding,

09:39.840 --> 09:44.960
it's irrelevant. But once you have the understanding, even if you do meditation, you'll be doing

09:44.960 --> 09:49.920
it rightly, whichever meditation you do, because you'll be doing it through the right view,

09:50.720 --> 09:55.760
I, in from the perspective of craving, and not craving, and I'll generate more craving,

09:55.760 --> 10:03.600
and I'll be dependent upon craving expectations. In other words, you'll be standing yourself in

10:03.600 --> 10:09.760
further, in the path of non-suffering that you ordered and disturbed. Because you know that it's

10:09.760 --> 10:13.920
suffering. Because you know how suffering rises, you know how suffering ceases, so whatever you do,

10:13.920 --> 10:31.520
you'll be doing it for a cessation that's suffering. Because when I was saved by a focus on

10:31.520 --> 10:45.600
that birth elements and seeing the earth element, just, it's just the earth element. There's nothing

10:45.600 --> 10:52.160
more that can be expected from it. It's quite, you know, in my experience, like, I say, I

10:52.160 --> 11:01.200
established mine in there. It's not, I feel like, this is just the earth element and establishing mine

11:01.200 --> 11:08.160
in that place. There's nothing more that I can expect. One thing that you can't develop then,

11:08.160 --> 11:14.560
but that thing does not, it's not, cannot be done through craving. So yeah, there won't be

11:14.560 --> 11:22.240
an expectation. There won't be any craving when you establish your mine in there, or never. But what

11:22.240 --> 11:31.440
you can do then is keep developing, practicing mindfulness in regard to the established mine upon

11:31.440 --> 11:36.320
earth. You know what? I mean, like, hold it in your mind for as long as you can as they do in

11:36.320 --> 11:44.080
those repassionate centers or whatever else. But be aware of its persisting or changing of the

11:44.080 --> 11:50.320
reason thing, which is establishment upon earth. Oh, yeah, there's nothing to expect here. The

11:50.320 --> 11:56.320
thing is still present. And it's still present. And it's still present. And it's still present.

11:56.320 --> 12:02.800
Not equally present. Other things start arising, but don't lose the sight of that establishment

12:02.800 --> 12:08.080
which starts to act as a reference point. It's there while other things are arising. So then

12:08.080 --> 12:13.600
you're really experiencing things through that foundation, foundation of mindfulness, which is

12:13.600 --> 12:19.200
why they're called foundations or references or whatever else you translate it. And then you will

12:19.200 --> 12:23.760
see that whatever that thing upon which you establish will eventually come to fade. And then you

12:23.760 --> 12:31.360
are aware that you know you see arising and ceasing. It's arising and its cessation. As I said

12:31.360 --> 12:38.640
before, arising is like ascension. Sessation is like descent. So it's through arising,

12:38.640 --> 12:43.280
persisting or changing is manifestant. Through ceasing, persisting or changing is manifestant.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.040
That's why three characteristics. But they're not linear characteristics as they are translated

12:47.040 --> 12:53.600
or usually written down. So it's arising while persisting while persisting and changing.

12:53.600 --> 13:01.360
And it's ceasing while persisting and changing. Fading in, fading out. The identity of the same thing

13:01.360 --> 13:08.000
remains. But in a way it's not the same thing because it's intensity varies, varies, changes.

13:08.880 --> 13:14.400
And then another thing has a reason. But the thing is with the establishment upon such a general

13:14.400 --> 13:20.400
phenomenon such as earth or any other casino, you can just maintain that mindfulness throughout

13:20.400 --> 13:26.080
in regard to anything because anything that arises on the particular earth has the element of earth

13:26.080 --> 13:32.720
in it. And the sublime, the most supreme of them all, consider consciousness. Imagine that. Anything

13:32.720 --> 13:38.720
that arises implies presence. Anything, no matter how subtle, how quick, how slow, you establish

13:38.720 --> 13:45.440
upon the phenomenon of presence of anything. You mindfulness cannot lapse because it's actually

13:45.440 --> 13:54.080
maintained through the particular arising of various irrelevant things. Is that establishing

13:54.080 --> 13:58.960
a mind on infinite consciousness without being the same thing? Because then it does seem

13:58.960 --> 14:06.400
but easy, easier. Because if you establish a mind of presence. Oh yeah, well yeah, well, I don't

14:06.400 --> 14:11.440
mean presence in a tree hugging, new age. I mean presence, phenomenological presence.

14:11.440 --> 14:16.320
It's a present of a thing. Whatever it's in front of you, I think that it is present.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.640
So within that, it's in front of you. You can be even more mindful and more established

14:20.640 --> 14:25.040
upon something more general. So you can get yourself upon the earth. So the element of earth

14:25.040 --> 14:29.920
is present through other things. It's quite supreme in regard to everything. But then there is more

14:30.480 --> 14:37.200
supreme in regard to the element of earth. And fun, unoptimately, it's the consciousness.

14:37.200 --> 14:42.320
It's the most supreme, the most refined thing. But you don't have to go that far. Because it's

14:42.320 --> 14:48.080
that reference point that matters. Because that's what gets to me in a way. As well, I suppose

14:48.080 --> 14:55.760
it's my craving, because I try to establish my own earth and then there's also water.

14:56.640 --> 15:01.520
And there's also fire. How about some air? How about some diversity?

15:01.520 --> 15:07.200
Well, that's the thing when that starts happening. It means you are not really established

15:07.200 --> 15:11.600
upon the element of earth because you lost it so quickly. But if you were established,

15:11.600 --> 15:15.760
if your mindfulness was setting it, then when those other cravings start coming up,

15:15.760 --> 15:18.240
you see them through this reference point, which you won't lose.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.880
And then if you start feeling, oh, what if I start losing this reference point,

15:22.880 --> 15:27.280
you see that through the reference point of earth. Because it is within that already.

15:27.280 --> 15:32.560
And that's how understanding comes. Through practicing that while, remember I was

15:32.560 --> 15:38.800
emphasis in that before. That's a practice of mindfulness. While two things simultaneously present,

15:38.800 --> 15:44.240
you become aware of that principle. So if you do that long enough, you realize that

15:44.240 --> 15:48.640
the understanding will come. Even if you don't go around experiencing every individual thing that

15:48.640 --> 15:54.960
can arise while you're established upon the element of earth, you do that to a certain extent.

15:54.960 --> 15:59.440
But after a while, it becomes apparent. You understand, you see through it, and you realize that

15:59.440 --> 16:05.520
whatever has a reason, whatever will arise, whatever is rising now, will remain

16:06.480 --> 16:12.160
inferior to the element of earth upon which I'm established. So that's how that understanding

16:12.160 --> 16:18.480
kind of compensates, deals with it, fills up whatever else experience you were lacking in terms of

16:19.840 --> 16:24.000
in terms of insight. But sometimes you need to go through these motions more before the

16:24.000 --> 16:29.520
understanding occurs. But full, full, eventually it should occur. And when it does, then you will

16:29.520 --> 16:33.120
stop chasing particular things and stop being concerned about them. Because you understood,

16:33.760 --> 16:36.400
whatever comes in, whatever goes out has to come to you at this point.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.200
And that's what matters. It doesn't matter if the particular thing never matters.

16:42.960 --> 16:48.080
It was that relationship that you were not aware of. It hasn't been understood,

16:48.080 --> 16:52.640
which was inducing all sorts of emotions and cravings and feelings and confusions and five

16:52.640 --> 17:04.400
engines. Yeah, I'll experience breathing, experiencing rapture. I say that this is a certain feeling

17:04.400 --> 17:12.080
among feelings, namely giving close attention to giving it out of breathing, a certain feeling amongst

17:12.080 --> 17:18.880
feelings. Well, given close attention, I'm like we have to really look into a pile in there.

17:18.880 --> 17:26.640
See the translation, but anyway, I can still answer it. The whole point, the whole point, say,

17:27.360 --> 17:32.400
say you understood the craving, you saw the phone over the truth. So you are at least a

17:32.400 --> 17:40.560
soda partner. You practice mindfulness of breathing. So breathing is bodily.

17:40.560 --> 18:01.600
It's intentional act that belongs to the body. So with the lack, with the lack of mindfulness

18:01.600 --> 18:12.000
and with the lack of knowledge, that bodily act is appropriated, either through I am reading

18:13.760 --> 18:20.480
forcefully or voluntarily or through complete ignorance of that breathing whereby you think

18:20.480 --> 18:24.000
it's completely automatic. So you obscure the fact that it is intentional.

18:24.000 --> 18:35.200
But if you don't do either, you can actually come to see that breathing is an intentional act

18:35.200 --> 18:44.240
being done right here that doesn't belong to you. And there isn't anything more you can ask for

18:44.240 --> 18:51.600
in terms of meditation, object in the letter comments. You have an act being done right here,

18:51.600 --> 18:58.000
right now, intentional act, not involuntary like a heartbeat or something like that.

18:59.120 --> 19:05.200
Yet it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the body. You become established in that, then

19:06.400 --> 19:11.440
that body there will be one among the bodies which you are experiencing. But it will be the body that

19:11.440 --> 19:17.600
matters, it will be the body that is not yours. That feeling there, looking at that type of

19:17.600 --> 19:22.480
intentional breathing that doesn't belong to you, that feeling you have there at that time in

19:22.480 --> 19:26.800
regard to that will be one among feelings that you can experience, but it will be the one that

19:26.800 --> 19:32.400
matters because it will be feeling that it is not yours. That intention there and goes

19:32.400 --> 19:39.120
same for what we have against. So that's why it will have to be done properly with the right

19:39.120 --> 19:46.320
view, it will have to culminate in the full development of the enlightenment factors, the four

19:46.320 --> 19:53.040
powers and then the enlightenment factors. Because it will just reveal the whole thing as it is.

19:55.920 --> 20:00.160
But it has to come through that, that's why you said I am breathing in like this,

20:00.160 --> 20:07.280
like as if you're doing it, you start doing it just to become a parent it, yes you are doing it

20:07.280 --> 20:17.200
and that whole thing is not yours, it's bodily. So everything remains the same so to speak,

20:17.200 --> 20:25.200
just the emphasis of I am breathing, bodily intention shifts onto the body. So I am breathing

20:25.920 --> 20:32.400
bodily intention, but now it's resting on the body. So even that I am breathing ceases to be yours,

20:32.400 --> 20:39.680
ceases to be mine, ceases to be me. And then you become really established, then you come

20:39.680 --> 20:43.360
breathing in like this, I am breathing in like that, I will be breathing in like this, I will be

20:43.360 --> 20:46.960
breathing like that, I will be feeling this, I will be feeling that I will be doing this, I will be

20:46.960 --> 20:52.000
doing whatever you like because none of it belongs to you. And by practicing it like that,

20:52.000 --> 21:08.240
you're just kind of reinforcing that recognition, that it's not yours, because it's just

21:08.240 --> 21:16.160
inferior to the whole body. Well yeah, none of it would be there if that body is not there,

21:16.160 --> 21:23.680
if that body is not intentional to begin with, if there is no intentionality belonging to the body

21:23.680 --> 21:31.120
in regard to the body, none of this will be visible, but it's just that you appropriate intentionality

21:31.920 --> 21:37.520
because that's mental belongs to the mind and the Buddha said it's much harder, well it's easier

21:37.520 --> 21:43.520
to see body as not yours and get this passion in regards to it and so on in regard to it,

21:43.520 --> 21:49.840
but it's much harder to feel the same towards your mind because it's half-ler, faster, harder to

21:49.840 --> 21:57.520
recognize and so on, but mind is inconceivable without the body, there is no consciousness

21:57.520 --> 22:03.920
just opposed to over the body, if it's not paired with it, there wouldn't be number up or

22:03.920 --> 22:11.680
the other number up, it just wouldn't exist. So that's why this whole, the elements in body contemplation,

22:11.680 --> 22:19.120
just to reveal the subordinate position of the greatest of your thoughts and mind and

22:19.840 --> 22:28.400
yeah, the mind comes first in terms of determining things, but the order of form being first structurally

22:28.400 --> 22:35.920
cannot ever change, so as an act, for an action, the mind determines it, but structurally speaking,

22:35.920 --> 22:43.920
it's all dependent upon this conscious body, matter that is paired with consciousness out there,

22:48.880 --> 22:49.600
conscious matter,

22:49.600 --> 22:59.200
is now when you think consciousness you kind of imply it inside of this end of this spectrum

22:59.200 --> 23:03.360
and the matter is out there in the world, actually both consciousness and the matter around

23:03.360 --> 23:07.360
there in the world, your consciousness is there with your think, that's why you can even,

23:08.320 --> 23:15.120
well that's where you can perceive distances and space, but oh that's why you can think

23:15.120 --> 23:20.880
in terms of space and in terms of distances, because consciousness is already there and it goes

23:20.880 --> 23:24.640
into infinity, that's where you can perceive into infinity, if you're able to reach it.

23:28.800 --> 23:35.200
The idea, just the thought of space will be inconceivable, if consciousness is generally inside of you

23:36.080 --> 23:40.800
or in your head, as opposed to the matter out there, it will be just a perfect linear

23:40.800 --> 23:48.400
flat, but it's not, is it one, would you say that it's one presence,

23:48.400 --> 23:52.720
no, it's many different, as many forms as many consciousness, that's the thing,

23:53.600 --> 24:00.080
if it's one then it's mine, if there's six, which one's yours then, and there are six,

24:00.080 --> 24:07.680
each domain of the senses has its own consciousness, does each particular, within that you have each

24:07.680 --> 24:12.560
particular consciousness within the same nature of consciousness, that's all those divisions like

24:13.440 --> 24:18.880
618, 108 of feelings of this, that's how it goes, it's not linear, it's not like commenter is

24:18.880 --> 24:26.000
trying to list them all up, yeah, so yes there is, as an aggregate, as a nature of consciousness,

24:26.000 --> 24:31.360
there is consciousness, but in terms of experience there's six domains of your senses,

24:31.360 --> 24:38.320
that's six consciousness, six different consciousness, just recognizing that can be enough for

24:38.320 --> 24:44.240
this passion and abandon the right view, because if there's six simultaneously present the conscious

24:44.240 --> 24:50.320
domains, well none of them, well certainly not all of them can be mine, and if there is no

24:50.320 --> 24:57.440
feeling of singularity, like one, me, there is no feeling of self, and master it, because if there's

24:57.440 --> 25:04.080
six, well which one is it then, oh is this one, yeah, but now is the other one, so

25:05.120 --> 25:08.800
the one that you thought it was yours couldn't be yours, because now the other one is in its place,

25:09.600 --> 25:15.120
so there's six, and then within each of those domains of consciousness you have infinite,

25:15.120 --> 25:26.320
infinite structure, infinite, infinite direction, you can call it like that,

25:28.880 --> 25:32.880
so when you look at the tree in the distance there, your consciousness is right there,

25:32.880 --> 25:37.600
at that distance, I don't mean like your consciousness is there as if you're here now,

25:37.600 --> 25:41.840
so if you walk there you'll see your consciousness, no, from your orientation right here,

25:41.840 --> 25:46.640
yeah, that distance there, the consciousness is out there, and the extended distance goes,

25:46.640 --> 25:52.560
the extent of the consciousness is just gone, because otherwise you wouldn't even perceive that,

25:52.560 --> 25:56.400
you wouldn't even perceive the color or the difference of everything if it's not manifested there

25:56.400 --> 26:02.160
as it is in the distance, even if that distance that's just perceived by itself, it's already conscious,

26:03.040 --> 26:08.880
consciousness is there, distance is conscious, matter is conscious, you just find it all there,

26:08.880 --> 26:13.920
yeah, and that's the only reason you can actually appropriate it, and that's the only reason

26:13.920 --> 26:20.000
why the other hand should be possible, because if you were not finding it there and appropriating it,

26:20.000 --> 26:24.560
you couldn't free yourself from it, in other words if you were really creating consciousness

26:25.200 --> 26:27.040
and controlling it and directing it, that's it,

26:28.640 --> 26:33.840
really ready, well there is no gap for any movement, it's all sealed, closed, done,

26:33.840 --> 26:41.120
and you're stuck, a point being no, there is a mistake going on, which is you don't see that

26:41.120 --> 26:48.160
you already find things already there, you don't see that, that's why you misconceive them,

26:48.160 --> 26:57.440
as mine, as my creation, as I'm the master, as myself, and what do you find already there,

26:57.440 --> 27:06.560
whatever has the nature of manifesting, even a fleet in thought,

27:08.640 --> 27:14.400
the fact that it has appeared, the fact that you did not, the fact that you just

27:15.760 --> 27:23.840
have it appeared to you, means it came on its own, the other way it's open on its own,

27:23.840 --> 27:30.720
same feeling, intention, anything, the fact that it appears, means it did not come from you,

27:32.640 --> 27:36.080
you just met it, meeting of the three is content,

27:39.120 --> 27:46.240
so you just met it ignorantly and you assumed you were contacted, it is my aimless,

27:46.800 --> 27:51.760
but if you meet it with that understanding, that is, well yeah, then you're not contacted,

27:51.760 --> 28:00.480
so whatever, whatever manifests, it's already there, given by itself on its own,

28:01.360 --> 28:06.400
you just find it there, which is nothing else than saying, whatever has the nature of arising,

28:06.400 --> 28:15.040
has the nature of ceasing, in other words, whatever is manifested, has the nature of manifestation,

28:15.040 --> 28:22.160
is in its nature independent of me, and if something is independent of you means it comes and goes,

28:22.720 --> 28:28.800
and you cannot do anything about it, and if something is independent of you, means it is not yours,

28:30.000 --> 28:39.200
doesn't obey you, doesn't listen to you, but you don't, you see that part, default,

28:39.200 --> 28:44.480
I'm seeing that it's, yeah all of these, yeah, limitation of talking about it, it's just one insight,

28:50.880 --> 28:55.920
yeah I see, I do not say that there is, that there is the development of mindfulness,

28:55.920 --> 29:14.160
I'm breathing for one who is forgetful, but when you contemplate, I shall breathe in contemplating

29:14.160 --> 29:22.400
impermanence, contemplating within which fading away cessation, on that occasion it

29:22.400 --> 29:29.600
bicker by contemplating mind objects as mind objects, having put away covetousness and grief for

29:29.600 --> 29:38.400
the world, having seen with wisdom the abandonment of covetousness and grief, he closely looks on with

29:38.400 --> 29:52.960
anonymity, that is the occasion of bicker by contemplating mind, yeah that having seen with wisdom

29:52.960 --> 29:58.960
the abandonment, he knows he sees it, it knows, and then the result is in difference,

29:58.960 --> 30:08.080
yeah, and he applies to it, establishing your mind on indifference, if you get okay,

30:12.080 --> 30:19.920
yeah that's interesting, yeah, well see the thing is your mind needs to be quite strong already,

30:19.920 --> 30:23.760
you know the established, yeah because those are more refined phenomena,

30:23.760 --> 30:30.880
like stone or something like that, or body or material things, it's easy to relate to,

30:30.880 --> 30:37.520
so that's how most people inevitably will have to start, but yeah if your mind gets established

30:37.520 --> 30:43.200
upon the thought, well you can get established to such a phenomena, so general, so ambiguous,

30:43.200 --> 30:49.120
when you look at it from a daily kind of worldly point of view, just say infinite consciousness,

30:49.120 --> 30:57.760
but that is a real phenomena, it is real as such, so if you see at the extent that it's present,

30:57.760 --> 31:04.160
which is very subtle, and you get established upon it, well you'll be quite skilled in mind

31:04.160 --> 31:11.280
establishments, in genres and everything else, or even further neither perception or no perception,

31:11.280 --> 31:17.840
yeah, and ultimately cessation of perception and feeling, you get established in that state,

31:19.200 --> 31:27.760
but see now when you think about it, infinite consciousness, that thought is in a way that

31:27.760 --> 31:33.520
which infinite consciousness is, because all you have is your own experience, obviously your mind

31:33.520 --> 31:39.840
is not trained in regard to that phenomenon, but if you keep dwelling on it long enough,

31:39.840 --> 31:46.960
accurately, mindfully, it will become more and more accurate in terms of when you think infinite

31:46.960 --> 31:52.720
consciousness, it will more and more start to stand for that which infinite consciousness really is,

31:56.080 --> 32:03.280
so as I said before, no matter how abstract thought is, it's abstract only in relation to its

32:03.280 --> 32:14.960
content, in itself it is very real, because usually abstract means you dismiss it,

32:16.400 --> 32:20.560
because it's not real, but the nature of abstraction is very real,

32:25.680 --> 32:30.800
you have the word in the book, you think, yeah, so there is already some significant, the fact

32:30.800 --> 32:35.520
that you can designate it, even as an ambiguous abstract term, means there is some significance good,

32:36.080 --> 32:39.360
means, well, it is experienced in such way,

32:47.280 --> 32:53.200
so you might think infinite consciousness in relation to this present body right here on this chair,

32:55.200 --> 32:58.880
and in a way you can become established upon that, then after a while,

32:58.880 --> 33:05.680
you will become apparent that what you established is your thought of what infinite consciousness is

33:05.680 --> 33:11.120
in regard to this body there, and that's also fine, it's not a mistake, it's just that now,

33:11.120 --> 33:17.040
you can see well actually, if infinite consciousness is what the sutra say infinite consciousness is,

33:17.040 --> 33:23.200
then there is infinite consciousness in regard to my thought too, now just in regard to the body there,

33:23.200 --> 33:28.400
so you have infinite consciousness in regard to your thought of what infinite consciousness is,

33:32.080 --> 33:35.280
and that is really such, but see it's much subtler now already,

33:37.200 --> 33:41.360
but nevertheless, if your mind gets skilled in phenomena, then dama,

33:44.400 --> 33:49.120
you just start seeing these things from what they are, to the extended appear, you see them to

33:49.120 --> 33:54.080
the extended appear, you want to be overcompensating through ignorance, or you won't be ignoring them through

33:54.080 --> 33:59.920
ignorance, you will see them for what they are, to the extent that they have a reason,

34:02.400 --> 34:05.680
so if the general thing you see is general things, but if you see the particular thing,

34:05.680 --> 34:08.960
you won't be making general into particular particular into general how do you confuse it,

34:09.760 --> 34:12.800
and overattending or underattending or misattending or whatever else,

34:12.800 --> 34:18.960
the only somanasikara means that, means having attention that doesn't really

34:20.160 --> 34:30.000
that sees the way it has a reason, at its root, at its origin,

34:30.000 --> 34:45.440
and it's about a super putting with seeing things,

34:45.440 --> 34:51.520
yeah that's another stem see, a super, like now you can say a super, it can be an abstract term,

34:51.520 --> 35:03.120
but again, the fact that you were able to designate it even in such vague terms, it is real as such,

35:05.200 --> 35:09.760
so then you start dwelling on it, and if you dwell on it you might start seeing more of it,

35:10.800 --> 35:16.960
and then you might understand the nature, the point being that's why again we spoke earlier,

35:16.960 --> 35:21.440
learning comes first, you need to learn, you need to know what you're supposed to look for, what, how to

35:21.440 --> 35:26.880
look for, because otherwise you can't, things won't show themselves, show you the truth by themselves,

35:26.880 --> 35:31.280
and you didn't, wouldn't need the Buddha, any spiritual teaching would do, because that's all they say,

35:32.880 --> 35:37.200
so you need to know what to look for, so once you find out what to look for, you start looking for,

35:37.200 --> 35:48.880
so in terms of a super you need to know to look for the aspect of ugly or non-beautiful, in everything,

35:48.880 --> 35:57.920
why, because it is there, beauty is sort of, it's relevant, sorry it's relative, in the same sense

35:57.920 --> 36:02.880
that ugliness is relative, it's ugly only relation to something that is less ugly,

36:02.880 --> 36:11.280
but see, now because we get so dependent and attached and infatuated by beauty,

36:12.800 --> 36:17.920
you think in terms of beauty, so if it's something ugly, you know, you really, you might say ugly,

36:17.920 --> 36:23.680
but for you it really means it's less beautiful, oh it's really not beautiful, but beautiful is

36:23.680 --> 36:28.800
the reference you think through, and for as long as you think through the reference you're

36:28.800 --> 36:35.520
maintaining your central dependence, but view of centrality really, craving for centrality,

36:35.520 --> 36:41.200
emotional beauty, yeah, you see it brings to beauty, yeah, so even if you're not seeing any

36:41.200 --> 36:45.360
beautiful objects, you still see them through the beauty if you're unestablished, so they'll

36:45.360 --> 36:52.960
just see in this less beautiful, so what you need to do is reverse that because it's possible,

36:52.960 --> 36:58.720
because again you can attend it either way, there is absolutely no reason to attend it is beautiful,

36:58.720 --> 37:04.880
no more justified reason, the only reason is your ignorance, so you start overriding that,

37:04.880 --> 37:11.760
you start overriding your ignorance, because there is the aspect of repulsive in everything,

37:11.760 --> 37:15.840
and what is that aspect, it's the very fact that those things are completely indifferent towards

37:15.840 --> 37:23.920
you, independent of you, and that's quite, well especially if you're infatuated, that is quite

37:24.560 --> 37:31.040
not nice, cold, but then you change that, and you start looking at everything like that,

37:31.040 --> 37:36.240
and then things that seemingly give care for you, you can just see them as, oh slightly less

37:36.240 --> 37:43.120
independent, but still see them through that ugly aspect, so the infatuation, the criteria of

37:43.120 --> 37:53.520
beauty, this is to be the motivator for your action, because everything can be attended beautifully,

37:54.080 --> 37:58.320
or non-beautiful, out of habit, you attend everything beautiful, even ugly things,

37:59.200 --> 38:04.400
so that's what it means, you become really skilled in seeing through that dependence,

38:04.400 --> 38:09.520
which is what it's meant in those situations, because it says he sees a beautiful, ugly,

38:09.520 --> 38:14.480
ugly is beautiful, beautiful is beautiful, ugly is ugly, he can do any either way, his mind is

38:14.480 --> 38:23.360
developed, yes ugly, so if you're seeing things as ugly, like even beautiful would be just less

38:23.360 --> 38:29.520
ugly, still ugly, shit, you're a really bad smelling shit, and slightly less smelling shit,

38:29.520 --> 38:35.600
but it's still equally a shit, like you wouldn't go and grab a shit because it smells less,

38:35.600 --> 38:44.560
it's still a shit, vice versa, if you keep seeing it as beautiful, you will go to a very ugly thing

38:45.360 --> 38:50.240
out of despair, and just recognize it as a beautiful attractive aspect and go for it,

38:51.520 --> 38:56.080
you know when there are no beautiful women around, well you take what you can get,

38:57.200 --> 39:03.280
so the standards drop, if you're in prison, you go after men with resembles women,

39:03.280 --> 39:10.480
or not even that, again all through seeing things, like not being able to break free from

39:11.040 --> 39:18.720
dependence, craving for beauty, but when you reckon it's beautiful and start seeing it as ugly,

39:19.680 --> 39:23.680
you will eventually, you won't happen overnight, because it's, you know,

39:23.680 --> 39:27.520
deeply rooted habit, essentially, but it will fade out because you're not maintaining it,

39:27.520 --> 39:33.200
it needs maintenance, so if instead of beautiful and less beautiful, you start seeing

39:33.200 --> 39:43.600
it less ugly and ugly, you will get dispassionate, as well as the looking at pictures or something.

39:46.000 --> 39:53.280
Well it gives you initials per, but if you don't recognize what the actual purpose and the point

39:53.280 --> 39:58.080
of the whole thing is, you can be based in your walls with the super images, it's not going to

39:58.080 --> 40:01.520
do anything, well after a while you're probably still getting attracted to, oh well yeah,

40:01.520 --> 40:08.640
it might be mutilated corpse, but look at the breast on it, yeah, yeah, you need to see the ugly.

40:09.840 --> 40:14.960
If you establish your mind upon the ugly, however, you can have the most gorgeous naked woman

40:14.960 --> 40:21.680
right in front of you inviting you, and you will generally not want to, you will be repelled by it,

40:23.040 --> 40:24.960
why? Because it is generally repelling,

40:24.960 --> 40:34.800
it's actually ugly is more fundamental, more structurally, more primordial than beautiful,

40:34.800 --> 40:40.800
beautiful requires attraction, and then you start seeing ugly is beautiful, you get infiltrated,

40:40.800 --> 40:49.840
ugly doesn't require anything, doesn't require passion to work, which is again why sensuality is

40:49.840 --> 41:03.760
possible to bring fever. You, beauty requires attraction, requires

41:19.840 --> 41:43.120
attraction, there's even a, I do not delight even, or even a little bit of being,

41:43.120 --> 41:50.080
like I do not delight in the due to the feces, yeah, yeah, why? Because even like a fingernail

41:50.080 --> 41:56.240
amount of shit, it's still shit, smells like shit, looks like shit, feels tasty, tastes like shit as well,

41:56.240 --> 42:12.240
but everything, everything, everything that exists,

42:16.400 --> 42:21.280
all these independence, everything that manifests, why?

42:21.280 --> 42:29.920
For the reason that it has manifested itself, so basically the, how to put it,

42:31.760 --> 42:38.640
the way out, like the key to freedom, is in the fact that you're being imprisoned,

42:40.080 --> 42:43.920
it's right there, the fact that you're imprisoned means you can be free,

42:43.920 --> 42:53.040
so the fact that things arise, and you take them as my, and they imprison you, they'll wake you,

42:53.040 --> 43:00.160
means that they're not yours to begin with, which means, yeah, you can escape,

43:00.160 --> 43:09.200
exactly, from their imprisonment, so the proof in things and permanence is in its manifesting

43:09.200 --> 43:14.800
permanence, because that permanence is manifested itself by itself on its own,

43:14.800 --> 43:18.000
you're nothing to do with it, means, oh, this is impermanence,

43:20.080 --> 43:24.480
for that very reason it will, for the reason that it has manifested itself,

43:24.480 --> 43:33.120
for that very reason it will have to cease, nothing else, so its manifestation is its end,

43:33.120 --> 43:38.480
and shows that end is implicit, there's nothing to do with it,

43:44.400 --> 43:51.920
that someone could fall, has to go further as well, maybe to think, like I said,

43:51.920 --> 43:55.680
I'm free from this, no, I'm free from prison,

43:55.680 --> 44:04.480
to notice that freedom, so, yeah, well, people can reduce that, they can get a claim,

44:04.480 --> 44:10.400
so they can read something, oh, we're already free or something, but then you have to be self-transparent,

44:10.400 --> 44:15.520
so you can say, oh, yes, unfree, but then, okay, well, can the suffering still arise?

44:16.400 --> 44:22.080
So you just, you just bring in another question in criteria, and put two and two together,

44:22.080 --> 44:26.640
because according to this teaching, that show me the glimpse of this impermanence,

44:27.360 --> 44:32.880
being free means free from suffering, so now I know honestly, if I ask myself,

44:32.880 --> 44:38.320
can the suffering arise for me, in any form, any shape whatsoever, in the future or whatever,

44:40.400 --> 44:44.000
can it, can it do so, if you see, yes, I'm not really free,

44:44.720 --> 44:48.000
but not free to the, to the sufficient extent, to say, I'm free,

44:48.000 --> 44:53.920
am I worried about something? Exactly, so, oh, so even if you say, yeah, but still you're free,

44:53.920 --> 44:58.160
well, okay, what's the point of this freedom, if I'm not free from suffering, because that's a

44:58.160 --> 45:03.760
whole point of freedom, being free from pain, being free from, prospect of pain, yeah,

45:06.880 --> 45:12.560
well, here now, in regard to the future or whatever, so, as I said, remember when I told you that,

45:12.560 --> 45:18.080
when I read that, now I can't remember saying, oh, well, you're already the all-sot upon us, when I was

45:18.080 --> 45:23.360
learning that I did so, actually, wow, so I'm already sot upon it, but then at the same time, I thought,

45:23.360 --> 45:29.040
well, okay, even if that is true, what difference does it make? If my amount of suffering has

45:29.040 --> 45:34.880
not changed, or my amount of being liable to suffering has not changed, what's the point,

45:34.880 --> 45:41.120
even if I call myself another, there's no point, unless obviously I practice it for the wrong reasons,

45:41.120 --> 45:45.600
but if you practice it generally for the freedom from suffering, then becomes the only measure

45:45.600 --> 45:49.760
only criteria you care about, and only criteria you should be care about, because that's what the

45:49.760 --> 45:56.400
Buddha said himself, only two things, suffering and freedom from it, that's the sole purpose, sole

45:56.400 --> 46:06.800
pastes, absolutely the only thing that the teachings consider about, nothing else, suffering and freedom

46:06.800 --> 46:14.960
from it, so you can think, oh, see, I'm already free, okay, great, how did that affect my suffering,

46:15.760 --> 46:21.200
my liability to suffering? Well, it feels like it might have felt, okay, what, keep doing it then,

46:23.040 --> 46:25.600
it makes no difference whatsoever, keep doing it then,

46:25.600 --> 46:37.760
yeah, there you go, yeah, you said the whole point,

46:56.000 --> 47:06.800
first of all, the pleasure that comes from janas and being secluded from it, it's not something you

47:06.800 --> 47:15.440
can crave for, you can't really conceive it as a feeling, because, no, because the feeling now

47:15.440 --> 47:18.960
implies, well, because the only pleasure you're familiar with, is pleasure of centrality,

47:18.960 --> 47:26.480
but if you withdraw yourself from it sufficiently, then you can discover a different type of pleasure,

47:29.600 --> 47:33.280
that it's completely free from underlying tendencies, and that's pleasure of janas,

47:33.280 --> 47:36.960
pleasure of seclusion, pleasure of freedom,

47:36.960 --> 47:46.320
because through a soup, you can be noted, you see the obvious, reaches this passion,

47:46.320 --> 47:50.880
reaches the security from passion, and then feels pleasant on account of that,

47:50.880 --> 47:56.000
but that's basically a janas, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm telling you about in janas,

47:56.000 --> 48:01.200
like janas, it's nothing, well, first of all, you see that in Anapanasalti, it's not mentioned

48:01.200 --> 48:05.520
at all, leads to forefootation and mindfulness, leads to forepowers, leads to self-factors

48:05.520 --> 48:09.600
and enlightenment, leads to our nature, no mention of janas, why? because janas are completely

48:09.600 --> 48:16.000
different things, it's not like direction, particularly directly, it's a particular way of establishing

48:16.000 --> 48:21.360
yourself as a result of this passion, so whether you reach that this passion through Anapanasalti,

48:22.160 --> 48:26.240
you can establish yourself in janas, sure enough, just to say that, whether you reach that

48:26.240 --> 48:31.200
this passion through looking at a suba, you can establish yourself in janas, whether you reach

48:31.200 --> 48:36.480
that this passion through thinking about what jana is, you can establish yourself in jana,

48:37.360 --> 48:42.240
but this whole nonsense, that all came with this premediting, overmediting, mismediting,

48:42.240 --> 48:47.520
where you expect your crave for things like a hyena looking for a prey, waiting in front of a

48:47.520 --> 48:55.680
rabbit hole, and then you have the transcendental feelings and noble play bodily experiences,

48:55.680 --> 49:00.560
and then now I'm going to second jana, third jana, oh yeah, I've seen, I'm going back to first one,

49:00.560 --> 49:08.560
say nothing to do with it, absolutely nothing to do with it, I mean it states quite secure from

49:08.560 --> 49:18.640
central pleasures, he updresses, he abides, he abides, he enters and abides in that state,

49:18.640 --> 49:23.200
the people are in the bind, no, then the Buddha said whether you'll be walking in that state or

49:23.200 --> 49:33.840
talking in that state or sitting in that state or doing it, and he's mind remains established.

49:36.080 --> 49:41.920
Yeah, he's saying the article in the mindfulness of the body suit, it says,

49:43.280 --> 49:51.680
he went, when mindfulness is so full, whatever way the water jug, we have a tip, so

49:51.680 --> 50:00.240
it goes, yeah, you just have to direct his mind to jana or whatever, whatever, once, you just

50:00.240 --> 50:10.080
have to fill it up, he will go somewhere, and that's how he also people develop supernatural powers

50:10.080 --> 50:17.200
in the suit, they don't develop them by kind of doing some special practice, they develop mindfulness

50:17.200 --> 50:23.840
and then it says, if there was an opening, he recognized his previous life, if there's an opening,

50:24.640 --> 50:31.920
so if there is another way that this mindfulness can be, this jug full of water can be tipped,

50:31.920 --> 50:35.440
because for some people there is, for some people there is an opening, and there aggregates a

50:35.440 --> 50:40.080
lot of remembrance of more aggregates, some people don't, Sariputta, I was just reading the

50:40.080 --> 50:48.160
earlier, nothing, he said he could not, nothing, he couldn't see, not even just for one person

50:48.160 --> 50:52.160
in the future destination, he couldn't remember anything, none of his future lives, none of his previous

50:52.160 --> 50:57.440
lives, future destination of people, no deeper job, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, he couldn't

50:57.440 --> 51:05.600
see even a mere goblin, yet he was absolutely the foremost, the marshal of the Dharma, the

51:05.600 --> 51:13.200
surface calling, after the Buddha, the most supreme, in development, he says nothing to do it,

51:13.200 --> 51:17.280
it's just like circumstantial, some people can remember, some people can't,

51:18.480 --> 51:24.320
like you have blue eyes, somebody has red eyes, as far as the code to you, if you mindfulness

51:24.320 --> 51:33.280
is so full, it will manifest itself, if there is an opening, you don't do anything,

51:33.280 --> 51:37.280
and you see when they kind of acquire the three or four knowledges, previous lives and everything,

51:38.080 --> 51:42.400
they were not doing that, they were committed to the Buddha's instruction, freedom from suffering,

51:43.280 --> 51:47.200
they penetrated the truth, they fully realized, and then the knowledges came,

51:47.200 --> 51:51.360
and then they came, and then that came, as a result of them, fully developed the mindfulness

51:51.360 --> 51:52.960
of the extendacity for the final knowledges,

51:52.960 --> 52:09.280
the signs of, of a sign, don't walk on the grass, is a picture of your absence from that loan,

52:10.800 --> 52:17.520
that's nimita, for that sign, so you just, so yeah, for an untrained mind, those nimitas like wow,

52:17.520 --> 52:21.440
revelation, but that doesn't just thoughts, in relation to the reason things that you face to your

52:21.440 --> 52:28.160
senses, a super nimita would just be, a super nimita would be exactly that, dwelling upon the

52:28.160 --> 52:34.160
thoughts of repulsive in regard to the particular thing, so it's a nimita in regard to it's a sign

52:34.160 --> 52:40.800
and feature of a certain thing, you only, that sort of says, when he establish mindfulness, when

52:40.800 --> 52:44.640
things come through his senses, he doesn't give attention to any signs of features, the word is nimita,

52:44.640 --> 52:54.400
yeah, so initially when you come across the beautiful sign of features, sex,

52:55.920 --> 53:00.160
yeah, it's restrained of the senses, so that's the first nimita that hits you,

53:01.120 --> 53:04.800
but then you get established upon the repulsive, you're going to have different significance

53:04.800 --> 53:09.280
of that experience, you have different nimitas, you have different signs and tokens,

53:09.280 --> 53:12.280
We are experiencing the meters all the time.

53:12.280 --> 53:15.280
Well, the limit is just like intentionality.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.280
Thoughts, that's how you operate.

53:20.280 --> 53:24.280
In many examples, the Buddha goes to see the body.

53:25.280 --> 53:27.280
He looks at different parts of it.

53:27.280 --> 53:31.280
But he goes to whatever is started in the body,

53:31.280 --> 53:34.280
like head, his test, his brain.

53:35.280 --> 53:37.280
All those things, all of this in this particular thing,

53:37.280 --> 53:40.280
is just reinforcing this aspect,

53:40.280 --> 53:43.280
the nature of solidity that is present there.

53:44.280 --> 53:46.280
And then you get established in that.

53:46.280 --> 53:48.280
And then, okay, well, then there are these things that are not solid.

53:48.280 --> 53:50.280
So, less solid is water.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.280
So upon that established aspect,

53:52.280 --> 53:54.280
you establish another aspect.

53:54.280 --> 53:56.280
Upon that aspect, you establish another aspect.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.280
Upon that aspect, you establish another aspect.

53:58.280 --> 54:00.280
So, four elements, so you have everything.

54:00.280 --> 54:02.280
Nothing is not covered.

54:04.280 --> 54:05.280
So it's good, actually.

54:05.280 --> 54:07.280
Well, it's good.

54:07.280 --> 54:09.280
Yeah, for that reason,

54:09.280 --> 54:11.280
if you expect some magical limiters,

54:11.280 --> 54:13.280
it's not going to happen.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.280
If you are doing it for the utter dispassion

54:16.280 --> 54:18.280
in regard to experience as a whole,

54:18.280 --> 54:20.280
and then you get established upon that,

54:20.280 --> 54:22.280
then yeah, and then limiters will happen.

54:22.280 --> 54:25.280
But they won't be mystical kind of manifestations.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.280
They will be like, ah,

54:27.280 --> 54:30.280
now you start recognizing a significance.

54:30.280 --> 54:33.280
So it seemed manifold, this establishment.

54:33.280 --> 54:35.280
Like earth, then everything solid,

54:35.280 --> 54:37.280
everything water, everything this.

54:37.280 --> 54:39.280
It seemed like you're doing it.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.280
But after a while, if you keep doing it,

54:41.280 --> 54:43.280
if you keep practicing it,

54:43.280 --> 54:45.280
that dispassion over things,

54:45.280 --> 54:47.280
that becomes a thing.

54:47.280 --> 54:50.280
No matter how manifold was in your doing an intention,

54:50.280 --> 54:52.280
when it's being experienced,

54:52.280 --> 54:54.280
it's experienced as a thing or a thing.

54:54.280 --> 54:57.280
It has its own limiters.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.280
The two recommenders.

54:59.280 --> 55:00.280
So next time you get those limiters,

55:00.280 --> 55:02.280
you get that experience.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.280
You get experience, you get those limiters.

55:05.280 --> 55:07.280
So you start recognizing signs and tokens

55:07.280 --> 55:12.280
to bring back establishment instantly.

55:12.280 --> 55:14.280
So through the establishment, for example,

55:14.280 --> 55:16.280
wandering on the element of earth,

55:16.280 --> 55:17.280
the element of earth,

55:17.280 --> 55:19.280
the more you are established,

55:19.280 --> 55:22.280
the more implications that phenomena will reveal.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.280
So to speak.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.280
In the same sense, the more you dwell on the beautiful,

55:25.280 --> 55:27.280
the more aspect of beautiful you're going to get.

55:27.280 --> 55:29.280
You want to be grateful.

55:29.280 --> 55:32.280
In the same sense, you dwell on the indifferent,

55:32.280 --> 55:37.280
like a quite sublime aspect of the earth casino,

55:37.280 --> 55:39.280
what you're going to get.

55:39.280 --> 55:44.280
You're going to get its own significance of solid,

55:44.280 --> 55:45.280
of everything.

55:45.280 --> 55:48.280
All of those are limiters in relation to their earth.

55:48.280 --> 55:51.280
And all of those things become new ways,

55:51.280 --> 55:52.280
new tokens, new signs,

55:52.280 --> 55:54.280
to bring back establishment of earth.

55:54.280 --> 55:56.280
In the same sense, now I have to say,

55:56.280 --> 55:59.280
woman, and the aspect of beauty is back,

55:59.280 --> 56:02.280
even if you don't see any particular woman.

56:02.280 --> 56:03.280
Why?

56:03.280 --> 56:05.280
Because you are so familiar in skill

56:05.280 --> 56:08.280
in wandering on those aspects.

56:08.280 --> 56:11.280
But later on, it will not be for you to think,

56:11.280 --> 56:13.280
if you establish yourself on casino earth,

56:13.280 --> 56:15.280
you just think solidity,

56:15.280 --> 56:18.280
and you establish upon the element of earth.

56:18.280 --> 56:20.280
Yes, I'm noticing that.

56:20.280 --> 56:23.280
Even if foam, the foam,

56:23.280 --> 56:26.280
it will be like that.

56:26.280 --> 56:31.280
And it will be the entry point to that same plant.

56:31.280 --> 56:33.280
That's the whole thing.

56:33.280 --> 57:00.280
That's the whole point.
