1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So how's your meditation going?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I got a couple of emails about the thoughts.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's very, I'll show you what it's contemplative.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The thing is, actually before meeting you,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or other Saturdays, or it's told me that it's very important to reduce the time of thinking.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, I got myself many times for people.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I understand actually what you explain,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because if I try to control something,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
it means, actually, based on something, I need to control,

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
based on self-view, actually, because of that,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and I try to control it.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So maybe that is...

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I understand it, but...

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The only thing with that is,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
for as long as you don't think that everything is in your head,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so to speak, you know, at some of the speed,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
because they are, it's all in my head.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's not, it's real.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Anything that appears, through any of the senses,

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
it appears as a phenomenon,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which means, from that point of view, it is mental.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It pertains to the mind.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So even things that you see, objects around you,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
again, they're real where they are,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and they are material, but you know them for what they are,

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
you perceive them for what they are,

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
all of that has this founding mental aspect.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So obviously, you have things that are more mental,

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
so to speak, like when you think about your thoughts,

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
about your past, future, some,

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and then you have the immediate experience of the things

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that you're seeing, hearing, touching, tasting.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
None of those things would be known,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
if that's already not a form of thought,

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
which is why all of the five senses,

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
they meet in the mind, which acts as a six,

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
in that regard.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So I just wanted to clarify that,

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
because sometimes people get,

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
oh, it's all in my head, it's all my thoughts,

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and then they use that to dismiss

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
real things around them.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, it's not real, because just in my thought,

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
well, your thoughts are very real.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And things here, things here,

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
things in between, that's all very real.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's just a thinking on that properly,

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
could help people overcome the assumption

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
of the external world,

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
exists, and then I am in it,

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and then I can think in regard to it.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But the fact that you can even designate

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the external world,

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
in, well, whichever designation you choose,

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the fact that you can do that means

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
it's already perceived, somehow,

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and as such, it's actually a thought.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's a dharma, like a phenomenon,

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
which means it's not really an external then.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's external aspect,

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it's only relative to something which is

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
maybe less external,

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
but fundamental, there is no external world that you,

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
that it's independent of you,

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
because in that case, you wouldn't be even conceiving it,

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
you couldn't.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Is it that before I remember,

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
if I see the tree,

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
my consciousness is out there?

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, that's definitely, like, see,

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the tree outside is real,

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
when you look at it, and it's there.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But again, the designation there,

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
the designation tree,

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
all of that, it's already perceived

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
on the level of the mind, and that's what the consciousness is.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So in that sense, you can say, yes,

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
it's more correct to say the consciousness

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
is with that matter of that tree

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
than in your head,

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
that's just a result of it.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Is it important that some people

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
they say that,

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
suppose, if I keep thinking,

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
it's about the tree or something,

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but actually, your teaching is actually,

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
with maintaining the mind

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
for the supplement,

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
maintaining the mind for this on the body,

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
for the posture, something,

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
why are we mindful of the body itself?

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And then, I should be mindful of the other thing.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's quite an opposite.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Difficult assumption.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Attention, use your stays on one object.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, the attention usually goes after something.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So the point is to learn how to be mindful of the experience

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
as a whole, all of it.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No matter what particular things you're attending,

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
whether it's a tree,

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
or it's a cup, or it's whatever,

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
that's all particular,

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but you want to remain mindful on the general level

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
of the experience as a whole,

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
which is why I would refer to it as a mindful of the background,

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
mindful of the peripheral.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because it's not what you're attending,

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it's the negative in regard to that.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, it's the background of that thing

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that you're fully attending right now.

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And because it is still present,

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
in a form of a background,

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
you can say it's slightly less present

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
than the thing that you're fully attending.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But it's still present.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So mindfulness means training your mind

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
to recognize the degree of the presence of that background,

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and not interfere with it.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So you get established upon it.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And then you remain mindful of the background,

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
no matter what particular things

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that are rising and how powerful they are,

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
or they might be.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It means why reading the book or something,

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
you are always aware of.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, you look harder when you read the book,

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
because reading a book means reading the ideas,

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
the thoughts,

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you have to think about it.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So it requires more of your attention.

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So if you read the book,

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
yeah, okay, read the book.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Focus on what you're reading in the book.

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But it's more like,

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
if you're doing things that are not necessarily

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
requiring 100% of your attention,

139
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
sweeping the leaves,

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
washing the dishes, or whatever,

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you can be mindful of your experience

142
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
in regard to what you're doing right there and then.

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So writing a complex letter

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
would require most of your attention to it.

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Still, you can be mindful in regard to that,

146
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
but you don't have to worry about too much.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Like, oh, I lost my mindfulness.

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I think, well, you didn't really.

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You just diverter your attention more

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to the thing that you willingly mind

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
from it decided to do beforehand.

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So then that's absolutely fine.

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's not like if you're passing

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
that which is actually impossible,

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
that you can maintain constant sort of awareness

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
of the present or it's a contradiction in terms.

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It doesn't work like that.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because even that idea of the constant present moment

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
has a reason on the background

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that you're completely not seeing.

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then you're just expecting everything

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to exist to the same degree right in front of you.

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And when it doesn't, oh, I lost my mindfulness.

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I wasn't the mindfulness to begin with.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How do you understand the word

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
of attachment?

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How do you explain the word of attachment?

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, I am super-dana.

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I translate it as assumption.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How do you...

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is it something like a usually people's

172
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
speaker or something dangerous?

173
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But attachment means something

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
thinking about something.

175
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, it's a bit more subtle.

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's subtle than that.

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're attached to things

178
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
when you take them to be yours.

179
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Even that background I'm talking about,

181
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
like the background that appears

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
like the less your experience as a whole,

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
that's already what you've taken to be yours.

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The basis for your everyday experience,

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
which is the experience of your senses

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
in regard to the world,

187
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
your eye, your ear, your nose,

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that's already taken as mine.

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So even if things are right in front of you,

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
you're not necessarily yours.

191
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, like, I don't know,

192
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
this torch that I'm holding is not mine.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, all of the senses that I'm using

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to experience are being helped by me,

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
which means in that way,

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
in that experience of that torch,

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
which is in mundane levels, not mine,

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
it's still mine,

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
because I took it through the senses.

200
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And then always the things that

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
yours, even on a mundane level,

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
they're even more yours.

203
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But if you undermine that,

204
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
if you recognize that you can't actually own

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the senses to begin with,

206
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
it's impossible.

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Not knowing that you can't own it,

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you take up the ownership.

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You find out that you can't own it,

210
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you don't own it.

211
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So it's mutually exclusive,

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
it's either or you either own it

213
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
or you don't.

214
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you want to not own it,

215
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and you can do that only by fully understanding

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that you could not have owned them,

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
in other ways.

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And that means whatever,

219
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
then you experience an account of those senses,

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
you can't even conceive that to be yours,

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
or to imply your sense of self,

222
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
or to be for you, or anything like that.

223
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In the case of Arya,

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Arya, that they have,

225
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
they don't have,

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
they have some attachments still,

227
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
but they don't have any save of you.

228
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What kind of attachment is it?

229
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well, it's,

230
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
well, as the similar in the synthesis,

231
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
like, imagine there is a poisonous arrow

232
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
stuck in your flesh,

233
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
that's sort of still oozing poison,

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
still making the whole wound,

235
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
in fact, in the sun.

236
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So the first thing is to take that arrow,

237
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
take out that source of poison.

238
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So when you take that out,

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you can say, okay,

240
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm further poisoning of the wound.

241
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The source is taken out,

242
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but it will still take some time,

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
until the poison that is still inside,

244
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
kind of,

245
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
evaporates, this disappears,

246
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
until the wound heals.

247
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So that's basically what a sacred is.

248
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Somebody who has taken out,

249
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
that poison is dead,

250
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
or ignorance,

251
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
but it will take some time now,

252
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
depending on how hard he applies himself,

253
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
how carefully he attends to his wound.

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It might not take long,

255
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but it might take longer,

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
if he is not dead careful.

257
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But either way, there is no more doubt,

258
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
there is no more poison coming in,

259
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
which means sooner or later it will heal.

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It will clear itself out.

261
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So are you,

262
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
when they see something,

263
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
he never thinks,

264
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
that's his,

265
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but he has no identification,

266
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
basically.

267
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, it depends, really.

268
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There is a, like,

269
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
for someone, he is free from the self-view,

270
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
which means

271
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
he still possesses a degree of,

272
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
let's say, attachment

273
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
in regard to things around him and so on.

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But overall,

275
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
he can never, ever again,

276
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
assume that his sense of self

277
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
exists independently of his own experience,

278
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
which is usually what Buttigiegna thinks.

279
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Not even so clearly,

280
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
but the assumption is that

281
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
your self is independent of your five aggregates.

282
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's independent of your body,

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
if you mind, it's independent of everything.

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's permanent.

285
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, that view is completely gone

286
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
for a sort of one,

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
which means he can't even conceive that anymore.

288
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He knows that whatever it is there,

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
he has a reason and such,

290
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
it will come to cease.

291
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Even if it's his current sense of self,

292
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that he's still not quite extinguished,

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
his conceit and so on,

294
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
he knows, even that,

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
there is a permanent,

296
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and he won't stay forever,

297
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
which means he does not take even that

298
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
as ultimate, as eternal.

299
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But it will take time

300
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
until that,

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
one more particular level

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
these things clear themselves out.

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And if he makes the better quality effort,

304
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
more effort,

305
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
he will get there quicker.

306
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What do you think is independentism?

307
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Dependent organization?

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No, that's completely not even seen.

309
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If you ask an everyday person

310
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
about the sense of self or whatever,

311
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
nobody will doubt that they are.

312
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I am.

313
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Most of them probably won't be able to tell you what they are,

314
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but the sense of self is undeniable.

315
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And the degree that they have taken

316
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
that undeniable sense of self for granted,

317
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
makes it almost feel as if it's completely independent

318
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
of anything you're experiencing,

319
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
whether feeling perception intentions

320
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
it just feels entirely

321
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
myself is kind of myself.

322
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's the same self.

323
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And that is a standard out of one,

324
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
that is a view where you think

325
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
that your sense of self exists independently

326
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
of your mind, of phenomena, of your experience,

327
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
of things that are rising in positive,

328
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
just don't even see the connection between the two.

329
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So recognizing connection,

330
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
recognizing that no matter what sense of self,

331
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
no matter how ambiguous,

332
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
how well-established, how undeniable it is,

333
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
it's still a thing that you can talk about,

334
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
which means it exists as such.

335
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It exists as an ambiguous,

336
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
undeniable vague peripheral general sense of self,

337
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but it's real as such,

338
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and you start recognizing it on that level,

339
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
which means you start recognizing it for what it is.

340
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And when you see that it's just another reason thing,

341
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
like other reason things,

342
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
it slowly becomes apparent that,

343
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
yeah, that too is subject to impermanence

344
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and because it's subject to impermanence,

345
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
it cannot possibly be my eternal self.

346
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think actually very contemplate on this too.

347
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Actually, I think this is something of what you are realizing,

348
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
or the picture, I think,

349
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that itself taking, of course,

350
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
everything up here in the mind,

351
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
or the thought, I think,

352
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
call the picture as taken as self,

353
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and something like not something like a self-exit,

354
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
something separated,

355
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
not that kind.

356
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I think maybe,

357
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
whatever you are realizing,

358
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
or the picture is just taken as self.

359
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm thinking that everything is in my control.

360
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's the meaning of self,

361
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
but I think you're in that division.

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah, well, all of those pictures,

363
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
all of those stories are arising,

364
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
they are arising in regard to a background.

365
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And that's for your sense of self-exit.

366
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So if you're not mindful,

367
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
if you're not recognizing background,

368
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
to the extent that it is a background,

369
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
means you're taking it to be yourself,

370
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and as such, whatever arising that arises for yourself.

371
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So even if you're not necessarily thinking this is me,

372
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
this is my arising for me,

373
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
in front of me,

374
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can see that I can think about it,

375
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I, and those remains,

376
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I always remains the center of that experience.

377
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But if you see that even that I,

378
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
is another thing that has a reason.

379
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
On that level of that background,

380
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that's a different story, because if you see it as a background,

381
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you'll see, oh, well,

382
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that background is only background in regard to something

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
that it's right in front of you,

384
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
which means background is determined by that thing.

385
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And vice versa,

386
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
background determines the actual,

387
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
because it can only arise,

388
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
something can only arise directly,

389
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
based on the peripheral bases.

390
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So it's mutual determining,

391
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and you realize, well, whatever,

392
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
yourself goes,

393
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
it will be either here or there.

394
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There is no in between or the third place that you don't know.

395
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's either the background,

396
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
because both of these things

397
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
mutually determine each other,

398
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
which means none of them can remain standing on their own.

399
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And if that is the case,

400
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
there is no room for the self,

401
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
which is usually the implication of

402
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
being able to stand by itself alone.

403
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You mean the background,

404
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
still in standing,

405
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
so you mean the rec as a receiver,

406
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
all the things, what do you mean?

407
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can call it a chair, yeah, you can call it.

408
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You can just say it's a background,

409
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
because it's a background.

410
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The general ambiguous less defined thoughts,

411
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the domain of those,

412
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
that's a background.

413
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
If you like, when people start using the terms,

414
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
like the witness,

415
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
the observer, the receiver,

416
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
then already implies

417
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
that they have taken that very much

418
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
to be their self.

419
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Because background is not witnessing anything.

420
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Background is a background.

421
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Background is only a background,

422
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
because it's not foreground.

423
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And then which is foreground,

424
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
is a foreground, because it's not background.

425
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And then you realize that,

426
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you recognize that all the possibilities

427
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
of your current foreground,

428
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that's all they need in the background.

429
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The new things you can attend

430
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
based on the current,

431
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
things that you've been attending,

432
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and so on.

433
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So that way you can't create anything,

434
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
you just find things already there

435
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
or reason in that background,

436
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
which determines what's right in front of you

437
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
because you can attend it,

438
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
as something that, as there isn't,

439
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
on account of that background.

440
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But another way it also works as well,

441
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
because when you attend something directly

442
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
right in front of you,

443
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
that defines what,

444
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
what you're attending is that,

445
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
which is not the background,

446
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
which means,

447
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
in relation to that,

448
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
everything else is the background.

449
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So that's what Niano Riro is talking as well.

450
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The actual determine is the peripheral,

451
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
so it refers to the background

452
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
or the general experience as a negative experience

453
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
in regard to the positive thing you're attending.

454
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But negative is determined only by the positive,

455
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
by not being positive,

456
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
hence the negative.

457
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And positive is determined by that negative as well,

458
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
by not being that negative.

459
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So that's why anything

460
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
can become positive,

461
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
downright in front of you,

462
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
or the negative form of determination.

463
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And if the aggregate,

464
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
it all depends on how you're attending it.

465
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Well, I contemplate sometimes,

466
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I just feel like,

467
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
usually, this body is considered

468
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
like a prop container,

469
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and you need to do things arising in the mind.

470
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And just this whole picture,

471
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
it just taken itself,

472
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you've got this canister,

473
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
why this general peripheral,

474
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
these two things should be separated.

475
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Well, you're trying to separate them,

476
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
you're trying to separate them

477
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
on a direct actual level,

478
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
which means that's not really

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the background I'm talking about.

480
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
When you start comparing

481
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
all actual and peripheral,

482
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
those are actually both actual for you.

483
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Because peripheral is only that

484
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
which you're not attending.

485
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The background of your attention,

486
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
right there and then,

487
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
which means if you want to look at it

488
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
with your attention,

489
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
it just becomes another actual.

490
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And something else now,

491
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
is that which you're not looking at.

492
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So it's learning how to see that

493
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
without having to directly look at it.

494
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
How to proceed with it?

495
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It can happen.

496
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, you can, it's possible.

497
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And that's what Yonisomanasika means.

498
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The proper attention,

499
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
depending on how you translate it.

500
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yonisom means the womb,

501
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
so usually your attention

502
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
pulls you out there

503
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
at whatever you're attending.

504
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But it does, it's almost like a formal direction

505
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
between, it has been directed.

506
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And that place of origin

507
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
where that attention came from,

508
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that's something people know mindful

509
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
because mindful of,

510
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
because that's the background of what they're attending.

511
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's the negative.

512
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So in the same sense,

513
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
your eye cannot see itself.

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But you will, you can discern it

515
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and know that it's there

516
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
based on the things that you see.

517
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Eye, anything, sights.

518
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So in the same sense,

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
the fact that you're already

520
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
find your attention attending things,

521
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
you can know it's roots.

522
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You can know where that direction came from.

523
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There is no solid source

524
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that emits attention.

525
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Not knowing that there is no solid source

526
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
that emits this attention

527
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
is basically why people assume

528
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
that there is a solid source,

529
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
which is a sense of self.

530
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Always, no matter what culture,

531
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
what background people are,

532
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
whenever there is a sense of self,

533
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
it will always be the point of origin

534
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
of my attention, my intention,

535
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
my will, my volition.

536
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's inseparable from the sense of self.

537
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But if you were to see

538
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
that actually there is no solid point

539
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
of it, it's just the direction.

540
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Kind of almost infinite

541
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
in both directions.

542
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Come from a solid point.

543
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You're just finding there attending.

544
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And then attending this is then attending that.

545
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So you can start to discern

546
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the origins of their direction

547
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
in a sense of the background

548
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
of what's being attended

549
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
by there and then.

550
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And that's what you only see

551
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
when a secara is.

552
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Recognizing things on a more general level

553
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
while you're attending something else.

554
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Directly.

555
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And that recognition

556
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
can come

557
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
like with that attention.

558
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So to speak.

559
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
As I said before, if you

560
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
are attending something

561
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and then just

562
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
you're aware of the background

563
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
to some extent.

564
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But then if you look at it directly,

565
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
it's not the background anymore.

566
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's another direct thing.

567
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So you have to learn how to see it very thoroughly,

568
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
how to see without moving your sight,

569
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
without having to look at it.

570
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm aware of that already.

571
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's already in front.

572
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, not necessarily.

573
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's in front when you attend it.

574
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So you have to learn how to be aware of it.

575
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because you are aware of it.

576
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You don't agree.

577
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Everybody is.

578
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's how intentions operate.

579
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But you have to learn how to remain aware

580
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
without needing to attend it.

581
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Or in this case,

582
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
over-attended.

583
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In which means basically

584
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
what's kind of extracted from that background

585
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and now it's being fully attended.

586
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So that's what the body posture

587
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and some of these things are inherently

588
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
almost always in the background.

589
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And establishing mindfulness upon that

590
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
will mean you're establishing mindfulness upon the background.

591
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's not as much

592
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
as a container

593
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
for your experience.

594
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
As you said, it's more

595
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
a necessary random cause

596
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
for your experience.

597
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The body,

598
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
bodily organs, just the living body,

599
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
it's there in the world.

600
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Same as every other object you can see.

601
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's a particular,

602
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
it's the most specific object

603
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
because it has an nature

604
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to be the reason for your experience as a whole.

605
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like, if there is no living body,

606
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
there's nothing you can experience.

607
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And you can't even conceive experience

608
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
without your living body.

609
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But then the living body is

610
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
an object in the world.

611
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's just a part of matter for great elements.

612
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's just there, a subject

613
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to elements, subject to aging,

614
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
to getting sick to die.

615
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Subject to everything.

616
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Just as you know, the stone is subject to whether

617
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
the animal is subject to other.

618
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's just out there.

619
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yet it is the thing because of which

620
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
your whole experience is there

621
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and you know it,

622
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
whichever way you know it,

623
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,000
including your body.

624
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I think because the body is already there,

625
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
is that because of which

626
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
you're able to designate things

627
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
including the body.

628
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Sometimes I feel that there might be some meaning

629
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
that some, of course,

630
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
that's actually quite natural,

631
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
but sometimes I contemplate.

632
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Sometimes we always use something

633
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
like reacting to some outside

634
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
of the people.

635
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But suppose some people,

636
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
if someone tells me something

637
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and if I get angry,

638
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
actually everything is happening within.

639
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Nothing to do with others.

640
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But sometimes I lose mindfulness

641
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and then I feel that person is wrong.

642
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Not my fault.

643
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
He is a one problem that it's something to me.

644
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But he contemplates

645
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
everything is happening within our mind.

646
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Just reacting to it.

647
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Well, it doesn't really matter where it is happening.

648
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Well, matters is that you are affected

649
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
by what's happening.

650
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Things can happen inside,

651
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
it can happen inside, outside,

652
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
it can happen inside and outside.

653
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The point is they are happening

654
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and you are affected by that.

655
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So that's what you want to be concerned with.

656
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Not where it's happening,

657
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
how, why,

658
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
what reasons.

659
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You want to be concerned with the fact

660
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
that you are affected by whatever

661
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
it's happening.

662
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And you can eventually overcome that,

663
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
but again,

664
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
by learning how to not exclude

665
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
things out of your experience,

666
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
whether direct, whether peripheral,

667
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
you have to develop mindfulness

668
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
of your experience as a whole.

669
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So if there is the experience of unpleasant person

670
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
telling you something offensive, unpleasant

671
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and you are emotionally upset

672
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
on account of that,

673
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
well, all that is already one experience as a whole.

674
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
There is the living random body

675
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
in the world

676
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
that happens to be closest to you

677
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
because of which you are what you are

678
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and you are able to hear this person speak

679
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and think on account of it

680
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and get upset.

681
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And that's all simultaneous

682
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
because for as long as that living body

683
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
there is present,

684
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
means your whole experience

685
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
will stand on it.

686
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And you can be distracted here.

687
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay.

688
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
For as long as your experience

689
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
for as long as the living body is present,

690
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
while it's present,

691
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the whole domain of the senses,

692
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
thoughts,

693
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
interaction with others, all that will stand.

694
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
If there is nobody,

695
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
none of this can stay even for a second longer.

696
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's a single ten years.

697
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So start seeing it like that.

698
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Eventually you will start recognizing

699
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
inherently that you're not able to hold,

700
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
you're not able to,

701
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
because that random body there,

702
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
it's clearly not in your control

703
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and you don't possess that.

704
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yet it is the reason of your experience.

705
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Which means that,

706
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
which means that

707
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
the very foundations

708
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
of your experience

709
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
are inaccessible to you.

710
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So that means that your whole experience

711
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
equally cannot be yours.

712
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Including your pollution,

713
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
your intention,

714
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
anything that closes associated to the sense of self,

715
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you see that is fundamentally undermined

716
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
by the fact that

717
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
you're in no control over the four great elements,

718
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
they're basically the reason for,

719
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
for the shape of your body,

720
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
functionality of your body,

721
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
life associated with conscious and spirit,

722
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
that's removed,

723
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
all of which is gone.

724
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So it's not about addressing,

725
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
sorting out the person that upset you or anything,

726
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
just surmounting the whole picture,

727
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
and then in order to discern that,

728
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
actually,

729
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
this could not have been yours to begin with.

730
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And that's the whole point.

731
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Then you will not be affected by whatever arises.

732
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Even if it's you,

733
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
not a horrible experience,

734
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
sometimes they're really worried about it as soon as.

735
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But the other hands, they were not affected by it.

736
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I think,

737
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
but in the case of Pututana,

738
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
how it is, sometimes it's important

739
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
to the, like,

740
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
choosing the thinking,

741
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
the content,

742
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
something has to choose.

743
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Otherwise, I wish sometimes,

744
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I believe I keep thinking about the tree or something.

745
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And if I keep thinking about the tree or something.

746
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Well, what you should do then,

747
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
you should start thinking about yourself,

748
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
thinking about the tree,

749
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
or thinking about yourself doing this,

750
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
or thinking about yourself,

751
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
thinking something else.

752
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Don't just think that,

753
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
or do that.

754
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
That's how you start developing mindfulness.

755
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Seeing yourself do things.

756
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Seeing yourself think things.

757
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What that's been seen

758
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
will be recognized.

759
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh, this is just another thing that I am seeing.

760
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And as such,

761
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
it's a reason phenomena,

762
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
which means he's subject to all of those,

763
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
it's subject to impermanence,

764
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
suffering,

765
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and therefore it cannot be taken itself.

766
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But you have to keep seeing it like that,

767
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
because the tendency

768
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
for the sense of self is to be,

769
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
a privileged position in regard to your whole experience.

770
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Which means,

771
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
you might see it as a thought,

772
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
you might see it as a consequence,

773
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
you might see it as a phenomena,

774
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
but it's always assumed to be more.

775
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But by constantly seeing yourself doing things,

776
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
you're getting more familiar with it,

777
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and being more familiar,

778
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
you're seeing it clearer,

779
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and you realize there isn't anything more to this.

780
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
How can you be,

781
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
how can you start assuming consciousness

782
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
that are,

783
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
how can you be aware of consciousness?

784
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You can't. You can't be aware of consciousness,

785
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
because it's your contradiction in terms.

786
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But you can discern,

787
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
you can know that consciousness is there,

788
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
as that direction I was talking about

789
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
in regard to the attention.

790
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So recognizing the nature of direction

791
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
means recognizing the nature of consciousness.

792
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And consciousness is out there,

793
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
with that random matter.

794
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's that random matter

795
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
that's the post-consciousness

796
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
that your life is here known for what it is.

797
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Usually people assume, again,

798
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
comes through that directionality

799
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
of the sense of self

800
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
as being the source for, you know,

801
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
the me-speaking,

802
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
thinking, doing things and so on.

803
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But basically, whether it's me here,

804
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
things out there, younger,

805
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
all of that is already there together

806
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
because of that conscious body.

807
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Which means even the sense of space

808
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
is secondary.

809
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Here, there, here and there.

810
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Sorry, here and younger, here and younger.

811
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
All of that is already given there.

812
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And that there is that background

813
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm talking about.

814
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So it's not here, in here,

815
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
as opposed to the objects around me,

816
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
both are actually already there,

817
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
given, and known as thoughts

818
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
as representation, as dama,

819
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
whatever you want to translate it.

820
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Actually, if I see that I think that

821
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
the B-personal, that kind of practice

822
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
actually is mistaken

823
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
because actually there is something

824
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
like a thinking with this,

825
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
some teachers, they teach

826
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
like a B-mindful with the movement

827
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
of the body.

828
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But then like a drawing the right between

829
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
this body and the outside.

830
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But it's already mistaken there.

831
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It will just be reinforced

832
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
in the same mistake you began with.

833
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Not just you don't want to be

834
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
drawing the line in between,

835
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
but you don't want to actually

836
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
be focusing constantly

837
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
on what's right, what's your

838
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
what's actual, what's actual.

839
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Because the harder you try to focus on that,

840
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the more oblivious of the background

841
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
you will be. You will not be seeing it.

842
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Which means

843
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
less and less foundation for mindfulness.

844
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Which it's not accidental

845
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
that all the people

846
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
will seriously get into the B-personal,

847
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
intense, very wonder.

848
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Because it's just you

849
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
constantly just trying to catch

850
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
you, trying to see it.

851
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And I was just saying to you there

852
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
that the similarly in the

853
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
sutras where the Buddha said the person

854
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
without the right view, he mismeditates,

855
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
premeditates, overmeditates,

856
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
undermeditates, says it's like a

857
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
jackal waiting by the bins

858
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
for the mouse to come out

859
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
or bird waiting for the fish.

860
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You're just praying, praying, praying

861
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
just waiting for it

862
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
as an animal

863
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
which is hunting.

864
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And that's a completely wrong attitude.

865
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It's completely directed out there.

866
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
There is no background. There is no seeing yourself

867
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
waiting for a mouse to come out of the bin.

868
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Because if you go,

869
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
you will recognize, well,

870
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
whether we're looking for a mouse or

871
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
whether it's after the element.

872
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The point is to see myself what I'm doing.

873
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And that's how you can also start distinguishing

874
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
wholesome and unwholesome.

875
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
By unwholesome things you don't really

876
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
think about and maybe later.

877
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But if you get used to seeing

878
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
yourself doing things,

879
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
thinking things, feeling things,

880
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
whatever,

881
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
you will then always have that

882
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
like an extra space

883
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
to whatever has a reason

884
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
from which you can have a clear

885
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
point of view.

886
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You can see that, well, yeah,

887
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
no matter how much I'm pulled or whatever,

888
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
this seems inherently unwholesome.

889
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So I think there is nothing to worry about

890
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
something, some people,

891
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
even just reading the book or some people,

892
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
they worry that people too much,

893
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
like getting absorbed in it and...

894
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why would you worry? Because that random

895
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
body, living body,

896
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
paid with consciousness is already there.

897
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Whether you're reading the book or not,

898
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
it's already there.

899
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So you just have to learn how to maintain that knowledge

900
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
without the need to be constantly

901
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
bringing it to your mind.

902
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
What do you mean?

903
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The knowledge of your

904
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
random living body there,

905
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
which is the reason for your whole experience

906
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
of reading the book.

907
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
That knowledge is really,

908
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
it's a real thing. It's a base for mindfulness.

909
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Because it's the right knowledge.

910
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It pertains to the things as they are.

911
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
If you know it,

912
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
you don't have to keep asking

913
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
yourself or reminding yourself,

914
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
whether you know what you have to do

915
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
that in the beginning.

916
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You have to do that in the beginning.

917
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But later on, you don't.

918
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The knowledge is there.

919
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's what I mean. In the beginning, you will have to

920
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
stop doing whatever you're doing

921
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
in order to remind yourself

922
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
of the order of mindfulness.

923
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But you do that only so that,

924
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
okay, now reminding myself,

925
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
now let me continue doing what I was doing

926
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and try to remain mindful

927
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that one percent of the background,

928
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
as I spoke before,

929
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
for as long as I can.

930
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The person is completely opposite.

931
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Stop being mindful of that background

932
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and just focus as hard as you can

933
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
to whatever it's right in front of you.

934
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Not seeing the background.

935
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's basically like, imagine,

936
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I don't know, what would be the similar?

937
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay, fishing rod.

938
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You throw the fishing rod

939
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
into the water and then you have to wait for the fish

940
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
to grab the bait.

941
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You throw the rod, you take it out,

942
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
you throw it, you throw it, you throw it, you throw it, you take it out.

943
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And then it becomes a goal in itself.

944
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And that's what you don't want to do.

945
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So, yeah, sometimes you have to attend back

946
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
to the things, to the reasoning, to the thoughts,

947
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
to what you've read, based on mindfulness.

948
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Only so to relieve it.

949
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And see if it's going to settle the proper way.

950
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
When you forget about it, then okay.

951
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Remind yourself again.

952
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But that's the thing.

953
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I have to keep it right in front of your mind all the time,

954
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
because that's impossible.

955
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You want to be able to let it go,

956
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
like, seep into the background,

957
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and still be aware of it.

958
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
No matter how far it goes,

959
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
you're aware to that extent.

960
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But you're still aware.

961
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's why even 1% of such mindfulness

962
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
is actually more than enough

963
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
to be fully established

964
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
in the attitude of mindfulness.

965
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's actually that for me,

966
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
it would be to be fully established,

967
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
to have 99% of your attention

968
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
needing to be mindful, no.

969
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Because mindfulness is a structural thing.

970
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's not something you do.

971
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
What have to do in the beginning, yes,

972
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
because you don't know what it is.

973
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Once you discern it, knowing what mindfulness is,

974
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
is what makes you mindful.

975
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Suppose if I'm mindful of the body posture,

976
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
it's in my background.

977
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Is it the same?

978
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
The thing is, you can be mindful of it actually.

979
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
If you're thinking about your body posture,

980
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
then your body is always the background,

981
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
but now you're also thinking about it.

982
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So it's present in both ways.

983
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But sooner or later you have to stop thinking about it,

984
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and when you do,

985
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
you still want to be able to remain aware of it as a background.

986
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Be aware.

987
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah, because it is there.

988
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's the thing.

989
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Your body is there.

990
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Even if you forget about it,

991
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
it is there in a certain position,

992
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
in a certain posture, doing something.

993
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And if somebody was to ask you,

994
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
how is your body now,

995
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
you would be able to give the answer right away.

996
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Which means the knowledge of that is there.

997
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's just not being recognized.

998
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
If I'm aware of that,

999
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
it means that already it's in front of you.

1000
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Now, if you're aware,

1001
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
if you can be aware of where it is,

1002
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
if you append it,

1003
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
then you make it in front.

1004
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Because whether you append something or not,

1005
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
you're aware of it.

1006
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So awareness is more fundamental than the attention.

1007
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Structurally.

1008
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It means that our awareness is not noticed.

1009
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, I don't know this.

1010
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
If you're not noticing awareness,

1011
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
then you're unaware.

1012
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I know where.

1013
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But awareness as a potential is there.

1014
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Because if you weren't cleaned,

1015
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
you wouldn't wake up,

1016
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you wouldn't be able to become aware.

1017
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
What's the difference between awareness and consciousness?

1018
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Well, let's say the consciousness

1019
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
is that direction given to you.

1020
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Direction that comes from that random body.

1021
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
No, both of the water is present all the time.

1022
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah.

1023
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Awareness is present all the time.

1024
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Well, awareness is probably all the time.

1025
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It is potential all the time.

1026
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But if you don't know it,

1027
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
then you're unaware.

1028
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I don't know where.

1029
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But you see time always over the back time.

1030
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
No, you're always in the direction.

1031
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
There is always a background.

1032
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
If there is a direction or something,

1033
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
it means it has been directed from some point.

1034
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And that's the background to where it is.

1035
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So there is always that direction, that background.

1036
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So it's always possible for you to recognize it,

1037
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
to know it, to be mindful of it.

1038
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But it doesn't mean that you always are mindful of it.

1039
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Hence the point of the practice of dharma.

1040
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Background, to see the background is important,

1041
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
because I have to see the self,

1042
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
from fear, from fear I'm attending.

1043
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But you can't see yourself directly.

1044
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah.

1045
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And then say this is not myself.

1046
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You just want to start including everything,

1047
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
actual and peripheral, foreground and background.

1048
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And if you do that long enough,

1049
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
you will start to discern that your sense of self

1050
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
can't be in between the two.

1051
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It's either the foreground or background.

1052
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And as such, it can't be permanent.

1053
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's by not knowing that,

1054
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you assume yourself to be in limbo.

1055
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So neither foreground or background,

1056
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
it's everywhere and nowhere.

1057
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That's only because you don't really know

1058
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
either foreground or the background.

1059
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And that's that's your experience.

1060
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Usually, the view is usually standing background.

1061
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But it's not seen.

1062
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But before I remember,

1063
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I spoke to you a lot,

1064
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
something about meditation.

1065
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
In meditation, usually, I see that

1066
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
the whole picture of the mind,

1067
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
of course, being mindful of the body.

1068
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But at the same time, in the mind,

1069
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
what kind of thought arising?

1070
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I see that.

1071
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And then you, I remember,

1072
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I have to see the whole picture,

1073
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the whole picture that I'm taking in this mind.

1074
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It means me or myself.

1075
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So I have to see the whole picture,

1076
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
no need to focus on the one thought.

1077
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's the same.

1078
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, we'll see it.

1079
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Like again,

1080
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
you're sort of repeating what I said,

1081
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
but you're not saying it in the same way.

1082
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And the difference is, again,

1083
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
that being mindful of the background

1084
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
means being mindful of your experience as a whole.

1085
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But when you say,

1086
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I have to see the whole picture,

1087
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
that means I have to attend the whole picture.

1088
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So you're trying to put it all in front of you.

1089
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And that's not what I'm saying.

1090
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Because no matter how much you manage

1091
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
to put it in front of you,

1092
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
there's always going to be background to it.

1093
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And if you don't recognize it,

1094
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
it means you have left quite a good bit out.

1095
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And that's where yourself is going to be then.

1096
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But if you start seeing,

1097
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
okay, this is actually what I'm doing,

1098
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
while with the back of my mind,

1099
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm mindful of myself doing that,

1100
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
which is already a formal background

1101
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
for what you're doing.

1102
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Eventually, you recognize that there is no room

1103
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
for yourself to be anywhere in between,

1104
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
or left, or it will be either here or there,

1105
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
as such, it will pertain to either here or there,

1106
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and it won't be that sense of independent self.

1107
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It means that,

1108
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
it means the purpose of the practice

1109
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
is that to find out that there is nothing

1110
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
actually can find that as a self,

1111
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
that's suppose that if I'm mindful of the body,

1112
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I have to...

1113
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
To find out that your sense of self,

1114
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
basically, is not independent.

1115
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Because at the moment, for a particular sense of self,

1116
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
feels independent of anything,

1117
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and everything.

1118
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So by always practicing mindfulness,

1119
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
well, by developing the extent of mindfulness,

1120
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
for as long as it's necessary,

1121
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
then it can become apparent that,

1122
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
even that sense of self,

1123
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
that appears that can be talked about,

1124
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
can be designated,

1125
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
it's not independent.

1126
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's depending upon this reason background,

1127
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and these things that I'm directly attending,

1128
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
whatever they may be,

1129
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
sweepingly,

1130
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
washing dishes,

1131
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
rigging books, whatever,

1132
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
while your body randomly living,

1133
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
is present there, your sense is working and so on.

1134
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So you realize the sense of self,

1135
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
it's usually was hiding kind of in between,

1136
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
by not knowing either of those things.

1137
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
But now that you've practicing mindfulness correctly,

1138
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
in regards to the experience as a whole,

1139
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
means sooner or later,

1140
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
that sense of self will lose that

1141
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
independence,

1142
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and you just, well,

1143
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
even if there is sense of self,

1144
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
it's not mine.

1145
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It cannot be mine.

1146
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And that's what not self means.

1147
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I said it before,

1148
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
it doesn't mean there is no self,

1149
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
means that that which is taken as self,

1150
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
is not yours.

1151
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Cannot be yours.

1152
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And that's the thing,

1153
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
it concerns you,

1154
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
ah, this is not myself,

1155
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
that's not how you overcome the sense of self.

1156
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You overcome that by knowing that,

1157
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
that cannot even be your sense of self

1158
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and could not have been your sense of self.

1159
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And then it won't be your sense of self.

1160
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So why are you moving?

1161
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You are using the main thing in mindfulness

1162
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
that I am doing this,

1163
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
that I'm washing the carpal.

1164
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You're thinking about that.

1165
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So you can be washing the carpal over there,

1166
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
but you don't want to have to be telling yourself,

1167
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I am washing the carp,

1168
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I am washing the carp.

1169
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You want to know,

1170
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
you want to be seeing yourself

1171
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
with the back of your mind,

1172
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
seeing yourself washing the carp.

1173
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
So it's, let's say,

1174
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
let's put it like this,

1175
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
it's a bit more relaxed

1176
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
than needing to constantly attend it.

1177
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I am washing the carp,

1178
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I am washing the carp,

1179
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I am holding the carp.

1180
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
No, you already picked up the carp,

1181
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
you don't have to keep telling yourself,

1182
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
what you're doing,

1183
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
you know what you're doing.

1184
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So you just want to,

1185
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
almost like,

1186
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
almost imagine,

1187
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
another view,

1188
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
looking at you,

1189
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
doing this,

1190
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
but not interfering,

1191
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
not telling you anything,

1192
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
just keeping an eye

1193
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
on what you're doing.

1194
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And that's the practice of reflection.

1195
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You just reflect upon yourself,

1196
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
doing whatever you happen to be doing.

1197
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It means not keeping someone

1198
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
like outside,

1199
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
you know,

1200
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
some people,

1201
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
they advise you

1202
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
to really keep someone,

1203
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
like the observer.

1204
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah, but there's a thing,

1205
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
if you start keeping the observer,

1206
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
you start assuming

1207
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
that observer to be your

1208
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
more real self.

1209
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But no,

1210
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
the only reason you can reflect

1211
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
upon yourself doing something

1212
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
is because you're doing something,

1213
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
you're able to do something.

1214
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So that particular thing you're doing

1215
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
is the reason,

1216
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
or rather,

1217
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
that particular body

1218
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
that you're using

1219
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
in doing these things,

1220
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
is the reason

1221
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
that you're alive,

1222
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
that you're able to think,

1223
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and do these things,

1224
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and discern them

1225
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
as something to be done.

1226
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So no matter how far you go

1227
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
in your reflection,

1228
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and your observer,

1229
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
or whatever else,

1230
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
that will never be independent

1231
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
of this living body

1232
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
right here,

1233
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
that it's washing the dishes.

1234
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And vice versa,

1235
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
washing the dishes

1236
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
will never be intelligible or known

1237
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
if there is no reflection

1238
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
in regard to it.

1239
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Hence, now,

1240
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
you should determine

1241
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
each other like the two sticks,

1242
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
you move on,

1243
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the other one falls,

1244
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
instantly.

1245
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So that anchor is anything

1246
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
working,

1247
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
like a background,

1248
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
it depends on the person

1249
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
that some people

1250
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
they like to keep,

1251
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
anchoring in some

1252
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
regular breath,

1253
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
or something.

1254
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Anything working well.

1255
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Well,

1256
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
everything can be an anchor,

1257
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
but not,

1258
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
there doesn't

1259
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
say we mean that people can actually

1260
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
establish an anchor

1261
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
of mindfulness in everything.

1262
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
What's the purpose of anchor?

1263
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I mean,

1264
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
it's a disability.

1265
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Well, anchor means mindfulness.

1266
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Anchor in that means

1267
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
you're mindful of that.

1268
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You are reflecting upon yourself

1269
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
while you're washing the dishes.

1270
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You're mindful of the background

1271
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
while you're washing the dishes.

1272
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And when I say mindful of the background,

1273
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I don't mean mindful of different things.

1274
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I mean,

1275
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I wash the dishes,

1276
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
but I'm listening to this sound,

1277
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
which,

1278
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
because of that, I mindful no.

1279
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Wash the dishes means

1280
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
you're mindful of your body washing the dishes.

1281
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So you're mindful of standing.

1282
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You're mindful of the given body,

1283
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
while you're doing particular dishes

1284
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
with your hands and so on.

1285
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Well, you can even be mindful of the intention.

1286
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
To wash the dishes.

1287
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Because for as long as you're

1288
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
intention to have the dishes washed,

1289
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
is present,

1290
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
you'll be washing the dishes.

1291
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
When that intention changes,

1292
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
you stop doing it.

1293
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Either because you finished

1294
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
or because something more important came up.

1295
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But that's the thing.

1296
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
What people do,

1297
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
they don't see them.

1298
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So you have the intention to wash the dishes,

1299
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and you start washing the dishes

1300
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and you forgot about the intention to wash the dishes.

1301
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But it's actually still present there,

1302
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
just now in that background,

1303
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
on a more general level.

1304
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Why? Because if it were not present there,

1305
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
you wouldn't be picking up the sponge,

1306
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
taking more washing up liquid,

1307
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
getting another cup.

1308
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But all of that is bombed

1309
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
by a more general intention of having these dishes washed,

1310
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
having the sink clean.

1311
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And if you're mindful of that more general intention,

1312
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
they're still there.

1313
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So you don't have to create it,

1314
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
fabricate it,

1315
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
you just have to disown it because it's there.

1316
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Then you'll be mindful of whatever particular things you do

1317
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
on account of that intention.

1318
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And that's just,

1319
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and that intention and so on,

1320
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
it's another thought.

1321
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But it's a more subtle thought.

1322
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Then the actual thoughts you're having

1323
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
while you're washing the dishes.

1324
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It means if my mindfulness is on the body posture,

1325
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
then being aware of the intention.

1326
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You can be mindful of your body posture

1327
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and then don't interfere with your thoughts

1328
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
and what you're doing,

1329
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
why are you mindful of your body posture?

1330
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That may be simple.

1331
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I didn't know what I'm doing with that scene.

1332
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Whatever you're doing,

1333
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
you can do only because your body is still there alive.

1334
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Senses are working and functioning.

1335
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So if you're mindful of that body,

1336
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
body posture more specifically,

1337
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and then allow yourself,

1338
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
allow your mind to go and do things.

1339
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
While peripherally,

1340
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
you do, like,

1341
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
keep the corner of your eyes,

1342
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
so to speak,

1343
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
on that body posture,

1344
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
while you're doing this stuff.

1345
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And that will always already be a more accurate practice

1346
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
of mindfulness.

1347
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So you don't want to be overly intending,

1348
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
overly intending things.

1349
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You don't want to be,

1350
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm washing the dishes,

1351
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm washing the dishes,

1352
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I'm standing, I'm standing, I'm standing,

1353
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
because they're just bringing things forward,

1354
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
forcefully,

1355
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
which means you'll never ever see that background

1356
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
and there won't be any anchor established in it.

1357
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But if you recognize that this standing body,

1358
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
or sitting body,

1359
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
this body in itself,

1360
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
for as long as it's alive,

1361
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
will be the direct reason for this whole world,

1362
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
existing and standing,

1363
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and these feelings,

1364
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
experience and so on.

1365
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
If those elements break apart,

1366
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
if they're taken away,

1367
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and they will be,

1368
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
because I have no idea

1369
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
where they came from,

1370
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
how they're given,

1371
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
or how can they even be,

1372
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
what they can't even be accessed in any way,

1373
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
but they are the reason

1374
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
for your whole experience as a whole.

1375
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So when those four great elements go,

1376
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
you can't even conceive the experience

1377
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
to remain standing.

1378
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So how about you just simply

1379
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
do body contemplation?

1380
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
This is body contemplation.

1381
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Well again,

1382
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
if you do it correctly,

1383
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
it's fine.

1384
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
But if you're doing body contemplation,

1385
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
in terms of just bringing things forward into your mind,

1386
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
while not seeing the background,

1387
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you won't be mindful of it.

1388
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Body contemplation over to see the body contemplation.

1389
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Well, body contemplation,

1390
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
the correct one in the sutras,

1391
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
it's just recognizing the random parts of the body,

1392
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
as that, because of which,

1393
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
you're able to even think about the random parts of your body.

1394
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Taking the body as mine.

1395
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Yeah, that's the result of it.

1396
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
How is it,

1397
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
isn't going to be,

1398
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
is it teased at the right of the body

1399
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
feeling in common,

1400
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
the changing?

1401
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's not feeling.

1402
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The sensation they talk about,

1403
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
is just the bodily perceptions.

1404
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
But obviously,

1405
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
by calling them feelings,

1406
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
they kind of give them a more prominent position,

1407
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
which results if you can observe that

1408
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
long enough, you'll be purified.

1409
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But that's already the contradiction in terms.

1410
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
There is no moving feeling through your hand or through your arm.

1411
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That's a sensation.

1412
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You can call it that's a perception,

1413
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
which means you think your perception is what you feel.

1414
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So you're more confused than you were before you started doing that method.

1415
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Contemporary on the perception

1416
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
that the changing in common is positive.

1417
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Nothing.

1418
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Why is that relevant?

1419
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah.

1420
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Why is it relevant how my elbow feels?

1421
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It doesn't matter.

1422
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Mine is hurt.

1423
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So what?

1424
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
The main problem is

1425
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
you're taking the body as mine.

1426
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
No.

1427
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The main problem is not,

1428
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
he doesn't know the way out of unpleasant feeling.

1429
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That's the main problem.

1430
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
That's why protrusion is protrusion.

1431
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
He doesn't know for no truth.

1432
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But it's the truth.

1433
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So you can say that his body

1434
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
for the eternity,

1435
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
he's looking in the wrong place.

1436
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's not why and how I feel this body

1437
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and how it changes and how it moves.

1438
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's why do I not know escape

1439
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
from the feelings that arise

1440
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
dependent on this body?

1441
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Any feelings?

1442
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Can't escape because

1443
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
taking the body as mine.

1444
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Well, they can escape

1445
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
because they don't know what escape is.

1446
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But if someone here

1447
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
like contemplated this body

1448
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
with airmen, firemen,

1449
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
some of these are the changing...

1450
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Again, is there doing it

1451
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
running from to them

1452
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
overattending it?

1453
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It will not stand for that

1454
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
which elements are.

1455
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Because elements are always

1456
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
the background.

1457
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
The four grey elements

1458
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
can be discerned

1459
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
and recognized

1460
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
in that very distant background.

1461
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
That is present.

1462
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It's right there and now,

1463
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
but it's much, much, much subtler.

1464
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And unless your attention

1465
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
has been trained

1466
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
to the subtler levels,

1467
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
you just won't be able to see it.

1468
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You look like,

1469
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
well, imagine you have a lens.

1470
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Camera lens or a pair of glasses, whatever.

1471
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
That it's only for a certain distance.

1472
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Like 50 millimeters to 80 millimeters distance,

1473
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
which means anything before that you won't see.

1474
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
No matter how close you look,

1475
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
you're just overseeing it.

1476
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And then that's basically

1477
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
untrained attention.

1478
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You're just used to overattending things.

1479
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
That's what you used to regard.

1480
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
That's what you're able to recognize.

1481
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Anything less than that you won't see.

1482
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So with person with such attention,

1483
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
even if they think about elements,

1484
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
or whatever they want to be thinking about elements,

1485
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
they think what they are.

1486
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But they'll think about that,

1487
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
which they think elements are,

1488
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
based on that scope of attention that they have.

1489
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But if you start training your attention

1490
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
in regard to the background,

1491
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
you start seeing more of that direction

1492
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
without actually having to change it.

1493
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Why?

1494
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Is it how to contemplate

1495
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
all the implements of the body?

1496
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Well, again, if you,

1497
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
your body right there right now,

1498
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
whatever, you have saved

1499
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
position and you have saved more particular things.

1500
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
But overall, that body aging,

1501
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
that body growing, that body getting sick,

1502
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
that body being subject and permanent,

1503
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
you can't stop that.

1504
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You can't even conceive

1505
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
how it would be if you could control it.

1506
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It's just inaccessible to you.

1507
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And if you clarify that,

1508
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
you can start seeing that body

1509
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
as actually a reason for your whole life,

1510
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
for your whole experience,

1511
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
for everything.

1512
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Everything you ever experienced,

1513
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
everything you ever experienced,

1514
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
is because your body was there living

1515
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
with senses functioning.

1516
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So your experience can't remain standing

1517
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
without that body.

1518
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So the implements is not looking at the change,

1519
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
because change is just another experience.

1520
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The implements is recognizing that

1521
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
it's inaccessible.

1522
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The thing has a reason on its own,

1523
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
that body is there on its own, really.

1524
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You didn't have say,

1525
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
it's creation, it's manifestation,

1526
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
it's a sense, it's not anything.

1527
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You're just using it.

1528
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But you can only use it because

1529
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
it was already given beforehand,

1530
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and that's what impermanence means.

1531
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Ah, this using won't last forever.

1532
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Why? Because where these things came from

1533
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
is inconceivable to me.

1534
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I can't even imagine

1535
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
where and how the elements, whatever.

1536
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But you can't even access it.

1537
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Because of that, it's impermanent.

1538
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Not because, not because you can see it being destroyed.

1539
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
There is nothing to do with your body.

1540
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
We don't have to see that it is there,

1541
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
where the body or thought or whatever.

1542
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Only has to see, no need to see any change.

1543
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Only has to see that it is there.

1544
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Actually, you want to not see the change.

1545
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Because change is always on a more particular level,

1546
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
while thing remains the same on a more general level.

1547
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And that's what you want to start distinguishing.

1548
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Because for as long as you're going after change,

1549
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
your mind is going with it.

1550
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So you're not seeing the nature of that.

1551
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Because when the thing is changing,

1552
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
there has to be a degree of that thing standing the same.

1553
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And that's always on a more general level.

1554
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
That's why.

1555
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Well, it's always it ends like that.

1556
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Some, I think some, some, some, they don't have identification with the body.

1557
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But some would, just identify with the mental aggregates on it.

1558
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Well, I mean, theoretically, that's possible,

1559
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
but I said that.

1560
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,000
But I think now there is, it's more than a potential identity identified with the body and everything.

1561
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
If, if the potential was to have that much wisdom,

1562
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
to truly, truly abandon his body for what it is,

1563
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
with all of the instruction today and all the suitors

1564
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and coming across the dominant Buddhist teaching,

1565
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
he won't need much more to then discern the general nature of the mind

1566
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and any other phenomena as impermanent

1567
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
and not being able to hold his own self.

1568
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So most likely, the potential...

1569
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It's possible that 100% of the,

1570
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
never identify with the body for what it is.

1571
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Is it possible to do that?

1572
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Well, theoretically, it's possible, but it would still mean a lot of wisdom.

1573
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
But it's quite unlikely that the person today will develop so much wisdom

1574
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and not come across the Buddhist teaching to kind of get the final right tune of the right view.

1575
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:09,000
There is no different mental and bodily aggregates.

1576
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
The experiences are always experienced as well.

1577
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Your body wouldn't be known as your body,

1578
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
if it's not already appearing on a mental level.

1579
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Your thoughts wouldn't be known as your thoughts

1580
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
if your living body is not already there.

1581
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
So that distinction between body and mind,

1582
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
it's kind of unnecessary.

1583
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
What do you mean by resistance,

1584
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
the designation of something,

1585
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
you wrote in your book,

1586
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
what do you mean by resistance?

1587
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Well, it's what I was talking about,

1588
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
the four great elements, for example.

1589
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
They are what your body made of.

1590
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I just had a question.

1591
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Why is it used in sutra instead of for greater?

1592
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Why is this great?

1593
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Because they're so general.

1594
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So much in the background.

1595
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's the great.

1596
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Great.

1597
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
The great elements, yeah.

1598
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Mahabuddha.

1599
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Mahabuddha is the power.

1600
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And...

1601
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Your body being made out of those elements.

1602
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Again, as I said,

1603
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
your body is known as your body

1604
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
because it's still living there.

1605
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
You can download it.

1606
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Your body is known as such

1607
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
because the body is there as that

1608
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
because of which you can know that body.

1609
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Well, there is that

1610
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
a resisting aspect to that body,

1611
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
the aspect that you can't even access,

1612
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
you can't even comprehend.

1613
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Because of which your body is aging,

1614
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
subject to elements change,

1615
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
disappearance, destruction, and so on.

1616
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So it's that extent

1617
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
of that resistance that comes from these elements.

1618
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But that is upon which your whole experience is actually founded.

1619
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So you start to discern,

1620
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
you start to know

1621
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that you are fully depending upon something

1622
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
you can't even think of

1623
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and you can't even comprehend.

1624
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You just get the sense of it resisting you.

1625
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Hence resistance.

1626
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Resistance.

1627
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Means the resistance.

1628
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Means not being in your control.

1629
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Means you can't even conceive it to be in your control.

1630
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It's offering...

1631
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
That means your volition, your will, has its limits.

1632
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It can't reach its own foundations.

1633
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
They are resisting it.

1634
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
They are showing their own independence.

1635
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You can't even change.

1636
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You can't even think of it.

1637
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It is only for those who have served you.

1638
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
In a distance of 30 years.

1639
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Well, no.

1640
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
That's basically the four elements.

1641
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
They find the footing in the experience

1642
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
for as long as it is in or of the present.

1643
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So they are and can talk about resistance

1644
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but there is nothing resisting it or resisting him

1645
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
or resisting in it or out of it.

1646
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's just the four elements

1647
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
will remain sort of floating about

1648
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
for as long as the followers are there

1649
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and when he dies they are ticked.

1650
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
No more even because it's all talking about.

1651
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
For Arya again there is sort of a bit of both

1652
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
until all of the poison and toxins are cleared out.

1653
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But a putogenite would be me and then whenever he needs the resistance

1654
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
he would be resisting me, resisting in regard to me.

1655
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I am resisting it.

1656
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I am resisting in it or out of it or whatever.

1657
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It means trying to control it.

1658
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Trying to control it.

1659
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I was suffering.

1660
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yes.

1661
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
But you want to recognize just that the foundations of your experience

1662
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
are there which resist you

1663
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
because it can never even be taken up.

1664
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
You can't see directly the four great elements.

1665
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
They are always in the background.

1666
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
The four great elements as the foundation of this random body

1667
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
is just because what you see will be your perception

1668
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
and four great elements are determining your perception

1669
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
which means you can't ever access them with that perception.

1670
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You can only know that your perception is there because of

1671
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,000
that which resist out there that you can't even see.

1672
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Resistance and designation?

1673
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Well that's the designation.

1674
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Perception would be the designation.

1675
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
What you can perceive, you can talk about,

1676
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
you can designate, you can think it.

1677
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
But not that because of which that perception is there

1678
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
in the first place.

1679
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So that which resist is what's being designated.

1680
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:04,000
As that because of which designation is possible in the first place.

1681
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So this is all kind of a slightly more advanced way of saying

1682
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
that fundamentally things are completely out of your control,

1683
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
including your own sense of control.

1684
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Nobody is denying your sense of control.

1685
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Nobody is denying your sense of control.

1686
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
What you want to realize is that you can't own even that.

1687
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Why? Because it's fully found that which is completely out of your hands.

1688
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Self is always in regard to that sense of control.

1689
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So once you start recognizing that your own sense of control is enclosed

1690
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
with this whole thing that it's limiting you.

1691
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Then that you realize that well even this control that I can't access

1692
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
as modified things to an extent I can't know about.

1693
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's not permanent because when its foundations go, it will all go.

1694
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
But what's the raw concentration?

1695
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Because it's part of the eightfold path.

1696
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Concentration is the key more things together.

1697
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Like usually people think concentration is focusing hard on one point.

1698
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
No, it's finding the one point that includes everything else.

1699
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Not finding the one that excludes everything else.

1700
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Concentration means being fully established and steady in that background

1701
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
that I'm talking about.

1702
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
When you concentrate it is when your mind is settled in that background.

1703
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And no matter what actually you're doing,

1704
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
what things are attacking you, harassing you, coming your way,

1705
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
pleasing you, displeasing you.

1706
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
That concentration remains steady and I'm all alone.

1707
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And so the will always use those descriptions of unshakeable

1708
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
and so on and so forth.

1709
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So because it's fully established in this,

1710
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
so whatever it's coming, it still stays to your constant mind.

1711
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
It's concentrated.

1712
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So it's about taking everything like that.

1713
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
It's about becoming so established.

1714
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,000
It's about, well again, becoming so stepping back so much

1715
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
that you get really, really settled in that background.

1716
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So there is no concentration without mindfulness.

1717
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
If the concentration is about focusing and not seeing anything else,

1718
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
that's not concentration.

1719
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
The concentration of the sutras is the concentration where you're so mindful

1720
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
that even when you're not making effort to be mindful,

1721
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
you're still mindful of that.

1722
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But none of us said that no matter how far the puturjuna reflects

1723
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
that there's still an aspect of ignorance and that reflection.

1724
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yeah, which is why he has to take it on artificially

1725
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and start looking for what he reflects upon

1726
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
as in permanent, as suffering,

1727
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
and then as his experience is not.

1728
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
He doesn't see any of that.

1729
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Oh, so he starts emulating it from inside

1730
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and if he does it correctly and if it corresponds

1731
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
to the things the way they are,

1732
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
it will take the...

1733
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So if you refer to it as a graph,

1734
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
if they are on an alien graph,

1735
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and then it takes over eventually.

1736
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So then formal meditation,

1737
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I've done that so often like clamping up and trying to focus

1738
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
really hard on the body or the breath, but instead...

1739
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
No, just find your body as already there breathing.

1740
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1741
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And that's a very clear...

1742
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yeah, yeah, it's just there.

1743
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
You have to go grasp it or reach out for it.

1744
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And the mind will always inevitably be attending to something.

1745
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yeah, essentially it doesn't matter what it is.

1746
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah, in that sense.

1747
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Like if you're mindful of your body,

1748
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
you don't have to worry about...

1749
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
In that correct sense,

1750
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
if you find your body present there,

1751
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
you don't have to worry about what exactly you are thinking

1752
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
that second on a particular level,

1753
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
because you have to be thinking something.

1754
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And then being aware of thoughts,

1755
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
like when you're thinking,

1756
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
it takes a lot of your mental focus and energy,

1757
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
but you still have to add some reflection...

1758
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Well, again, like thinking.

1759
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You know, if mostly attention is gone,

1760
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
dedicated to whatever you're thinking about,

1761
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
still, you know you're there alive,

1762
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
this random body is still living and functioning.

1763
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yeah.

1764
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And that's the reason for you being able to think in the first place.

1765
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So having that little knowledge is enough,

1766
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
because no matter how much you're caught up in your thoughts,

1767
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
if this body is not there present,

1768
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
alive on its own completely indifferent to your thoughts,

1769
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
those thoughts are going to be there.

1770
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
They couldn't.

1771
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Inconservable.

1772
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Okay.

1773
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Sometimes I feel like,

1774
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I'm a monster,

1775
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
but sometimes, some of the automatic things are created

1776
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
and the interest of what you think,

1777
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
thoughts are very automatic reviews.

1778
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And sometimes it's just the only different.

1779
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Well, look, particular thoughts are reduced.

1780
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Thoughts are not reduced.

1781
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
They can just be in slower or whatever else,

1782
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
but it's not reduced because your particular thoughts

1783
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
about this might disappear,

1784
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
but the fact that you're aware of your experiences

1785
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
or your breathing means.

1786
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But you're thinking of that,

1787
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That's being thought.

1788
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So that's not in progress.

1789
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Suppose it's more time thinking about this bread.

1790
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Automatically it's become related.

1791
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
If it's just thinking about the bread only,

1792
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
it's not thinking much.

1793
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Well, you can think about the bread.

1794
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
For as long as you're still established mindfully

1795
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
upon the experiences, upon that background,

1796
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
upon your body breathing,

1797
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
and you're intending then bread.

1798
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But if you're just thinking what's right in front of you,

1799
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
you're trying to turn yourself into a robot,

1800
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
and it will not work.

1801
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Because you're not mindful.

1802
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
You're mindful only in reference to the background.

1803
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That's what mindfulness is.

1804
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
If you're just bringing things forward,

1805
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
that's not mindfulness.

1806
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Some people, when they just want to practice jhana, jhana.

1807
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
That's not jhana either, yeah.

1808
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Jhana is being fully established in that background.

1809
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
To the extent where the domain is,

1810
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
you step outside of the domain of centrality,

1811
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
the first jhana.

1812
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Then the domain of thought in the second jhana.

1813
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So you're not any more thinking about this thought,

1814
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
or that thought, means...

1815
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Yeah.

1816
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Means...

1817
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Yeah.

1818
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You're not thinking about this thought,

1819
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
the nature of thinking is there.

1820
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Nature of a thought.

1821
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And that's very, very general, as you can see,

1822
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
that it's just completely not specific,

1823
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
yet it's really such.

1824
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And that's what I mean when I say a background.

1825
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And that's the first jhana.

1826
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
The second jhana goes beyond that.

1827
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Goes beyond the domain of the nature of thought.

1828
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
In the civil war, doing the daily, daily activity,

1829
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
sometimes when I feel a little...

1830
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
like some day feel like there's so many,

1831
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
like too much thinking sometimes,

1832
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
so much of thought.

1833
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And if I just want to reduce that thought,

1834
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
then just...

1835
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Don't reduce the thought.

1836
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Reduce your emotional involvement with that thought.

1837
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
If you try interfering with your thoughts,

1838
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
you just try and you end up thinking more.

1839
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
That's not what.

1840
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So you'll be worse than before.

1841
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
But if you're mindful of your body

1842
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
being present there while you're thinking,

1843
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
it can give you enough space

1844
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
to know to be fully,

1845
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
completely immersed in whatever your mind is thinking.

1846
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And that's all, that's enough.

1847
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
You just have to be patient with that,

1848
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and it will be recognized as enough.

1849
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Why? Because no matter how hard your mind is working,

1850
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
for as long as you're not emotional disturbed,

1851
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
it's absolutely fine.

1852
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Even if it's horrible thoughts,

1853
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
even if it's thoughts that you don't want to have,

1854
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
emotionally you're not involved,

1855
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
that's your concern.

1856
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Because whatever thoughts ever is,

1857
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
and they will have to cease.

1858
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But if you try to interfere with them before,

1859
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
means, oh, well, you've taken

1860
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
then the main thought is yours.

1861
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
You think you have said

1862
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
in what you should be thinking, and so on.

1863
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
So you start interfering with it.

1864
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Sometimes I write a little contemplative.

1865
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Very well, it's like suffering arises.

1866
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
A lot of times I'm actually more like identification to you.

1867
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So then I hear any kind of suffering.

1868
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
No, the suffering, the suffering has a reason.

1869
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It means identification was there beforehand.

1870
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
That's already like a symptom of the underlying problem.

1871
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Are you bored?

1872
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
That's the symptom of the underlying problem.

1873
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It's not that that's when you're in the identification happens.

1874
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And you have to catch it or something like that.

1875
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So for you, in your mind,

1876
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
a lot of thoughts appear.

1877
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
No problem at all, right?

1878
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yes, your mind...

1879
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
They were never a problem, yeah?

1880
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
How do you...

1881
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
How do you still...

1882
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
What is a reason to cease?

1883
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
You contemplate on the individual.

1884
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Well, you just...

1885
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Again, you stop concerning yourself with a particular thought,

1886
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
unless there is a reason for it.

1887
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
You just recognize there is a nature of thinking.

1888
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You can go out if you want.

1889
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So there is a nature of thinking.

1890
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Thoughts are there.

1891
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It doesn't matter what thoughts.

1892
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Thoughts are there.

1893
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It means you're already mindful in regard to whatever you're thinking.

1894
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
You finish something stronger than fear.

1895
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Well, that's the thing.

1896
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So then you just endure it.

1897
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And then when the fear is gone,

1898
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
practice even harder in regard to things

1899
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
that are not too powerful and too overwhelming.

1900
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
That's how you develop strength.

1901
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
So then when the next time fear comes,

1902
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
well, it will be stronger.

1903
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So you'll be less affected by it.

1904
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
But at the time, you can't feel it.

1905
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Now the problem has to fix it.

1906
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Right now, right now, right now, you won't work.

1907
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Fixing it right here, right now,

1908
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
will be not interfering with it.

1909
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
That's the closest to fixing that you can get.

1910
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
This need to endure.

1911
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
For what is there?

1912
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Because you won't be there all the time.

1913
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And then next time,

1914
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
if you're not practicing hard enough,

1915
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
then you'll remember, well,

1916
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
there was that time when fear arose

1917
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and I didn't know how to escape that fear.

1918
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And it was very frightening and painful.

1919
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So I better practice now when there is no fear.

1920
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
So when the fear comes,

1921
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I'll be able to handle it and hold it

1922
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
without being moved by it.

1923
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So you use that as an incentive

1924
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
to make more effort.

1925
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
What the moment only has to endure.

1926
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
When the fear is there,

1927
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
you can sometimes, you know, the fear might be there.

1928
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And you still might be able to be mindful,

1929
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
but if it gets too much, then again,

1930
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
you can keep trying to be mindful,

1931
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
but bottom line is don't forget

1932
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
to endure and be patient.

1933
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
That's always the end basis.

1934
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
If everything else fails,

1935
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
well, at least I'll be able to endure it.

1936
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Why not?

1937
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Well, for 100, there's no contact with it.

1938
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Well, for 100, there is no endurance.

1939
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Yeah, there's no more fear.

1940
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Yeah, depending on how much toxins are left.

1941
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
More toxins, more endurance.

1942
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
More fear.

1943
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
More liability to fear,

1944
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
even if he doesn't necessarily experience it.

1945
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But I don't think

1946
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
even the possibility of fear is gone.

1947
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Not just that he doesn't experience any fear actually,

1948
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
but even the possibility of it cannot be...

1949
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
How do you still think you are very sick

1950
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
and you're also pain?

1951
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
How do you...

1952
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It's a discomfort,

1953
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
but it doesn't bring the fear

1954
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and it doesn't bring the mental suffering.

1955
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
How do you make the mindful decisions?

1956
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Well, you maintain it by developing it beforehand.

1957
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Before you can take it.

1958
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
That's why the Buddha urged monks and people.

1959
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Like, don't wait until it's too late.

1960
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Because there is a point when it's too late to practice.

1961
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
You haven't done enough.

1962
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Now it's just too late.

1963
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
If you spend your whole life not keeping the precepts,

1964
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
not really making the effort

1965
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
at the moment of it's too late,

1966
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
you can't expect nothing.

1967
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I've been all fixed in the last year of your life

1968
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
or something like that.

1969
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And every year might be your last year.

1970
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And if any time you might be too late already,

1971
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
or last year or not,

1972
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
that's why you kept bringing the sense of urgency

1973
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
in monks and people.

1974
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Well, practicing the egon during sickness

1975
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
will give you a peace for a year later.

1976
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah, you can't suffer now.

1977
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Like, suffering is when this comfort

1978
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
or this pleasure affects you mentally,

1979
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
causing you pain.

1980
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
No suffering means you can have

1981
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
even this comfort and this pleasure

1982
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
and not suffer on that account.

1983
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It doesn't affect you.

1984
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It's present, it's discomfortable,

1985
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
but it's not a reason for the pain.

1986
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Why? Because it never was.

1987
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It was always craving in regard to an experience

1988
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
that was the reason for your pain.

1989
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Now that craving is gone, there's no pain.

1990
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Even in the midst of this comfort,

1991
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
you can't possibly suffer.

1992
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
That doesn't mean you don't perceive the discomfort.

1993
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But you certainly don't feel the pain on the canvas.

1994
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Pupiner, when you had a fever,

1995
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
how would you feel?

1996
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Even so, but there was some sort of suffering.

1997
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

1998
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Because you still had lots of toxins left.

1999
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
So he was a sort of a doctor,

2000
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
but you still had a long way to go,

2001
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
but he couldn't go because he was so sick

2002
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
with medicines and everything else.

2003
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
He couldn't be making the effort,

2004
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
he couldn't be doing nothing, feeling sick,

2005
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
in pain and not being able to practice.

2006
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
So he thought, well, I might as well speed it up.

2007
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But, you know, sort of on a nose,

2008
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
he's a sort of on that.

2009
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So he had knocked out about that.

2010
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Well, a genuine sort of on a nose,

2011
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
he's a sort of on that.

2012
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Sometimes you have people who think they're on that.

2013
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That's what it would be.
