1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
I was here a few days ago listening to your Yamato, and now I try to break this, but

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:18,280
actually I struggle to apply, to seeing the context of the situation that pay for a background

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
to speak.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:27,280
It seems to me that what I do is like when I really remember the present moment, some kind

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,800
of impression, or so, whatever, thinking myself in the present, and then I try to

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,640
further into the context, but it seems more like intellectual exercise, like thinking

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,160
or talking to myself, okay, so I mean the situation, it is this problem which is given

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:51,120
to me, and talking like this, and I'm not sure that this is actually what I'm supposed

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
to do.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,120
Can you speak a little bit about this?

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Sure.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:04,640
If something is abstract or intellectual, that is determined by your attitude.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,360
Your attitude determines whether it's going to be abstracted from the present experience

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,520
or not, so if you know how to look properly, then nothing is abstract, then even turns

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,240
like the infinite space and either perception or perception becomes state that mind can

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,440
get established upon, because it's not divorced from it, I developed the knowledge of them

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,720
so you can get established in them.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,200
But yeah, for somebody who's absolutely no concept, no recognition of it, it will remain

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
abstract.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,760
So the point, like in simpler terms, for what you're trying to do, well first of all,

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,880
as I said, you can't force the background as a foreground, because I mean something

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,480
else is the background.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,720
So you can only just recognize whatever is the foreground at a time, and then while

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,800
the foreground is present, simultaneously with the present foreground, you start discerning

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,320
the background very fairly, in regard to that foreground, but not over-intending the

26
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
background.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,880
Not looking at the background directly, because then that becomes foreground, you just

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,440
attended it, which means then something else is very far out to your attention.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,360
That's why it's so hard, because you can't attend both ends simultaneously, that will

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,600
require you to step away from them.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,440
You can only attend one while the other is present.

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,320
That's why Nama Rupa returns to Vinyana when you look at Vinyana, when you look at Vinyana,

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,320
returns to Nama Rupa if you look at Nama Rupa.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,600
You can't look at them both and see them, yes, none of this is mine.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,440
So you can only learn while you're looking at Nama Rupa, for example, to discern the presence

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,240
of Vinyana in this sense, or just discern the background, without stopping, without

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,240
ceasing to look at Nama Rupa or whatever you're chosen to look at the time.

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,200
And that's how you develop knowledge about the peripheral, knowledge that that too is

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,800
determined by the foreground I'm looking in as much as the foreground is determined by

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,880
the background that is being generated by it, but you can't look at it to the same extent

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,320
and compare it to and say, okay, these both are mine, not self and so on and so forth.

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:15,600
So that's why it's so hard to, that's why it has to be repeated, on and on and on and

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,720
it's not like you're figuring it out intellectually, nor is it some sort of a mystical experience

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
where you just wait for some revelation.

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,600
It's just a mental drill, whereby you lock your mind literally to like a standstill for

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,160
a second, for a two, and you keep doing it, and you keep doing it, and you keep doing

47
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,600
it, until you start discerning, right, what's there in front of you?

48
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,200
But what you just said was that you're afraid you might become intellectual and sort of

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,680
not really, that's probably true in your case, because what, only three days ago you heard

50
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,560
about it, so you're going to take time to worry about, however, even if you're talking

51
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,160
to yourself, so to speak, it is slightly a crude manner of maintaining your mindfulness,

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,080
but you wouldn't be able to talk about things if they're not there.

53
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
I see.

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,880
So even you're talking to yourself is actually generated from the present situation, things

55
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,280
you're talking about.

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,520
So it's only a right that you then, that makes it kind of divorced from being remaining

57
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,960
rooted in the present situation.

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,840
So if you start talking to yourself present, you become mindful of what you're doing,

59
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,000
talking to yourself about these things, and you're not, and again, it's important to

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,560
say, it's important to stop expecting to find some sort of hidden kind of blitz of a

61
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,280
kind moment, oh yeah, I saw it, which is why people often expect that, well, they actually

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,480
take time to shake that off, because everything points at something like that, every meditation

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,080
technique, every practice, it's something you're going to see, no, it's not about seeing

64
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,520
it, it's about doing it.

65
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,280
And what you're doing apparently doesn't seem to have any result.

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,960
That's why people can't achieve it by accident.

67
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,120
That's why people can't develop their mind accidentally, because you might do it once

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,240
accidentally, or twice accidentally, or five times accidentally, but you see no apparent

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,160
verification, the putusion of what recognizes something worth pursuing, so you just think

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,600
of seeable that you would stick to it and keep repeating it all and all and all, unless

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,280
somebody a faith in tells you to do it.

72
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,320
And then you repeat it and you repeat nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

73
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,280
And then you look back and you realize, oh, actually, it's not nothing anymore.

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,080
My mind has changed.

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,760
And that's the similar that I've handled, how the work, the carpenter doesn't know how

76
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,280
much it has been wasted, but you just keep using it until it thins out, so just keep going.

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,240
You have to keep going and you have to keep in track with the patience, that kind of

78
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,160
expectation to, oh, I got it now, I had it, I had it for, I had it like for this second,

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
I did.

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,880
No, because the background remains, you just want to train how to start discerning it

81
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,320
as background, yes.

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,840
And if you start discerning it as background, as I said, you don't even need all these

83
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,560
suitors that we have, you'll need very few, and things will become clearer, because you

84
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,520
now have a basis for discerning it.

85
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,560
But if you pair, or that effort of discerning the background eye, effort of properly developing

86
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,160
mindfulness, if you pair that with bleeding the suitors and try investigating the meaning,

87
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,160
bleeding in the mirror, things like that that will make you think about it, then yeah,

88
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,880
you are basically making quite a problem.

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,280
Yes, I think you are nicely basically summarized the whole thing, yeah, that's what happened

90
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:45,120
to me that I was, you know, because it's something, you know, I was really expecting some unusual

91
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,480
things happening.

92
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:56,720
And, but Asric has said, it's kind of talking to myself and bringing it, am I not actually

93
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
bringing it to foreground?

94
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,800
Well, you are, that's the thing, so you might sort of talk to yourself as kind of picking

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,560
it up, but then you don't need to keep talking to yourself if it's still up.

96
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,320
That's when the suitors, when the monks who tried to understand something, they were kind

97
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,920
of, they say it's loud twice, so he's like, oh, first jauna, first jauna, what is first

98
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
jauna?

99
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,200
So they bring their mind kind of through that, after and through that designation, and

100
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,440
then the mind starts thinking about it, they don't keep saying, what's the first jauna,

101
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,280
what's the first jauna, what's the first jauna, what's the first jauna, because the mind

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,760
is directed, just like you're directed, and then you push it, so you obviously, that's

103
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,200
possible for somebody who's the other mind to that extent, then he can actually contemplate

104
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,200
on the basis of mindfulness.

105
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:45,320
So that's why it's sort of a practice really that's, as I said before, it's about doing

106
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:53,760
it, and that's again important to repeat, because if you focus on actually just repetition

107
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,600
and developing the attitude, then the content of the experience becomes secondary, it

108
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,640
comes irrelevant, then even if you have something, some lofty sort of sublime new experience,

109
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,600
now you're not fooled by it, you're not taken by it, you're not overwhelmed by it.

110
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Why?

111
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,320
Because whether it's a lofty experience, whether it's low, whether it's mundane, whether

112
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,040
it's upper mundane, whether it's normal, whether it's a novelty kind of rare experience,

113
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
experience is there.

114
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,440
It doesn't matter what it is, which means you stop being concerned with your content,

115
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,480
which means you can't create those things, you can't create the nature or experience

116
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,600
is present, it's kind of indifferent, it's neutral, and that's how you also overcome

117
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,800
any mystical attitudes for any sort of mystical, pleasurable revelations and so on.

118
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,760
The revelations you get are revelations of your insight that are based upon efforts to

119
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,120
understand and understanding being developed.

120
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,280
I think it's very nice to summarize because I was basically doing all these years, I was

121
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,360
just being caught up in experience, it never somehow influenced reading these sutas or

122
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,840
whatever, it never of, you know, and it's there actually, but it never occurred to me

123
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,800
actually to look on the structure of experience.

124
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,680
Because structure of the experience is nothing other than the same nature of experience.

125
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Yes.

126
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
And actually the Buddha said himself, that's what he called the whole teaching, he called

127
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,200
Dhamma in the same, using the same word, he uses for nature of particular things.

128
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,680
So it's Dhamma, Dhamma, with capital D, it's nothing other.

129
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:34,000
So then I'll understand what you are talking about, basically the past cannot be found

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
in the experience.

131
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,640
No, exactly, it's in regard to it.

132
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Yes.

133
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,040
Yeah, it's by understanding the nature of that which appears, the nature of the fact,

134
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,720
and it's in others that I mean in many sutas, it's said by understanding the nature of

135
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
the five aggregates.

136
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Yes.

137
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
There is no room for upadana anymore.

138
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Yes.

139
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
You stop holding them.

140
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
That's what it is.

141
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
But it really never...

142
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,880
Well, yes, as you can see, it is simple, once you kind of get the notion of it, it's

143
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,000
like, of course, it's not complex, it's not elaborate intellectually, it's very, very

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,880
concise and very direct, but unless you see it, you won't see it why, because even if

145
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,560
somebody talks about it, general about the nature, saying nature of experience is peripheral

146
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,840
of experience, it's nothing else.

147
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,840
But even if somebody talks about it, if a person doesn't have the attention they can

148
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,400
span to the actual and peripheral, simultaneously present, I, if he doesn't have the only some

149
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,200
monocicura, the one they can include it, you'll be just seeing is another method, is another

150
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,360
thing, is another technique, is another foreground thing that he cannot hear to mechanically

151
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
and it will lead into results, he won't.

152
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Yes, he won't.

153
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,600
So, you can kind of close the right instructions, but he won't read them rightly, he won't

154
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,560
understand them rightly, because he doesn't have, his mind doesn't have this span to recognize

155
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,640
that instruction applies simultaneously, but at different layers.

156
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,600
Yeah, yeah, you know me, I know you have two years or a day, so we already have two

157
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
discussions.

158
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,760
But just you listen, go actually, I just go at least, let's say slightly what you are

160
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,080
talking about before it relates.

161
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,760
In the whole, but it's no bother, for example, it first, exactly to that, to that simultaneous

162
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,640
presence of the two different sort of things in your experience, not to the same extent,

163
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,040
but the simultaneously present, one is foreground, one is better, now I'm looking at all of

164
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,680
the other, so it doesn't matter what a content of the foreground is, nor what a content

165
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,440
of the peripheral is, is nature of it, that's what the structure is, that's what it's

166
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
no bother.

167
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,720
So, you're going with it, with the grain of that nature, you go how it pushes you, you

168
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,600
go with the grain of Patissom Father, means ignorance is being maintained.

169
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,800
You go against that simultaneous sort of principle of that simultaneously present nature, you

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,960
go against Patissom Father, means ignorance is not generated anymore, so it's not, you

171
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,320
know, the content is relevant in a secondary sense initially, in terms of abstaining from

172
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,240
a wholesome content, an also engagement, things based on sensuality, ill will, but that's

173
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,120
just so that you can actually see through the nature of the content and then stop being

174
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,360
conservative, that's how our anger goes beyond good and bad, how people often like to

175
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:26,280
say, but so in that sense, you can transcend, you can sort of overcome any influence content

176
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:37,640
that can have over you, by understanding the nature of that, which contains that content.

177
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:44,400
So you just have to be sort of patient and really, keep sort of finding energy to do it, because

178
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,120
as I said, it's not, you know, you won't get any novelty sort of release energy, what

179
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,120
not, I don't know what people nowadays on the retreats, because it's really onto you

180
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,000
to develop it, and initially seemingly there is absolutely no, so that's why faith needs

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,520
to come first, you have faith that that's right, you try to also kind of supplement that

182
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,520
faith with any sort of intellectual clarity and understanding you can get in regard to

183
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,160
the message that you're supposed to be applying, and then you just keep doing it, keep doing

184
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,360
it and keep doing it and keep doing it.

185
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,960
But still, you can basically do your formal meditation, it's just about this little approach.

186
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Yeah, sure.

187
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:34,080
Just can you say, Pihika, Ana Pana, Satya, or Nuts of the Bodhi, in regards to that, like

188
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
this and that.

189
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Sure, sure.

190
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Yeah, that's fun.

191
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
That's fun.

192
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Because basically, you just, all you need to do is something that's not to distracting.

193
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Yes.

194
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,080
When you're walking up and down, but you just go for a walk, or following the alaqa, obviously,

195
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,520
you know, here you might be more concerned after a lot to look up for, but say like in

196
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,200
England, you could just go on those country lanes for a walk, you don't think about where

197
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,280
you're stepping in that sense, and then you can just fully commit to the reputation of

198
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
that contemplation.

199
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,000
Because you remain in the present moment of the bodhi, everything is already there, given

200
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
for you.

201
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,880
I think you need to work with, so you don't need to be sort of fabricating on top of

203
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,200
it and giving priority to some sort of focusing methods and things like that.

204
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,920
It's actually, as you can see, focusing works on particularizing whatever has a reason.

205
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,440
You don't want that.

206
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,720
You want to learn how to, like, see the general in regard to whatever it's already

207
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
particular.

208
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Yes.

209
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
So you basically go opposite way.

210
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,560
You don't want to be caught up in the experience and be completely lost.

211
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,800
Whether you have pain in your knees, weird sensations in your back, itchy elbows, what

212
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,760
is in common to all of those things?

213
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,480
The bodhi is there.

214
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
You recognize that.

215
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
And that's a thought.

216
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
It's nothing other than a thought.

217
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Yes.

218
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
It's a mental image.

219
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Yes.

220
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,320
But if a mental image, if you're mindful of it, it will stand for that big bodhi is in

221
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
your present experience.

222
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,440
If you lose mindfulness, it becomes an abstract thought of your body.

223
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,480
And then you need to kind of reconnect it to your mind.

224
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,640
No, you just need to be mindful of it again.

225
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,280
And it will sort of re-emerge as that which your body is.

226
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,880
Because you can't know anything without a mental image in your mind.

227
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Yes.

228
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
It's ritual.

229
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,080
It's, like, you can't even talk about something that will not exist without, because that's

230
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
already a mental image.

231
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Yes.

232
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
A phenomena.

233
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Yes.

234
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,040
So that's where you have to start recognizing things.

235
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,760
Not kind of following weird sort of itchiness and sensations in your body, because that kind

236
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,000
of seems like a solution because you actually forget about a problem.

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Exactly.

238
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Exactly.

239
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Exactly.

240
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Exactly.

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,240
And the thing is, sooner or later, depending on how much effort you put in, you're going

242
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,840
to get used to it in a particular way of looking at things that are focusing and then

243
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,960
novelty and the release of that novelty kind of a new thing, it's a new discovery, it's

244
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
going to fail.

245
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Yes.

246
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,240
So then you need to do it harder or find something else, or go on a longer retreat, or become

247
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,080
even stricter, be personal, practitioner or whatnot, just to intensify further or more.

248
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,200
But you just keep going further and further and further in that wrong direction.

249
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Yes.

250
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,680
This is an infrastructure.

251
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,240
And that's how in the soup, as you can have somebody understand, just even without any

252
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,680
of that, just by his word, because understanding is in that general level.

253
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,040
So if he understands things right, he leads to the nature, he might not necessarily be

254
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,440
mindful, obviously he's had a mindfulness for some degree, for the mind to remain present

255
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,160
and compose, some sort of somebody, for him to see things clearly through that understanding

256
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
and through that instruction.

257
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,320
So that's where the somethings they would just discuss, the Dharma and mind would end

258
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,000
with somebody based on the discussion, based on some sort of, you know, sharing of the

259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,800
mutual energy that's kind of passes from me to you, you know, just understanding the

260
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,000
same setup, the same structure, the results in mind, reaching in equilibrium.

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:54,840
So can we still define mindfulness as a values of the present or among the experience?

262
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,480
Yes, but mindfulness sort of should allow a degree of forgetfulness as well, of the present

263
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
moment.

264
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,280
So it's not just like a constant and present, and present, and present, and present,

265
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,320
because whether you do a present, even when you're forgetting is in the present moment.

266
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,760
So you want to discern that, that's how mindfulness becomes unshakable, whereby when you forget

267
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,120
things and come back from it, the base is, it remains unaffected, because whether you

268
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,840
forget, you forget in the present moment, whether you think about the past, you think in

269
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,480
the present moment, where you plan about the future, you plan in the present moment.

270
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,880
So actually, it's not optional for you, you are stuck in the present moment.

271
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Yes.

272
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,720
So the definition of that, but people don't recognize that they try to fabricate it with

273
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,720
a effort and with a forceful attention, a present, a present, a present, a present, one,

274
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,040
two, three, four, five, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, one, two, no.

275
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,280
Your present means things are already enduring, so it's the discerning of those three characteristics,

276
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,640
rising in mindfulness, sitting in mindfulness, position of changing in mindfulness, mindfulness

277
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
is established.

278
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Yes, absolutely.

279
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,000
No, by active effort, because you're already there, your effort is done present here.

280
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes.

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,800
Whether I want or not I'm in the present moment, fully understanding that, that cannot be,

282
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,760
that cannot be disturbed, even when you, when you forget about things.

283
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,800
And then when forgetting and remembering, ceases to sort of induce ignorance in a sense

284
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,240
of you forget the things in you, you forget, that you are not a center of experience,

285
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,120
you forget the things don't really need you for they're operating, the five-hour-day

286
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,200
things exist, what, without you really, if you forget those things, then when you remember

287
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,000
you remember with yourself, you remember with your craving, you remember with your conceit.

288
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,480
So that's why the mindfulness needs to be developed to the extent necessary.

289
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,520
So the knowledge of forgetfulness and non-forgetfulness needs to be developed to the extent necessary

290
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,880
to include both, so the neither will induce the confusion from beforehand.

291
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Yes.

292
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Yes.

293
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:59,320
So also it seems that basically thinking or thought is just, it can be used as another,

294
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
let's say, object.

295
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Absolutely.

296
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,080
You know, it's in the same, but still seems to mean that the body is actually better.

297
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Well, you have to start.

298
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,960
I think starting with the mind will be too, too hard, you know, as the Buddha said, to

299
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,000
general can, you know, understand the nature of the body and even this, remove any passion

300
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,080
in regards to it, but understand the impermanence of the mind and so on, it's too hard, because

301
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,400
it moves too quickly.

302
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,080
But it's the same principle, it's the same nature.

303
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Yes.

304
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
So you don't want to start with the body because energies are hidden in the body and

305
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
you're going to release some trapped ignorance that's somewhere in the body.

306
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,560
No, you start just because it's easier to see, but you do extrapolate the same principle

307
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,720
and start applying it to your thoughts, because ultimately it's the thoughts actually.

308
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,680
If you want to deal with something, they will deal with both your mind and your body,

309
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,600
you need to deal with your thoughts, but it's too hard.

310
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
So you begin with the obvious thoughts of your body, so that you can start seeing the

311
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,080
nature of thoughts.

312
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,880
So then thoughts of your mind, thoughts in the mind, thoughts that are not necessarily

313
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,080
concerned with the body, that can also be included through understanding the same nature

314
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,480
of a thought.

315
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Yes.

316
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,360
And do you have access to body always through the mind?

317
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,640
So yes, that's not the question kind of already implies a certain answer.

318
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
The body is there.

319
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:26,160
The only way you can have the experience of the body is because of the mind, which means

320
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,400
the mind is then cannot be separated from the body.

321
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Yes.

322
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,360
But the body, when you can't even say the body, if the mind is not already there, so in

323
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,400
that sense the mind comes first, it defines it, it designates it, yet if there is nothing

324
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,200
there, the mind would not be able to designate anything.

325
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,400
That's why there is the form rupa that is necessary for the whole presence of nama and

326
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
that designation.

327
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Yes.

328
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
So there needs what?

329
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
There needs…

330
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Yes.

331
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,040
The problem is now, I see when I said there is rupa, when you think that thought there

332
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,720
is rupa, you think that's the actual rupa, but no, that's just another nama in regard

333
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,800
to that, because of which that nama is there.

334
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Yes.

335
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,240
So you have… that's how you start conceiving the rupa in the experience, when the thoughts

336
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,840
in regard to rupa are regarded as that which rupa is.

337
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,000
So if you experience rupa, if you experience body, it's not the body.

338
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,240
Well, no, you know that's a problem already, now you're denying rupa, which is another

339
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,400
form of affirming it.

340
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,600
Like basically he conceives form, he conceives in form, he conceives apart from, no, it's

341
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,440
not the body, it's the body, it's not the body, it's both the body and not the body,

342
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,560
it's neither body nor not the body, either way he keeps referring to the body, which he

343
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,480
still means, means basically still assumes that he can relate to that which body is eye,

344
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,040
he can relate to that rupa, but thinking that you can relate to that rupa, you already

345
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,800
conceived it as relatable.

346
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,280
So you must visit it very thoroughly, what you are talking about.

347
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Exactly, you can't get it in a moment, because that's already the product of your conceiving

348
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
or misconceiving.

349
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,760
So you need to understand the peripheralism whereby in thinking there is just thinking, in

350
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,440
seeing there is just seeing in her, there is just her eye, there is not too much or too

351
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,120
little of it, there is not given to the rupa or taking away from it, it's just fully understood

352
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:25,080
that this thought stands upon the basis that rupa is, but even that thought does not for

353
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,440
you induce assumption that that's what that rupa is, because that one, basically that would

354
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,560
be overshooting the mark, there will be like you accessing that which you cannot access.

355
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,320
And by not knowing that you cannot access, you access it, and that's how you maintain

356
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,600
its existence, that's how a rupa finds a footing in your experience, you create it, you

357
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
give it, you maintain it.

358
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Very good, very good.

359
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
But I'm glad it's clear.

360
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:57,600
And what I have, another thing, you know, I lost the, you know, I lost the, I lost the

361
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:09,040
point, that I have the point, now it's okay, let's see, my comeback, so we have to think

362
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:24,360
about it, to think, to continue in her thoughts, to find experience, oh gosh, that's a question.

363
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:38,880
Coming back to the structure of experience, what I, now, we have this three characteristic,

364
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,160
and what I got from you is basically that, the understanding of them comes, all of them,

365
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,280
it's not like a sequence, because I was thinking that you must, by understanding Anichar,

366
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,520
to ask the little car, and then you go to the next one to understand, no, no, no, it's

367
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,120
one insight that you can develop, it has these three characteristics, so you might not

368
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,200
necessarily be equally discerning all the characteristics, but you see them all, to

369
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,000
some extent, hence the insight is there, it's same with the four normal truths, it's

370
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,440
just four aspects of the one thing, not like one, and then you go to second, and then

371
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,480
after a few days you reach the third, no, it's basically just four ways of laying out every

372
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,400
aspect of that one insight, which is freedom from suffering, the one who is free from suffering

373
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,800
knows what the suffering is, if he doesn't know what the suffering is, he wouldn't be

374
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,440
able to be free from it, he knows how that suffering arises, he knows how that suffering

375
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,800
came to be, he knows how that suffering ceases, and he knows what he needs to do, and that's

376
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,480
all in one insight, but if you want to teach that one insight to somebody, this is the

377
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,320
ultimate way, the most accurate precise way to lay it out, as for aspects they need

378
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,960
to be covered, that's why I forgot, when he breaks it down to free, you need to develop

379
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:12,620
free, and the kind of four normal truths become like 12 parts of steps, so to speak, where

380
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:19,840
every truth needs to be developed fully, so you realize to understand, so you have the

381
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:28,160
four aspects, if you fully develop four aspects, and each aspect can be developed threefold,

382
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,280
and then you get 12, so in that sense you get 4 and 12, but it's not like one, two, three,

383
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,360
four, five, it's just one insight, it's describing four, and each of those describing three

384
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,680
other ones, two people, whose mind can discern that far, but ultimately all you understand

385
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:51,280
is arising of suffering and freedom from it, which is again, in order to be free from

386
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,180
suffering, you need to recognize the suffering as a reason, and as a phenomenon you have

387
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:03,100
to recognize it for what it is, but some aspect can be more prominent, can be, what sure,

388
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,980
you might be clear in some aspects, but that means basically there is still some ignorance

389
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,740
left in regards to it, so if you fully develop all four aspects, you'll be an arant, which

390
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,260
means Arya does not have all four aspects fully developed, he has them to some extent,

391
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:24,020
but he has them, he has the four normal truths, and are they necessary, yes, yes, yes,

392
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,020
well no, that's just an approach, that's just an approach, yes, the one that do the four

393
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,860
aspects become arant, no, it's not necessary in a sense, you have to, as I said, it's not,

394
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,740
it's not a fixed method, it's just one goal, as I would have said, you only teach your

395
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,500
suffering in freedom from it, as the ocean has only, does it taste the salt, no matter where

396
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,140
it is, so he's teaching freedom from suffering, that's it, so no matter what approach you

397
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,540
take, no matter through what suit you arrive at understanding, no matter how different

398
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,260
you might sound, those are not all methods you have to cover, they all point at the same

399
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,780
thing, so if you arrive at the same thing, that's all it matters, so if somebody arrives

400
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,580
at the same thing to the contemplation of the nature of suffering, craving in regard

401
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,940
to it and so on, then he becomes free from suffering, he becomes an arant, he full of it,

402
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,940
that's it, if somebody, you know, with a different mind arrives during the standing of this

403
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,620
single tennis principle, which is a particular part of the actual emperor, he becomes free

404
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,060
from suffering, it's the same result, that's why sometimes, that's when he never meant

405
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,180
that sometimes even people with the right view might actually hesitate if they were to

406
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,540
distract but teach his own father as twelve factors, because it's a subtle thing to see,

407
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,020
and they might have arrived differently at the freedom from suffering, and then they

408
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,820
never thought of a teachable father in that relevant manner, they thought it all, it's

409
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,900
with some explanation and they don't care about it, why, because they arrived at freedom

410
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,540
from suffering through some completely different approach, again, from the suitors, that's

411
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,900
why they have arhands with like different extents of the wisdom, some have arrived only through

412
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,580
like a single kind of approach, they've really committed to it, had faith in, some arrived

413
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,340
through discernment of many different approaches that kind of brought mind to fulfillment, and

414
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,260
their wisdom, basically wisdom is great, that's why they can teach better, they can understand

415
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:07,700
better, but not all of them can, but some of them can only teach in the manner that

416
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,180
they reached, but it doesn't mean that they are less, because the Buddha said it doesn't

417
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,220
matter how you reach it, or how why you have to circle in order to reach it, the point

418
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:23,740
is to reach it, so that's why the faith type, the wisdom type and the kind of meditation

419
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,460
sort of translation, meditation type, one through samadhi, none of them is better than the

420
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,420
other, the one who is the best is the one who becomes an arhand, and then you can come

421
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,500
an arhand on the base, do these three things, so it's not like, oh, he's a better arhand

422
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,340
because he arrived through wisdom, and then he's a worse arhand because he arrived through

423
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:53,500
faith, no, both are arhands, that's all it matters, yeah, they're good, and they're also

424
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,940
talking about this anichar, can you say it again, what is actually anichar?

425
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:09,900
Again, because it would be hard to undo the notion of material sort of scientific impermanence

426
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,020
because people say it's impermanent, they expect its destruction, and they often use that

427
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,500
as a proof of impermanent, once something has been destroyed, you say it has truly

428
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,340
looked up, these things are all impermanent, but you not just that that doesn't make any

429
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,340
any kind of relevant sense for the freedom of the sense of self, but also you can't even

430
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,860
apply it in that sense because it would require you to kill yourself, to destroy yourself,

431
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,380
to see yourself as not yourself, so in order to see or not self, you need actually you

432
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:45,580
require the phenomenon of self, to see it as not belonging to you, but if you destroy

433
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:51,300
it, even before you see it, means you completely sort of, well, you entirely, just entirely

434
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,500
block your own problem, you can't possibly remove any basis for discernment of that particular

435
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:05,500
thing, so you should really think anichar, as I said, it's a kind of wide basis, like

436
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,700
in Sanskrit, it means everlasting, but even the definition by the way of permanent, if

437
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,780
you look at English definitions, that means lasting until it comes to an end, so it has

438
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:23,100
permanent presence until it disappears, so the whole ocean of eternal gets kind of creeps

439
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,620
into that sense of self and then, oh, eternal, non-internal, and so on, but even that can

440
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,300
be too abstract for people, so the more practical level, if you want to look at anichar, means

441
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:39,820
basically out of your control, that which is present but cannot be owned, cannot be truly

442
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:46,420
in your possession, in your mastery, and you recognize everything accesses that degree

443
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:51,300
of resistance, to some degree, everything accesses resistance to some degree to you, which

444
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:57,940
means everything shares the nature of anichar to you, and it's that varying degrees of

445
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,180
anichar that confuse people in thinking that things that are kind of accesses in less

446
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,780
of an independence kind of resistance attitude towards you, you confuse them as yours, because

447
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:15,420
it's resisting you less, but it's not a question of not resisting you at all, it's just

448
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:22,060
a question of basically things are impermanent and less impermanent, but they're still impermanent.

449
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,380
In other words, things are out of your control, some of them more so, some of them less so,

450
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,900
but fundamentally none of them is fully in your control, and that's all it takes just

451
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:38,500
to recognize that then, oh, so then this whole motion of self, there is the notion of

452
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,820
absolute control, there is a self cannot be based upon partial control, if self recognizes

453
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,980
partial control elsewhere, means it's taking full control somewhere else, that's why

454
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,140
it's established upon, so you might dismiss everything saying, oh no, this is mine because

455
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,780
I don't control it, but maybe that very thought is something you think you control, so

456
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,900
you send the self remains and then getting to that, so that's why you need to include

457
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,260
a peripheral of the general nature whereby you kind of scoop it all up and then discern

458
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,900
it within that, because if you keep chasing where yourself is established you won't find

459
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:16,060
it, because it's always going to slip to the next thing, so again, a nature as that

460
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:22,780
sounds like the nature also as one of the meaning is there an internal, personal, personal,

461
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,500
so contemplate the nature of personal, take something that you always is personal, if

462
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,260
you were to say that, what do you refer to, but what do I refer to personal, and you

463
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,660
would see kind of fuel to describe it phenomenologically, that experience, you would be referring

464
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:42,700
to something that's close, almost inside, in relation to the outside, it's something

465
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:48,740
right here, so that's why it's personal, that's why you took possession of it, that's

466
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,180
why you guard it, that's why you kind of shelter it, but if you recognize that none of

467
00:32:54,180 --> 00:33:00,380
the things can be personal in that sense, that's how you discern it, and that's what

468
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,700
any change, but recognizing that none of that can be personal, that any of that can

469
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:11,900
come to an end at any time, and you recognize that while the thing is still present, that's

470
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:17,100
how you sort of, while you recognize danger, you're holding onto something that will sort

471
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,660
of pull you to death because of you holding, not because you have to die, just because

472
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,980
you're gripping onto it, so you recognize that all of these things that I hold there,

473
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,460
for that very reason, just for that very reason, can't be a result of my demise, and that's

474
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,940
very dangerous, but at the same time it becomes very liberating, recognizing that because

475
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,980
then you let go of it, so even if you keep surrounding the video possessions and stuff,

476
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,620
none of them will be regarded on that personal level, so if something happens, if you lose

477
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:51,540
your house, if you lose this, if you lose your friend, that's it, the mind will not be

478
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:57,420
affected, you won't be shattered by that, because it has withdrawn, recalled away from it,

479
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,860
before it disappeared, before it took you away, and that's what any change is, that's

480
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,900
where, again, automatically by recognizing an issue, properly, you recognize that suffering

481
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,740
in it, just for that reason, not because you might be a very good thing, might be a very

482
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,260
happy thing, family, children, all that, by automatically simultaneously better, by

483
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,780
recognizing suffering, you don't regard that as dear, you don't regard it as personal,

484
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,300
you don't regard that as mine, you cannot possibly, because in order to have that attitude

485
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:33,580
of mine, that lingering notion of mine belonging to me, you need to see as personal, you need

486
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:41,420
to see it as dear, you need to see as worthy, as pleasure, as non-painterous, so can you

487
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:52,140
say that actually, you know, what you consider to be self is not yourself, if I summarize

488
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:57,380
the whole point, so the only point is just, so, to summarize it more accurately, but you

489
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:03,780
can see that, that which you take to be yourself, is a real thing, that's what I want to

490
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:09,100
ask, you just have to remove your sense of ownership in regard to that notion, yes, so

491
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,300
that notion is still basically there, but you don't consider it, but you can't see that

492
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,180
notion directly, that's why this whole point of training your mind in peripheral recognition,

493
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,980
that's how you start including that vague notion of self, that vague notion of ownership,

494
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,860
that vague notion of master external to this, you start including into that peripheral

495
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:35,260
that you see it's present while the actual has a reason, so if the mind becomes established

496
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:41,580
in that peripheral, you realize self never appears as a direct object, because it wouldn't

497
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,220
be the self, which means in order to tackle the self, you need to see the self, you need

498
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,500
to see the phenomenon yourself, in order to see the phenomenon yourself, you need to learn

499
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,580
how to see an ambiguous phenomena, as ambiguous phenomena, not over define it into that which

500
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:03,860
you expect it to be, but basically see how it has a reason, it's kind of weird, kind of

501
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:10,660
hard to decide, put in world, hard to put a finger on, notion sense of self, of master,

502
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,820
that might have kind of a memory of your face attached to it, or something like that,

503
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,980
but anyway, it's a sort of ambiguous phenomena, the nevertheless is present as such, so

504
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,780
learning how to see peripheral, you learn how to recognize this phenomena for what

505
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,700
they are, so then when you see there's that peripheral, you don't need to feel it, you

506
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,940
don't make it actually, you don't redefine it, you don't need to destroy it, or you need

507
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,980
to stop regarding it as yours, and then utter becomes un-attacked, that's it, this self

508
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,220
becomes not self, it doesn't become no self, like there was never self, no there was,

509
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:47,420
if there was never self, you would not have the self, so it's just a mistake of ownership,

510
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,220
that's when you never said when a person disappears, but to a general, when they sent

511
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,780
out of either disappears individual remains, so that vague general notion basically might

512
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,740
remain, but it won't be regarded as this supreme master of experience, and above all,

513
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,260
it won't be regarded as independent of the five aggregates, it won't be regarded as

514
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,540
an independent of the experience as a whole, actual and peripheral, it will be seen as

515
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:17,820
just the basically sort of kind of unnatural, natural center of actual and peripheral

516
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:24,580
of the tensorism on its own, that's when individuals vary, individuals are different,

517
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:35,260
some people sort of are, like Arahans vary, they don't turn into the same identical blank

518
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:42,660
five aggregates, different individual, different preferences, different notions and so on,

519
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,460
but there is no assumption in regard to the individual, assumption of ownership, assumption

520
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,020
of self, and then obviously assumption of the self view as a completely independent sense

521
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,020
of self, completely independent of any of the five aggregates, it's sort of a manager

522
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:09,620
and master of them externally, ties in together nicely when you're speaking from the

523
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,460
same thing, it's the same thing, it's not like many different sort of all, wow, that's

524
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:20,140
really clever, no, it's just one thing, explaining millions of different ways by the same thing,

525
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:29,500
the same point, the same principle, the same image, so to speak, yes, yes, yes, yes,

526
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:35,900
but you want basically see that that point is not just like object of your thinking, but

527
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,900
it's pointing to the structure of the idea, is that clear, is that clear, yeah, that's

528
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:47,580
very basic way, from other questions, yeah, because if it's, if it's just an objective

529
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,740
thinking, that means everything else underneath it is completely left untouched, you cannot

530
00:38:51,740 --> 00:39:21,580
never reach the end of the suffering if you just make it another object, yeah, exactly, yes,
