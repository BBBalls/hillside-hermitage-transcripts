WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:41.920
So I have a few suitors that I would like to go through and this theme is really about

00:41.920 --> 00:55.360
sense of restraint and the Buddha gave a short teaching to Bahia, he gave a short teaching

00:55.360 --> 01:08.560
to Malonkia Buddha, the same, the same verse. So I'll just read out Janabhira's translation

01:08.560 --> 01:17.640
of this. Okay, then by here you should train, train thus, in the scene there shall be just

01:17.640 --> 01:22.440
the scene, in the herd, there shall be just the herd, in a sense there shall be just

01:22.440 --> 01:28.720
the sense, in the cognize there shall be just the cognize, thus by here should you train

01:28.720 --> 01:36.720
yourself. When by here for you in the scene there shall be just the scene, the herd,

01:36.720 --> 01:45.320
just the sense, just the cognize, then you will not be that by which, when you shall not

01:45.320 --> 01:52.480
be that by which, then you shall not be in that place, when you shall not be in that place,

01:52.480 --> 01:58.660
then you will be, you will neither be here nor yonder, nor between the two, just this

01:58.660 --> 02:14.260
is the ending of suffering. So when he says you will not be that by which, you will not

02:14.260 --> 02:20.880
be in that place, and you will not be here, or yonder, or between the two. So I think

02:20.880 --> 02:30.400
here yonder and between the two, what is that, you know, here is the sense basis. Yes,

02:30.400 --> 02:36.400
yeah, yeah. You will need to be your sense basis. Well, you neither, your self will neither

02:36.400 --> 02:43.120
be taken to be your sense basis, or sense objects, or both, or neither, whichever you

02:43.120 --> 02:48.840
think, something you can through denial of things, you can establish your sense of self.

02:48.840 --> 02:55.840
So you can deny, like, there is here, there is yonder, and in between the two, would

02:55.840 --> 03:01.720
stand basically for both here and yonder, and neither here nor yonder. The mental attitude

03:01.720 --> 03:06.680
in regard to the experience of the whole of here and yonder, because the self can always

03:06.680 --> 03:13.320
kind of, even through denial of it, can reestablish itself as not that, but implying I am something

03:13.320 --> 03:19.040
else. Although there isn't anything else to be found simply through that denial, negation

03:19.040 --> 03:25.480
of something, you give enough space for the notion of self to remain. So in that sense,

03:25.480 --> 03:35.880
basically, when in seeing that is just the scene, no amount of movement, so to speak, of

03:35.880 --> 03:43.040
the mind in regard to the high and the sights in the experience of the scene, no amount of

03:43.040 --> 03:48.480
the movement, whether it's in it, a parchment, both in it or a parchment, whether it's

03:48.480 --> 03:53.960
mind, whether it's for me, whether it's this, none of that will induce the sense of self.

03:53.960 --> 04:00.160
When in seeing, there is just the scene, or in other words, when the scene is not appropriate,

04:00.160 --> 04:06.120
and the senses that are seen are not appropriate. When both, the senses in that which is being

04:06.120 --> 04:11.720
seen are not appropriate. Then, in the scene, there is just the scene. So when you're neither

04:11.720 --> 04:20.240
appropriating it, and appropriation is basically established either through indulging it or

04:20.240 --> 04:30.320
running away from it, indulging it or denying it, either way, you basically relate to it.

04:30.320 --> 04:36.600
So to speak, and that relation is a form of appropriation. So that's why he doesn't,

04:36.600 --> 04:42.280
he doesn't either indulge the sights, nor does he fear them or run away from them. The

04:42.280 --> 04:50.240
scene is just a scene. There is no need to do anything in regard to it, for and haven't.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.520
Because you have a pleasing sight or a displeasing sight.

04:53.520 --> 05:00.280
Exactly. And so he. Pleasing sight is just a pleasing sight. For somebody who is not

05:00.280 --> 05:05.960
developed in regard to pleasing sight, pleasing sight would be inducing last in their mind.

05:05.960 --> 05:10.000
The last is not in the pleasing sight. That's what the Buddha said. That's one other

05:10.000 --> 05:14.520
of Nianavira's translation, in the back of the book, saying that the target that perceives

05:14.520 --> 05:19.520
beautiful objects in the world. He still sees, oh, this is beautiful, this is agreeable,

05:19.520 --> 05:27.360
this is nice. But he, his thoughts do not have desire and lust in regard to those things.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.040
But it's when people can't see that, can't see that the nature of desire and lust

05:31.040 --> 05:38.960
pertains to the mind, it's not in the objects, then they deny the objects. They try to overcome

05:38.960 --> 05:42.960
the desire and lust through sheer denial of objects. And that's the suit that the similar

05:42.960 --> 05:51.240
of the, the bait in Majimonika, where, sure, one day, her eats Mara's bait, I enjoy the

05:51.240 --> 05:58.440
sense of scale. And then, and then because of that, Mara does with them what he wants.

05:58.440 --> 06:03.800
Then another group of their sees that, sees that the hunter controls this there, does

06:03.800 --> 06:09.880
what he wants, because they're eating their traps and wearing it. Then they think, okay,

06:09.880 --> 06:13.840
like in, in, in, in, completely similar range to the big ones, and the big ones would

06:13.840 --> 06:21.880
see, okay, so indulgence of the sense of objects leads to, like, us being slaves to Mara.

06:21.880 --> 06:29.800
So then, they deny the entire sense of fear. And in that suit that says the deer, then

06:29.800 --> 06:35.680
shuns the bait completely, forgetting that they do depend on it to some extent. They

06:35.680 --> 06:40.520
shun it, they go up in the mountains, but then sooner or later, the food, the water runs

06:40.520 --> 06:44.000
out in the mountains, and they have to come back to that bait. And because they were never

06:44.000 --> 06:48.360
developed in regard to the bait in the first place, they end up eating it, carelessly,

06:48.360 --> 06:53.120
like the first deer here. And again, in the end, Mara does with them what he wants. It's

06:53.120 --> 07:00.760
exactly like the indulgence and denial results in the same, results in you not being, not

07:00.760 --> 07:06.760
understanding the nature of the bait and being controlled because of that. So the point

07:06.760 --> 07:15.680
is that the deer would recognize that, if he would recognize the nature of the indulgence,

07:15.680 --> 07:21.440
the nature of denial, and then it would stay within the domain of bait, because it depends

07:21.440 --> 07:26.960
on a certain extent to it, it depends on the food, but it would not eat carelessly. And

07:26.960 --> 07:34.320
that's the key. It could eat carefully, it would be careful of the bait. So he wouldn't

07:34.320 --> 07:38.880
deny everything, he wouldn't throw away the baby with the bathwater, it would basically

07:38.880 --> 07:45.280
start distinguishing. And that's a very, well, it's not necessarily subtle, it reminds

07:45.280 --> 07:49.360
of getting used to it, but for most people, it's a very subtle distinction because people

07:49.360 --> 07:56.880
either say yes or no completely. And then obviously, you have to start with restraint first,

07:56.880 --> 08:07.160
restraint in regard to things that are not necessary, such as sexual integrals, things

08:07.160 --> 08:15.840
based on excessive lust, things based on anger and so on, but then eating food is necessary.

08:15.840 --> 08:21.960
But you can do it lustfully, you can do it because of craving, or you can do it mindfully.

08:21.960 --> 08:28.160
But people who don't know, who can't distinguish that the lust is on them, not on the food,

08:28.160 --> 08:31.440
then they start denying food, they try going food, and this is exactly what's happening,

08:31.440 --> 08:37.200
a setisism, self-mortification, then that will sooner or later, that won't be enough.

08:37.200 --> 08:41.960
Then they start denying more, then it can go as far as denying breeding, denying air, denying

08:41.960 --> 08:48.120
anything. And the Buddha tried that and he said, no, this is not the way. Now that doesn't

08:48.120 --> 08:53.040
mean that, okay, so now you should go back and eat everything unwarily again and be completely

08:53.040 --> 09:00.600
unrestrained, that's as serious as it can be. But the Buddha was quite clear how one should

09:00.600 --> 09:05.000
then practice. So you develop the virtue first, you develop the strain, you stop doing all

09:05.000 --> 09:09.600
some things that are completely unnecessary and they have like inexcusable. But then other

09:09.600 --> 09:18.680
things, you can't help by encountering agreeable sights, agreeable sounds. So if you're just

09:18.680 --> 09:23.680
blaming sights and sounds, well the Buddha again said, you won't be different than a blind

09:23.680 --> 09:27.840
or a deaf man. If you think that the domain of sight, the medicine is a problem, it's

09:27.840 --> 09:33.400
not. His desire and lust in regard to it. So instead of being the second ear that runs

09:33.400 --> 09:38.880
to the mountain in fear of the whole domain, no, you recognize that, so you stay within

09:38.880 --> 09:43.880
it. Practice restraint to the extent necessary. But then for the rest, you start developing

09:43.880 --> 09:49.640
mind from a sin regard to it. That means eating the food carefully, not being careless in

09:49.640 --> 09:54.080
regard to the bait. Because that's what the bait is, carelessness. That's what gives

09:54.080 --> 09:58.800
rise to lust, to aversion, to delusion. It's not the actual food, it's not the actual

09:58.800 --> 10:08.800
sense objects. No matter how agreeable they are. What was the other quote you just said?

10:08.800 --> 10:12.480
They don't want to do that out of our video. Well they didn't know, because it's exactly

10:12.480 --> 10:22.200
what I'm saying. Just before that, what you're saying now, because to shun the bait seems

10:22.200 --> 10:28.720
to me, it's a very, well it's a very, some sort of evil will be. Oh yeah, of course.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.760
You're pushing away. Yeah. It's aversion. Your aversion. Yeah. You're averse towards

10:32.760 --> 10:38.000
that. Out of fear. Because you fear that agreeable sight sounds, melt taste, that will induce

10:38.000 --> 10:42.160
lust, because you absolutely don't know, nor equals to prevent it, because you don't

10:42.160 --> 10:46.400
understand it. But do it. So the only way that you know how to get

10:46.400 --> 10:52.840
pushed things away is to be able to, well, you push away pleasing things, and then you bring

10:52.840 --> 10:57.920
the things that displease you closer. So then that becomes that which pleases you. So

10:57.920 --> 11:05.560
end up just acting in the same way, like the first herd. Because that other herd, they

11:05.560 --> 11:12.400
see what the hunter's about, they see what the bait's about, and they've overcome it.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.720
He's kind of bewildered by the bait. They stay there, but they don't need the bait, so

11:15.720 --> 11:22.320
he can't see them, because they're never caught on the hooks. But the food is eaten around

11:22.320 --> 11:25.960
the bait. But is there really a bait with the hunter

11:25.960 --> 11:35.960
really exists in illusion? Yes, it's much. That is the case. That's the situation you're

11:35.960 --> 11:39.360
born in. The hunt, the ground for hunting you in there. Oh yeah, that's all the gosh

11:39.360 --> 11:43.360
people can deny. It's all sorts of views and stuff, which is of course, that's why the

11:43.360 --> 11:46.880
acknowledgement of those things has to come first. But when we are talking about, we assume

11:46.880 --> 11:55.640
that we agree on that. So it's a different topic now. We agree that there is such thing

11:55.640 --> 12:13.560
as being controlled by the senses and being a victim to it. So this is another sutra from

12:13.560 --> 12:28.040
Saint Utanikaya, and chapter 35 verse 94. It's called untamed or unguarded. So the Buddha

12:28.040 --> 12:35.000
is speaking, because these six bases for contact, if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained,

12:35.000 --> 12:48.280
unbringers of suffering. Just six because of the basis for contact, where one unrestrained

12:48.280 --> 12:53.520
meets with suffering, those who know how to restrain them, well uncorupted, with faith

12:53.520 --> 13:01.240
their partner. Having seen forms at delight the mind and having seen those that give no

13:01.240 --> 13:08.240
delight to spell the path of lust towards the delightful and do not soil the mind by thinking

13:08.240 --> 13:14.940
the other is displeasing to me. So they have been seeing the delightful. It doesn't say

13:14.940 --> 13:21.360
run away from delightful. Cover your eyes from delightful. It says, dispel the lust in

13:21.360 --> 13:29.640
regard to delightful. Having seen a non-delightful, don't end up thinking about how non-delight

13:29.640 --> 13:40.080
I don't end up developing a version in regard to non-delightful, mental version, but it

13:40.080 --> 13:47.000
doesn't say run away from non-delightful, because that is the way out. That means you're

13:47.000 --> 13:50.440
blaming non-delightful and you're blaming the lightful for your lust and for your

13:50.440 --> 14:05.000
lust. You're not seeing it where it is, but not seeing it where it is you cannot possibly

14:05.000 --> 14:10.240
have rooted. Having heard sounds both pleasant and noisy, do not be enthralled by pleasant

14:10.240 --> 14:15.400
sound to spell the cause of hate towards the noise, do not soil the mind by thinking

14:15.400 --> 14:23.040
this one is displeasing to me. Having smelt a fragrant delightful scent and having smelt

14:23.040 --> 14:29.920
a putrid stench, to spell a virgin towards the stench and do not yield to desire for

14:29.920 --> 14:37.160
the lovely. Having enjoyed a sweet delicious taste and having sometimes tasted what is

14:37.160 --> 14:44.400
bitter, do not greedily enjoy the sweet taste, do not feel a version towards the bitter.

14:44.400 --> 14:53.280
So if you can't be clearer than that, yet many people blame the taste. Do not greedily

14:53.280 --> 14:57.840
enjoy the sweet taste. Don't be greed in regard to, it doesn't mean don't ever eat

14:57.840 --> 15:06.160
sweet, agreeable taste. No, if you're generally equanimous in regard to the taste, it doesn't

15:06.160 --> 15:11.680
matter if it's agreeable or disagreeable. It means if you're generally equanimous you

15:11.680 --> 15:17.960
won't be running away from agreeable cause you fear that it will induce the last. No,

15:17.960 --> 15:25.560
equanimity is basically absence of last to understanding. So removing of greed in regard

15:25.560 --> 15:31.680
to the agreeable, in regard to delicious, having enjoyed delicious sweet taste. So you

15:31.680 --> 15:37.840
can even enjoy it in a way without being greedy about it. Why? Cause it's agreeable, that's

15:37.840 --> 15:44.560
a form of enjoyment. And that's just the fact. The sense enjoys it. You don't necessarily

15:44.560 --> 15:49.000
enjoy it. And that's obvious that many people don't enjoy it because they fear it. And

15:49.000 --> 15:52.720
that's a mistake. So you let the sense enjoy it, why? Because you have to eat. But you

15:52.720 --> 15:57.800
don't do it unwarily, you don't do it carelessly because that will then induce greed in your

15:57.800 --> 16:02.440
mind. And then you will be appropriate in sense that enjoys it. But you can't enjoy

16:02.440 --> 16:10.200
the taste even if you want to. You always pertains to the like that physical sense, presence

16:10.200 --> 16:18.480
of the matter that is your tongue. So the fact that you think that you can enjoy it and

16:18.480 --> 16:22.400
then you deny it through running away, through practicing extreme asceticism, through not

16:22.400 --> 16:29.880
eating because you fear the taste basically. You are fully appropriating your sense base

16:29.880 --> 16:35.080
and then protecting it because you can't let go of it. The hunt is chasing you. You've

16:35.080 --> 16:41.480
been chased. You're running away. You can't sort of... Well, no, yeah. I mean, in the sense

16:41.480 --> 16:49.320
you can't run away because you're holding onto the bait. Yeah, you're not eating it because

16:49.320 --> 16:53.880
you're fearing it, but you're holding onto it. Which is amounts to the same thing. You're

16:53.880 --> 16:59.160
hooked by the bait one way or the other. Are they treating it carelessly or through holding

16:59.160 --> 17:07.160
it tightly out of fear? We're saying as well. And you can never see that actually you can't

17:07.160 --> 17:11.040
even enjoy the taste even if you want to. The sense will enjoy the taste for as long as

17:11.040 --> 17:17.800
you deny it. For as long as you deny agreeable taste. So you know for fact that you're restrained.

17:17.800 --> 17:22.080
You know for fact that you eat once a day. You know for fact that you're not seeking out

17:22.080 --> 17:28.480
for a pleasant taste. And then you encounter a pleasant taste. And feeling that is just

17:28.480 --> 17:34.080
basically completely like a wisdom. Running away from it, it's even further like a wisdom.

17:34.080 --> 17:38.600
Trying to prevent it, trying to not feel it with your tongue or whatever. It's just playing

17:38.600 --> 17:48.520
ridiculous. Because those objects of the senses are for the senses in their domain. It's

17:48.520 --> 17:52.160
their business kind of. Exactly. So whatever they get. The file animals, they have

17:52.160 --> 17:58.320
feeding grounds. It's not. I mean, you will be affected by it when you appropriate that

17:58.320 --> 18:02.680
feeding ground, when you appropriate that animal the feeding. When you are, when your mind

18:02.680 --> 18:08.160
is inseparable from your tongue, when your tongue is appropriated, when your eyes are appropriated,

18:08.160 --> 18:13.680
you will be well, you will be affected by what you see, what you taste and so on. And running

18:13.680 --> 18:16.680
away from it, it's just another form of being affected by it.

18:16.680 --> 18:26.800
Because no matter what comes into the eye, so to speak, where would you see the eyes?

18:26.800 --> 18:31.440
Yes. So then in the scene, there is a scene and then you will not be dead by which. And

18:31.440 --> 18:36.200
that's what it means. Being dead by which in another sutra, when another says, it's

18:36.200 --> 18:41.880
the eye, eye, as the organ makes you dead by which you are the conceiver. You are the

18:41.880 --> 18:47.920
one who sees the things, thus you end up conceiving them as mine. So because you just automatically

18:47.920 --> 18:53.200
appropriated the sense-basis, because they don't appear as objects. They are always

18:53.200 --> 18:57.880
negative in regard to it, which means they are even harder to see. They have to be seen

18:57.880 --> 19:01.840
as a negative phenomenon. And because of them, most people don't see it. And because of

19:01.840 --> 19:06.680
that, because of their appropriation of their sense-basis, in this case, let's say,

19:06.680 --> 19:14.480
eyes, they are the seer of the eye objects, because they just descended down into the eye.

19:14.480 --> 19:22.240
They took them. So now what I see means I see that. What tongue-tastes aren't tasting

19:22.240 --> 19:27.640
that. And that's what they mean, they're being dead by which. But if seen, there is just

19:27.640 --> 19:32.920
a scene in taste, there is just a taste. They will not be dead by which. But they're not

19:32.920 --> 19:37.240
dead by which. They don't appropriate the sense organs. Well, they will not be in the

19:37.240 --> 19:42.280
objects. Whether they are not properly in the sense organs, nor are they found in the

19:42.280 --> 19:47.640
objects, they will not be here, nor yonder, nor between the two. No behind in front.

19:47.640 --> 19:52.440
No behind in front, above, left or right. They will simply not be room for the sense

19:52.440 --> 20:00.040
of self. Because sense of self can authorize without the basis, which is appropriation regarding

20:00.040 --> 20:06.240
things as mine. But that's completely prevented, through understanding that it's impossible

20:06.240 --> 20:11.120
to be there in the first place. You can't all those things in the first place. So you

20:11.120 --> 20:14.600
prevent the appropriation means there is no room for sense of self. You don't even think,

20:14.600 --> 20:18.720
oh, now I have to practice the non-self. Not that experience or non-appropriation is the

20:18.720 --> 20:20.960
experience of non-self.

20:20.960 --> 20:30.960
You take like there's the sum of those animals and the senses as the animals. So the dog

20:30.960 --> 20:38.280
is eating its food. But if you, you can never have that food that the dog is eating because

20:38.280 --> 20:41.720
you're not, you're not the dog. You're not the dog, yeah. So even if you thought you were

20:41.720 --> 20:49.680
holding onto the dog and thinking that you are eating this food, whatever it is, that's,

20:49.680 --> 20:53.360
you can't get any of that stuff. So you're going to be suffering constantly.

20:53.360 --> 20:59.360
Well, think of it like this basically. The only way for you to eat the food is for tongue,

20:59.360 --> 21:05.560
mouth, digestive organ to engage with the food. And all of those things, if you look at

21:05.560 --> 21:13.720
them independently, so to speak, are independent of you. Your mouth, your organ, it's not in your

21:13.720 --> 21:18.320
control. Those things have a reason and they correspond, well, they have objects that

21:18.320 --> 21:24.040
correspond to it, they engage with it. So not recognizing the impermanence of the sense

21:24.040 --> 21:28.200
basis, for example, you're appropriately automatic.

21:28.200 --> 21:33.440
Yeah, the similar of the animals doesn't quite work in this sense because you can always

21:33.440 --> 21:40.080
well, nothing stops you from eating dog food. The thing is, the five animals, but basically

21:40.080 --> 21:46.400
you know the domains because of them. You can't, you can't have, you cannot have relationship

21:46.400 --> 21:53.400
with sight without the eyes, which means basically all you can have relationship with, it is,

21:53.400 --> 22:01.640
all you can have relationship with is eyes seeing things. You can't access sights unless

22:01.640 --> 22:07.880
I see them first. So you can't even have the idea, you can't even mentally think about

22:07.880 --> 22:15.440
sights without applying eyes. But if you don't appropriate your eye, then your eye is going

22:15.440 --> 22:19.920
to just look at it. It's going to be on your strength.

22:19.920 --> 22:23.920
Exactly, that's what people think, exactly. So they think, oh, so I must let go of my eyes,

22:23.920 --> 22:29.600
which means, but no, you're still, you are responsible for your strength. So once you

22:29.600 --> 22:34.120
start restraining and the precepts are quite clear, where the five, where the eight, where

22:34.120 --> 22:39.800
the ten, no matter how many, they are quite clear. And that's what you decide beforehand.

22:39.800 --> 22:46.800
And then you start seeing the negative phenomenon of the eye, eye object. Sorry, eye base, eye

22:46.800 --> 22:51.440
bases, the sense bases of the eyes. And then you recognize, okay, so it's still within

22:51.440 --> 22:56.840
that strength. So if you were now to make the jump from non-appropriation of the eye to

22:56.840 --> 23:02.200
a non-restraint of the eye, that would have to be a conscious jump. That can't happen

23:02.200 --> 23:08.960
by accident. Why? Because eyes stopped engaging in an awesome, fully, un-awesome thing through

23:08.960 --> 23:15.000
setting up the seal at first. So now you can genuinely let go of the eyes. Why? Because

23:15.000 --> 23:18.360
they won't go into that awesome. Because they used to go into an awesome, only because

23:18.360 --> 23:26.960
you were sending them there. That's why the Buddha said you can't possibly engage in sensuality

23:26.960 --> 23:36.120
without having fully established sensual perceptions. And for that, you're fully responsible. And

23:36.120 --> 23:41.640
that cannot be done without appropriation of the eyes. So quite the opposite from what

23:41.640 --> 23:49.440
people believe, genuinely letting go, genuinely not appropriating the eye base, fully prevents

23:49.440 --> 23:59.240
even a possibility of sensual engagement. Because that is intentional, once the eyes have

23:59.240 --> 24:06.400
been taken as mine, then you relish the pleasure that you fully feel you can access. And that's

24:06.400 --> 24:11.560
the whole point of sensuality. That's the whole nature of it. You feel you are in touch

24:11.560 --> 24:16.640
with your disagreeable objects, either through consuming them through your mouth, through

24:16.640 --> 24:21.000
your eyes, through your nose, through grasping them with your hands. It's exactly what sensuality

24:21.000 --> 24:28.040
is consumption. And you can only assume that you can consume things when you have appropriated

24:28.040 --> 24:35.040
the bases. There are the only ones that can access them. But even then, all you are consuming

24:35.040 --> 24:43.080
that you are consuming are the sense bases that then, on their own external kind of level,

24:43.080 --> 24:48.240
correspond to these sensuality and interact with them. So you can never actually access the

24:48.240 --> 24:54.560
sights. All you can have is, all you can see, so to speak, is eye-seeing things.

24:54.560 --> 24:59.080
Exactly. So all you can have is your sense base being affected by these things, but you

24:59.080 --> 25:05.120
can't access those things. So you can't actually taste the food. You can taste your tongue

25:05.120 --> 25:11.520
tasting the food. You can't touch things. You can experience your body being touched

25:11.520 --> 25:15.640
by things or your body touching things. In other words, it's always indirect. You can

25:15.640 --> 25:21.000
never bypass the body as a sense of touch or bypass the tongue and go straight to the

25:21.000 --> 25:27.440
sense objects. Which means, the sense objects are kind of always determined by your sense

25:27.440 --> 25:31.200
base. Because if your eyes are not seeing certain colors, that's it. You can't even

25:31.200 --> 25:35.400
consume those colors. You can't even consume. You're only like in some, like, maybe external

25:35.400 --> 25:39.240
communication, I get the idea. You're seeing things differently, but for you, that is what

25:39.240 --> 25:44.240
you see. That is the real thing. Which means you can only access sensors that are being

25:44.240 --> 25:50.680
affected by external objects, by external magic. And that recognition already approves any

25:50.680 --> 25:56.360
desire you can have for central engagements with those external objects, by, because

25:56.360 --> 26:00.680
they're inaccessible. No matter how hard you press, how hard you squeeze, how hard you

26:00.680 --> 26:06.280
taste, how hard you look, or you know, you're fully understood. You can't doubt it anymore.

26:06.280 --> 26:11.040
That all you're seeing is your eye seeing. All you're tasting is your tongue tasting. All

26:11.040 --> 26:18.120
you're touching is your body touching. So it's always an indirect. An indirect man. Like

26:18.120 --> 26:22.360
you can't turn away, turn back and look at the things. The only way you can see them

26:22.360 --> 26:29.840
is by having a mirror in front of him. That's your way of looking back. And in this

26:29.840 --> 26:35.440
simulate, looking back is basically the sense objects. There are there in the world, inaccessible.

26:35.440 --> 26:41.360
The only way to access them is when they're reflected upon the sense base. When they engage,

26:41.360 --> 26:48.360
they're corresponding engagement with the sense base. Then you see it. How it corresponded

26:48.360 --> 26:52.720
to it. But it still doesn't mean you're actually accessing the matter of the sense objects,

26:52.720 --> 26:57.280
impossible. They will require you to come out of all of your sense bases and it goes straight

26:57.280 --> 27:01.960
to the matter. But that is inconceivable. Because even that thought is based on a complete

27:01.960 --> 27:15.960
experience of sense bases, even in the imaginary basic, even in the imagination. In a 7 out of

27:15.960 --> 27:24.960
6 animals. 5. A 6 out of 5. Comment what they are, crocodile. Crocodile monkey, yeah.

27:24.960 --> 27:31.960
It's 5 animals and then the mind base their meat in the mind. Like the 5 senses in the

27:31.960 --> 27:39.760
mind. Because it's the monkey. He says the monkey mind. I don't know. They pull to their

27:39.760 --> 27:45.000
own feeding grounds and the thing is he's got a rope tied. He ties the rope in the middle

27:45.000 --> 27:49.960
and then they just pull. I know that was ever the strongest. That's where everyone

27:49.960 --> 27:56.960
has got it. Because they're tied to the same meal. So everyone goes with the crocodile

27:56.960 --> 28:00.960
or whatever. And then he doesn't just tie it in the middle. He tied it to a post and

28:00.960 --> 28:05.960
that's discernment. That's mindfulness. And then they get tied. They stop pulling

28:05.960 --> 28:10.960
it. So they can't actually go there because they tie it. See that similarly. You don't

28:10.960 --> 28:14.960
tie it in the middle together because then the strongest will pull. That's basically

28:14.960 --> 28:23.960
when people use a certain sense to overcome other senses. See unpleasant sights sound

28:23.960 --> 28:28.960
abothering you. But then your mind just goes start thinking about a pleasant taste.

28:28.960 --> 28:33.960
You're bothered by unpleasant touch, unpleasant taste. But then you like the beautiful

28:33.960 --> 28:38.960
instance and then you're enjoying the pleasant smell and your mind comes down because of that.

28:38.960 --> 28:43.960
Or sometimes admiring the beautiful view as a form of meditation. Which is as

28:43.960 --> 28:49.960
mistaken as it can be. Because that's exactly it. Ah, this sense seems calmer than

28:49.960 --> 28:52.960
the others. So you use that sense to overcome the others. But in that sense,

28:52.960 --> 28:56.960
when that sense changes, you will be pulled and all the other senses will go for it.

28:56.960 --> 29:00.960
Because this is the strongest among them. So I don't really recommend that way.

29:00.960 --> 29:04.960
That's why you must not use any sense as a basis for a meditation because that's

29:04.960 --> 29:09.960
not meditation. And the Buddha did say that actually. Like a jackal waiting for

29:09.960 --> 29:14.960
a mouse or an owl waiting for a prey, praying upon a fish. Like waiting hunting,

29:14.960 --> 29:19.960
hunting, waiting, grabbing the moment, waiting, waiting, waiting. So the misguided person

29:19.960 --> 29:24.960
overmeditates, undermeditates, mismeditates, premeditates, but he doesn't

29:24.960 --> 29:30.960
meditate. And basically, when they miss the point of meditation, they end up

29:30.960 --> 29:34.960
meditating with the mind revolving on centrality. And revolving on centrality means

29:34.960 --> 29:41.960
revolving around dependence on a sense, for pleasure, for pain, for peace.

29:41.960 --> 29:46.960
Yes, there was nothing pleasing in a sight, nothing pleasing in a smell,

29:46.960 --> 29:51.960
no taste, no sight. It's a pleasing sight. But there is no greed for the pleasure

29:51.960 --> 29:54.960
of that sight. It's just a pleasing sight. But if there's no pleasing,

29:54.960 --> 29:59.960
but there's a, the only way you can get pleasure is to say your body.

29:59.960 --> 30:06.960
Right, right, right. Then you would go comfort. You would go to the physical comfort.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.960
There's no physical comfort that you go fences about the sight, or even just

30:09.960 --> 30:13.960
going to your imagination. It's kind of a reproduction of the other senses in

30:13.960 --> 30:18.960
their peaceful state, in the state of not being gained by their hunger or

30:18.960 --> 30:24.960
whatever else. But it's again, revolves around them.

30:24.960 --> 30:32.960
So, everyone's got to, well, suppose everyone's going climb to certain

30:32.960 --> 30:37.960
senses. Yeah, exactly. From the front of each other, or some people have issues

30:37.960 --> 30:42.960
with food restraints and so on. Or music, you have to listen to it.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.960
Oh, yeah, that's another thing that people listen to music as a form of meditation.

30:45.960 --> 30:51.960
That's exactly what I was describing here. It's, it's after, after the

30:51.960 --> 30:59.960
limous guide. When touched by a pleasant contact,

30:59.960 --> 31:04.960
and do not be enthralled, do not tremble when touched by paint.

31:04.960 --> 31:09.960
Look evenly on both the pleasant and the painful, not drawn or repiled by

31:09.960 --> 31:17.960
anything. To me, that touch is quite a, it's very inside, you know,

31:17.960 --> 31:24.960
it's so close. It's quite a, to be able to look evenly on both

31:24.960 --> 31:29.960
pleasant and painful touch.

31:29.960 --> 31:38.960
Not have your mind swayed by it, by the prospect of comfort,

31:38.960 --> 31:44.960
by the possibility of discomfort, fanophysical kind.

31:44.960 --> 31:49.960
Being swayed means not, not, not, not craving it.

31:49.960 --> 31:54.960
And not running away from it. Why? Because it wasn't

31:54.960 --> 31:58.960
able to begin with. Why are you running away from it?

31:58.960 --> 32:02.960
Why are you trying to avoid it? You trying to avoid it means basically

32:02.960 --> 32:07.960
you're still regarding it as you are. The sense basis,

32:07.960 --> 32:11.960
you're trying to avoid things that correspond to your sense base.

32:11.960 --> 32:16.960
So you're trying to avoid comfort or discomfort depending on your view.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.960
But you will only be committed to avoiding it because you fool

32:19.960 --> 32:25.960
the appropriate in this body. Instead of letting go of the body,

32:25.960 --> 32:30.960
relinquishing any notion of appropriation,

32:30.960 --> 32:34.960
then sometimes comfort, sometimes discomfort.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.960
The mind doesn't, it doesn't get swayed, doesn't get affected.

32:38.960 --> 32:43.960
Because as you can feel your whole body, your whole body is touched.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.960
So it's not appropriate, you know.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.960
See, that's the thing, you can't run away from that.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.960
Yeah, you can't.

32:54.960 --> 32:59.960
That's why mindfulness in the body plays such a fundamental.

32:59.960 --> 33:03.960
Because of that, and because all the other senses are basically bodily,

33:03.960 --> 33:08.960
so eluded, contained in this very body.

33:08.960 --> 33:13.960
So if you stop appropriating the body as a sense base in its entirety,

33:13.960 --> 33:17.960
there's a sixth sense base, then you won't be appropriating

33:17.960 --> 33:21.960
sight, sense, notay, stutters, or thoughts and energies.

33:21.960 --> 33:26.960
You won't be appropriating anything physically or mentally.

33:26.960 --> 33:31.960
And if you're not appropriated, you don't run away from it.

33:31.960 --> 33:35.960
Because disagreeable was not yours to begin with.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.960
And even if there is any response to agreeable,

33:37.960 --> 33:39.960
it's a bodily response.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.960
It's a response of the sense base that you don't appropriate,

33:42.960 --> 33:44.960
which means it's only a limited response.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.960
It can never be a response with lust,

33:46.960 --> 33:48.960
a response with aversion, a response with delusion,

33:48.960 --> 33:53.960
because they're all intentional responses, responses for which

33:53.960 --> 34:02.960
you and your misappropriation of things was responsible for.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.960
You continue further the same, Sutta.

34:05.960 --> 34:09.960
When common people have proliferated perception,

34:09.960 --> 34:12.960
to see even proliferate, they become engaged.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.960
Having dispelled every mind state bound to the home life,

34:16.960 --> 34:20.960
one travels on the road of renunciation.

34:20.960 --> 34:26.960
When the mind is lust, well developed in six, these six phases.

34:26.960 --> 34:30.960
If touched, one's mind never flutters anyway,

34:30.960 --> 34:33.960
having vanquished both lust and hate,

34:33.960 --> 34:38.960
because go to the far shore beyond birth and death.

34:38.960 --> 34:47.960
So this is another suit of mine after its 95th millennium.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.960
A great monk was a great name.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.960
And he goes to quite old apparently, at the stage in the...

34:56.960 --> 35:00.960
I think I remember him from my journey, he was a Sutta fan.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.960
Yeah, he was a Lenin.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.960
No, he was a Lenin.

35:04.960 --> 35:09.960
There was a Sutta fan, he was asking whether I'll come so that my mind can sometimes also be affected

35:09.960 --> 35:13.960
by I'm also a steady forget about that mind, so on.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.960
Oh yeah, there, also.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.960
But maybe there was a different one than him, you know.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.960
I don't know if it was a dip, yeah, but the same name.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.960
The same name, yeah.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.960
So he asked the Buddha for a short.

35:25.960 --> 35:29.960
You might say that you might, a short discourse or a short message.

35:29.960 --> 35:34.960
So you might dwell alone withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.960
So the Buddha goes on to say, questions.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.960
What do you think Melunkiya Buddha?

35:51.960 --> 35:58.960
Do you have any desire, lust or affection for those forms cognizable by the eye that you have not seen or never saw before?

35:58.960 --> 36:03.960
That you do not see and would not think might be seen.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.960
Yes.

36:06.960 --> 36:17.960
Do you have any desire, lust or affection for those touches cognizable by the body that you haven't, have not touched you and never been touched by before?

36:17.960 --> 36:24.960
And you do not touch now and would not touch you.

36:24.960 --> 36:29.960
Is this no veneration?

36:29.960 --> 36:39.960
It's impossible to have lust for things that have never, for sites that have never been seen.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.960
They will never be seen.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.960
You can't possibly imagine them.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.960
Because why? Because they have never been seen.

36:46.960 --> 36:53.960
So you can't have lust for that, for that which has an arisen.

36:53.960 --> 37:01.960
You can't have lust for that which has not left an imprint on a sense space.

37:01.960 --> 37:15.960
So to speak, figuratively speaking doesn't actually have an imprint, but you can't have lust for that.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.960
It's inconceivable.

37:17.960 --> 37:21.960
And it's similar what I was saying before.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.960
So you recognize that.

37:23.960 --> 37:31.960
Then if you see that basically it's impossible to lust or have aversion towards site that has never been seen, never will be seen.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.960
You can't even imagine seeing.

37:34.960 --> 37:43.960
Then you recognize that sites that you did see, that you will see are completely circumstantial.

37:43.960 --> 37:50.960
They are far more inferior to all of the things that you haven't seen.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
What? Because they were seen.

37:52.960 --> 38:02.960
Which means it's always like things that are seen always arise on a basis of great things that haven't been seen.

38:02.960 --> 38:09.960
So then you realize that even your lust is completely gratuitous and unnecessary and pathetic.

38:09.960 --> 38:20.960
Because you're lasting this sight that was completely random and circumstantial and easily could have not been.

38:20.960 --> 38:21.960
There's a big change.

38:21.960 --> 38:28.960
So if you recognize that in whatever you're experiencing that this could have not been, it is but could have not been.

38:28.960 --> 38:33.960
And the fact that it could have not been precedes the fact that it is.

38:33.960 --> 38:39.960
It means it's completely circumstantial thus it was never for me. It could have never been for me.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.960
And it certainly never be for me.

38:42.960 --> 38:50.960
Because that being for me, the mind, it's already like makes it special, it gives it priority.

38:50.960 --> 38:51.960
It makes it more important.

38:51.960 --> 38:58.960
But if something is circumstantial, it could have not been between it and it won't be.

38:58.960 --> 39:03.960
Something else will come its place. And then when that does, that could have also not been.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.960
And you can't have lust for things that have never been.

39:06.960 --> 39:15.960
Thus, when you do have lust for things that are, that's just on top of that completely gratuitous on top of that circumstantial arising.

39:15.960 --> 39:24.960
So just through recognizing that you can't have lust for things that have never reason, you can actually bang on lust for things that have.

39:24.960 --> 39:30.960
By seeing the circumstantial nature, which is nothing other than saying by seeing a reason things as a permanent.

39:30.960 --> 39:39.960
And if permanent means impossible to home, means basically subject to cessation, subject to cessation.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.960
Doesn't mean you actually witnessing the cessation.

39:42.960 --> 39:47.960
You just recognize it. This is circumstantial, which means you have no idea where it came from.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.960
And because of that, it will cease.

39:50.960 --> 39:54.960
Even if you keep witnessing it for the rest of your life, it still remains permanent.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.960
That covers everything that might be seen.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.960
It covers all the possibilities as well, exactly.

39:59.960 --> 40:05.960
Because whatever might be seen, it's going to be seen on a circumstantial basis.

40:05.960 --> 40:11.960
And as a danger, if you don't cover it, if you don't know that, the danger is...

40:11.960 --> 40:17.960
You'll have things unincluded basically in this direction, yeah?

40:17.960 --> 40:25.960
It's like a couple, I say, a man and a woman get together, they love each other.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.960
Infatuated with each other.

40:28.960 --> 40:36.960
But he's seen her, but he might see someone else tomorrow.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.960
There might be even more desire.

40:38.960 --> 40:42.960
And he can't stop that from happening.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.960
He can shout off his eyes, but then...

40:44.960 --> 40:50.960
Yeah, because you never practice restraint. You got the things he sees, things he touches, things he desires.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
And then he loses interest in his wife.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.960
Exactly. He just moves on to another.

40:54.960 --> 41:00.960
But if he were to see that even the first one was completely circumstantial,

41:00.960 --> 41:05.960
he would have... well, he would have been able to control his desire, if not completely abandoning.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.960
There's a reason for abandoning.

41:07.960 --> 41:12.960
But what I'm saying is that even a lay person, not necessarily a man who is practicing for our hardship,

41:12.960 --> 41:20.960
a lay person who is in union with the opposite sex, can use this reflection to remain faithful,

41:20.960 --> 41:24.960
to remain restrained, to remain but to the other wisdom.

41:24.960 --> 41:29.960
There's that sort of a couple, the man and woman, came to the Buddha.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.960
And they asked him how to...

41:32.960 --> 41:35.960
I think they might both have the right view.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.960
And the Buddha...

41:37.960 --> 41:39.960
How do you...

41:39.960 --> 41:43.960
Well, I'm not sure if it was that sort of how to really go together, but he was basically sort of a...

41:43.960 --> 41:48.960
He says, oh, yeah, they practice like perfect, they're perfectly faithful to each other.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.960
He's like, not just, they've never...

41:50.960 --> 41:54.960
Like, the husband says, not just that he never cheated on the wife,

41:54.960 --> 41:59.960
but he also never, never like verbally was unfaithful to her.

41:59.960 --> 42:04.960
And it was never even unfaithful to her, even in his mind.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.960
And she says the same.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.960
It doesn't mean that he never saw a pretty woman,

42:09.960 --> 42:12.960
nor that she never seen a more handsome man.

42:12.960 --> 42:18.960
It seems to mean that they recognized, like, the intentional aspect of the desire of the choice,

42:18.960 --> 42:21.960
and they clearly respected each other, then they just...

42:21.960 --> 42:27.960
Okay, there was a more pleasing sight, but more pleasing sight does not mean last is there.

42:27.960 --> 42:31.960
Last is there when you're careless in regard to the more pleasing sight,

42:31.960 --> 42:33.960
and they were never careless.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.960
Thus, they were never unfaithful to each other.

42:35.960 --> 42:39.960
And they would have praised it, that's exactly how somebody who wants to be a union should live.

42:39.960 --> 42:42.960
And you can see that's already quite a...

42:42.960 --> 42:46.960
quite a good degree of wisdom that most people today, an average person,

42:46.960 --> 42:48.960
just be too conceivable for them.

42:48.960 --> 42:49.960
Why?

42:49.960 --> 42:51.960
Because what you see, you just go for it.

42:51.960 --> 42:55.960
And then even though a lot of union marriage just remains utterly random,

42:55.960 --> 42:58.960
and circumstantial based on just things.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.960
And then, yeah, people divorced, people end up hating each other,

43:01.960 --> 43:02.960
because why?

43:02.960 --> 43:07.960
Just follow the senses, then and now either aging will go bold with it,

43:07.960 --> 43:11.960
or find something better, but then the whole kind of notion of marriage and commitment

43:11.960 --> 43:14.960
is sort of now basically hindering it.

43:14.960 --> 43:18.960
So they feel enslaved by their own choices, basically.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.960
And they only have themselves to blame.

43:20.960 --> 43:21.960
Oh, nothing.

43:21.960 --> 43:22.960
Yep.

43:25.960 --> 43:28.960
So in this suit, again, he goes into that...

43:28.960 --> 43:35.960
You can see in the shot, you can just see, he gives you that short teaching.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.960
And then Melanchio put, he says,

43:41.960 --> 43:49.960
I understand in detail, when it was so the meaning of what was stated by the blessed one.

43:49.960 --> 43:54.960
And then he gives, he says, this verse.

43:54.960 --> 43:58.960
And the Buddha agrees with him, good, good, Melanchio put it,

43:58.960 --> 44:03.960
it is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief.

44:03.960 --> 44:06.960
And I'll just read down to you.

44:09.960 --> 44:13.960
When seeing a sight, mindfulness becomes confused.

44:13.960 --> 44:17.960
If attention is focused on the pleasant aspect,

44:17.960 --> 44:20.960
experiencing it with the mind for the desire,

44:20.960 --> 44:25.960
one remains assuming to cling to it.

44:25.960 --> 44:28.960
Many feelings grow arising from sight.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.960
So again, back to the beginning of the verse,

44:31.960 --> 44:36.960
so it says quite clearly,

44:36.960 --> 44:40.960
that wrongly attending to the pleasant sight,

44:40.960 --> 44:44.960
desire and last and assumption grows in regard to it,

44:44.960 --> 44:48.960
not just by merely having a pleasant sight,

44:48.960 --> 44:52.960
which means pleasant sight or a pleasant sight was never the problem.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.960
It's not the problem.

44:54.960 --> 44:59.960
It's you don't know, not knowing how to attend to it,

44:59.960 --> 45:01.960
you end up being confused.

45:01.960 --> 45:03.960
Being confused, you end up assuming,

45:03.960 --> 45:07.960
the whole desire, the whole, the whole basically thing

45:07.960 --> 45:09.960
ends up proliferating and growing more and more.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.960
And then, yeah, just the feelings grow.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.960
Well, exactly, yeah.

45:14.960 --> 45:17.960
Upon giving into pleasure,

45:17.960 --> 45:20.960
you might sometimes experience more pain.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.960
Then by trying to run away from that pain,

45:23.960 --> 45:25.960
you discovered some new pleasure.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.960
And there was all based on the initial confusion

45:27.960 --> 45:29.960
in regard to pleasant sight,

45:29.960 --> 45:31.960
which you, like, ignorantly,

45:31.960 --> 45:33.960
crave for and went for.

45:33.960 --> 45:37.960
Desired for, delighted in, lasted after.

45:37.960 --> 45:40.960
Because of that, you just created basis for now,

45:40.960 --> 45:42.960
all sorts of pleasant and pleasant neutral.

45:42.960 --> 45:45.960
And giving into that, you create more basis for pleasantness,

45:45.960 --> 45:48.960
for pleasantness. So again, feelings grow.

45:48.960 --> 45:51.960
They're just cutting it off right there, and it doesn't.

45:51.960 --> 45:52.960
Not even.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.960
Well, you can take anything,

45:54.960 --> 45:56.960
no matter how proliferated it is,

45:56.960 --> 45:59.960
you can actually uprooted in its entirety

45:59.960 --> 46:04.960
if you see the nature of craving towards pleasure.

46:04.960 --> 46:08.960
Of nature, nature of avoiding.

46:08.960 --> 46:11.960
Having aversion towards this pleasure.

46:11.960 --> 46:13.960
The nature of indolence towards

46:13.960 --> 46:16.960
neither pleasure nor this pleasure.

46:16.960 --> 46:19.960
By understanding the nature of it,

46:19.960 --> 46:21.960
then that just pertains,

46:21.960 --> 46:24.960
permits the whole, no matter how proliferated the picture is.

46:24.960 --> 46:26.960
Then basically, you kill the roots.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.960
You kill the proliferating life.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.960
There was being fed by ignorance.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.960
You try it up, and then it's like a palm stump.

46:33.960 --> 46:38.960
So the proliferated tree branches remain petrified.

46:38.960 --> 46:40.960
They don't spread anymore.

46:40.960 --> 46:42.960
Ignorance doesn't feel it.

46:42.960 --> 46:45.960
So now it's just dried up habits of certain kind.

46:45.960 --> 46:47.960
The ones they were completely dependent upon

46:47.960 --> 46:49.960
sensuality fall off.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.960
But some of it remains

46:51.960 --> 46:54.960
until the aggregates break apart completely.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.960
For another end.

46:58.960 --> 47:01.960
Maybe you want some of the pure, obviously,

47:01.960 --> 47:04.960
one feelings to grow is like in the pleasure

47:04.960 --> 47:05.960
to get more, more.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.960
Oh, yeah. Well, that's right.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.960
That's why sometimes people like

47:09.960 --> 47:11.960
to expose themselves to the risk of this pleasure,

47:11.960 --> 47:14.960
because it makes them pleasurably regret it.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.960
So within a pleasant, non-threatening situation,

47:17.960 --> 47:20.960
you kind of want to spice it up so to speak.

47:20.960 --> 47:24.960
And then you make yourself kind of liable to some pain as well.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.960
But it's all within the pleasurable image

47:27.960 --> 47:31.960
that you've already fully engaged with.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.960
Like, you know, overcoming challenges and stuff.

47:34.960 --> 47:38.960
You can only engage that on the basis of pleasure.

47:38.960 --> 47:40.960
If the whole thing suddenly turns

47:40.960 --> 47:43.960
and then the whole thing becomes light-threatening.

47:43.960 --> 47:45.960
Oh, now it's serious.

47:45.960 --> 47:49.960
And then you stop engaging in the same way.

47:49.960 --> 47:51.960
But yeah, that's what people, you know,

47:51.960 --> 47:54.960
go after frame, for example.

47:54.960 --> 47:57.960
Even go after risk that, you know,

47:57.960 --> 48:00.960
maybe they'll experience this pleasure.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.960
But it's all within the image of pleasure

48:02.960 --> 48:05.960
that they've initially given to you.

48:05.960 --> 48:07.960
And then proliferated.

48:07.960 --> 48:10.960
And then same, initially given into a version

48:10.960 --> 48:11.960
that you go to this pleasure,

48:11.960 --> 48:13.960
even if you study experiencing pleasure on top of it,

48:13.960 --> 48:15.960
you won't be appreciating it,

48:15.960 --> 48:18.960
because, you know, the mind is upset or whatever else.

48:18.960 --> 48:20.960
So feeling good on top of each other.

48:20.960 --> 48:23.960
But if you stop,

48:23.960 --> 48:24.960
establish mindfulness,

48:24.960 --> 48:26.960
all you can say, a feeling is there.

48:26.960 --> 48:27.960
It doesn't matter.

48:27.960 --> 48:31.960
It doesn't matter if it's the top of the proliferated tree

48:31.960 --> 48:32.960
or the bottom. It doesn't matter.

48:32.960 --> 48:33.960
A feeling has a reason,

48:33.960 --> 48:35.960
which means every feeling,

48:35.960 --> 48:37.960
no matter how many of them have grown,

48:37.960 --> 48:38.960
how many of them have spread proliferated,

48:38.960 --> 48:39.960
goal established,

48:39.960 --> 48:41.960
every feeling carries an nature feeling,

48:41.960 --> 48:43.960
which means in regard to every feeling,

48:43.960 --> 48:45.960
you can practice abandoning of craving.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.960
But they all carry the principle,

48:47.960 --> 48:49.960
the universe of principle,

48:49.960 --> 48:53.960
which principles lead some further.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.960
So for me, you don't have to chase all of these proliferated feelings

48:56.960 --> 48:59.960
as that's impossible.

48:59.960 --> 49:01.960
Now, they're trying to train all these branches

49:01.960 --> 49:02.960
that are constantly growing.

49:02.960 --> 49:03.960
You can't possibly keep up.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.960
Instead, just kill the roots,

49:05.960 --> 49:07.960
approach it,

49:07.960 --> 49:09.960
remove the food from the ground

49:09.960 --> 49:11.960
and the roots are sucking onto it.

49:11.960 --> 49:12.960
That's it.

49:12.960 --> 49:13.960
They die.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.960
You don't have to worry about the branches spreading anymore.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.960
You know for sure, they won't.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.960
Even if you don't know where exactly they have proliferated,

49:19.960 --> 49:20.960
you got so big,

49:20.960 --> 49:22.960
no, you know that you've killed the roots,

49:22.960 --> 49:24.960
one way or the other,

49:24.960 --> 49:33.960
and the trees are being fed proliferation stuff.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.960
Yeah, one task.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.960
Yes.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.960
As opposed to trying to manage,

49:39.960 --> 49:42.960
contain direct,

49:42.960 --> 49:44.960
no, fashion,

49:44.960 --> 49:47.960
the branches.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.960
Yeah, managing.

49:49.960 --> 49:52.960
It's just for management.

49:52.960 --> 49:54.960
You know, many feelings grow,

49:54.960 --> 49:56.960
arising from sight.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.960
The mind is damaged by coldness and cruelty,

49:59.960 --> 50:01.960
heaping up suffering like this.

50:01.960 --> 50:06.960
You said to be far from the barner.

50:06.960 --> 50:07.960
When hearing a sound,

50:07.960 --> 50:09.960
mindfulness becomes confused,

50:09.960 --> 50:11.960
if attention is focused on the pleasant aspect,

50:11.960 --> 50:13.960
experiencing with the mind full of desire

50:13.960 --> 50:15.960
when it mains a sumitur.

50:15.960 --> 50:16.960
Many feelings grow,

50:16.960 --> 50:18.960
arising from sounds.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.960
The mind is damaged by covetousness and cruelty.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.960
Keeping up suffering like this,

50:23.960 --> 50:26.960
you said to be far from the barner.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.960
When it's smelling a smell,

50:28.960 --> 50:31.960
when it's saving a taste,

50:31.960 --> 50:34.960
when touching a touch,

50:34.960 --> 50:38.960
when knowing a mental phenomenon,

50:38.960 --> 50:41.960
it continues,

50:41.960 --> 50:44.960
the mind is damaged

50:44.960 --> 50:48.960
and it's far from the barner.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.960
Then it goes on to say,

50:51.960 --> 50:52.960
seeing a sight with mindfulness,

50:52.960 --> 50:55.960
there is no desire for sight.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.960
The experiencing with the mind full of desire,

50:58.960 --> 51:01.960
one doesn't remain assuming to it.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.960
As it is for someone who lives mindfully,

51:04.960 --> 51:06.960
when repeatedly seeing a sight,

51:06.960 --> 51:08.960
feeling is ended,

51:08.960 --> 51:09.960
not added to.

51:09.960 --> 51:11.960
Reducing suffering like this,

51:11.960 --> 51:14.960
you said to be in the presence of the barner.

51:14.960 --> 51:18.960
To this even, by making mindfully in regard to pleasant sight,

51:18.960 --> 51:20.960
mindfully in regard to unpleasant sight,

51:20.960 --> 51:23.960
so he neither develops lust nor aversion.

51:23.960 --> 51:25.960
Mindfully in regard to neutral,

51:25.960 --> 51:29.960
neither agreeable nor disagreeable sight.

51:29.960 --> 51:31.960
He doesn't develop indolence,

51:31.960 --> 51:32.960
he doesn't develop ignorance,

51:32.960 --> 51:34.960
he doesn't develop delusion.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.960
Which means all of those feelings

51:36.960 --> 51:38.960
arise simultaneously with that.

51:38.960 --> 51:40.960
He understands as they arise,

51:40.960 --> 51:42.960
so he doesn't add to them.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.960
Basically adding to them means

51:44.960 --> 51:49.960
he doesn't induce craving in regard to them.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.960
That's what means ending of the feeling

51:51.960 --> 51:53.960
as it has arisen.

51:53.960 --> 51:55.960
Because when you crave for feeling obviously,

51:55.960 --> 51:57.960
you go further and then you experience

51:57.960 --> 51:59.960
another feeling when it can't do that,

51:59.960 --> 52:01.960
and then another feeling when it can't do that.

52:01.960 --> 52:03.960
There's no piling up,

52:03.960 --> 52:06.960
so to speak, but increasing.

52:06.960 --> 52:08.960
But if you're mindfully in regard to sight,

52:08.960 --> 52:10.960
the feeling that has arisen,

52:10.960 --> 52:13.960
that's it. You see it as impermanent.

52:13.960 --> 52:15.960
By seeing it as impermanent,

52:15.960 --> 52:18.960
why? Because you're mindfully in regard to sight,

52:18.960 --> 52:20.960
there won't be any craving

52:20.960 --> 52:21.960
in regard to that feeling,

52:21.960 --> 52:24.960
because craving requires notion of permanence.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.960
Be it craving for pleasure

52:26.960 --> 52:28.960
or craving for avoiding of pain,

52:28.960 --> 52:29.960
either way.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.960
So by removing the craving,

52:31.960 --> 52:34.960
you stop assuming it.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.960
There's no pedana.

52:37.960 --> 52:41.960
And touching a touch with mindfulness.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.960
There's no desire for touches.

52:43.960 --> 52:45.960
You're experiencing with the mind,

52:45.960 --> 52:47.960
fear of desire one doesn't remain assuming to it.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.960
As it is for someone who lives mindfully,

52:49.960 --> 52:51.960
when repeatedly touching a touch,

52:51.960 --> 52:53.960
feeling is ended,

52:53.960 --> 52:55.960
not added to.

52:55.960 --> 52:56.960
Reducing suffering like this,

52:56.960 --> 52:59.960
is said to be in the presence of nirvana.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.960
That's what I read there one night,

53:01.960 --> 53:04.960
because there's a difference between touch and feeling.

53:04.960 --> 53:07.960
Yeah, absolutely.

53:07.960 --> 53:08.960
You recognize it.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.960
Oh, I feel something in my back.

53:10.960 --> 53:12.960
No, you're touching something in your back.

53:12.960 --> 53:14.960
What is sensation in my knees?

53:14.960 --> 53:17.960
Yeah, that sensation is perception of the touch.

53:17.960 --> 53:20.960
It's not a feeling.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.960
People think sensations are feelings,

53:22.960 --> 53:24.960
sensations are perceptions.

53:24.960 --> 53:34.960
But is that repeatedly practicing mindfulness

53:34.960 --> 53:36.960
in regards to it?

53:36.960 --> 53:38.960
It approaches.

53:38.960 --> 53:39.960
Yeah, feelings.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.960
Reducing suffering like this.

53:41.960 --> 53:42.960
Reducing it.

53:42.960 --> 53:45.960
Because suffering can arise only in the basis of craving.

53:45.960 --> 53:51.960
Encoding can arise only in the basis of ignorance in regard to feelings.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.960
And in the ignorance in regard to feelings,

53:54.960 --> 53:58.960
can arise only in the basis of non-mindfully attending to pleasure,

53:58.960 --> 54:01.960
non-mindfully attending to pain.

54:05.960 --> 54:07.960
Then you're touched by the feeling.

54:07.960 --> 54:08.960
When you're touched by the feeling,

54:08.960 --> 54:11.960
you crave in regard to it.

54:11.960 --> 54:15.960
So by mindfully attending to what's seen,

54:15.960 --> 54:17.960
what's heard, what's taste,

54:17.960 --> 54:20.960
what's touched, what's thought.

54:20.960 --> 54:23.960
But mindful attending to it repetitively

54:23.960 --> 54:25.960
the desire and lust in regard to diminishes,

54:25.960 --> 54:27.960
aversion diminishes,

54:27.960 --> 54:29.960
which means that feelings are not entertained,

54:29.960 --> 54:32.960
not engaged, not crave for.

54:32.960 --> 54:38.960
But each site and so on is either agreeable, disagreeable.

54:38.960 --> 54:41.960
Or neither agreeable nor disagreeable.

54:41.960 --> 54:42.960
So it's always felt.

54:42.960 --> 54:45.960
Oh yeah, perception and feeling are conjoined.

54:45.960 --> 54:47.960
You can't just have perception and feeling coming later.

54:47.960 --> 54:50.960
It's over simultaneous.

54:52.960 --> 54:55.960
That's why the mind is determined by perception and feeling.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.960
So it's experiencing an agreeable sight?

54:58.960 --> 55:02.960
Well, you can say there is an agreeable feeling corresponding to it.

55:02.960 --> 55:06.960
But that still doesn't mean that you're touched by pleasure.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.960
When you're ignorant in regard to agreeable feeling,

55:09.960 --> 55:17.960
you basically, you're touched by pleasure, which means you crave for it.

55:17.960 --> 55:20.960
And the craving is the inclination towards,

55:20.960 --> 55:22.960
the inclination towards?

55:22.960 --> 55:23.960
Yeah.

55:23.960 --> 55:25.960
I'm going to suffer, like just leaning of the mind towards,

55:25.960 --> 55:40.960
leaning the weight, craving for, craving against.
