1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,480
I thought just to ask some thanks which I find the suitors relating to stages of Ayyapugala

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,240
and also inside elements like eight emaciations.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,040
So I will read it later on.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,840
So I'm referring to the suitors and we'll turn on the Kaya 4 suitors which are suitors

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:36,920
by the 7 to 90 and that's in those suitors who are talking about 4 kinds of persons found

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:46,240
existing in the world and he categorized those 4 people, those 4 persons, one is the ascetic

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:55,560
and shaken, second is the white lotus ascetic, third one the red lotus ascetic and the fourth

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,240
one the delicate ascetic among ascetics, so basically it's just referring to Sotapana

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:10,840
Sakadagami and Arhat and each suitah describes this Ayyapugala's side differently and I put

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:22,120
them together so I will just read some qualities of Sotapana which I think we'll be quite

11
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,000
familiar with it.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,480
Here we are at a distraction of three letters, a big with a string enterer, who divers

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:39,840
aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage, he's one of right view and this

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,000
means that he's the one of the right people know about and who has not attained his

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,480
mind's ideal.

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:56,000
So I'll just take this take here, my god I'm interested actually what is the mind's ideal

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
in this suitah?

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Well, for Sotapana is to be an Arhat and to be completely free from suffering, so he's

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:16,080
not quite there yet, but this whole quality is not referred to later one for Sakadagami

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
maybe.

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:29,240
And to pass security from bondage, be an Arhat, okay here I don't have any particular

22
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:36,640
question for Sotapana, so second thing is, he's Sakadagami, he says here with the other

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,640
distraction of three letters and with diminishing of great hatred and illusion, I'll be

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,360
quick one, one's returner, who after coming back to this world only one more time will

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,080
make an end of suffering.

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,520
Here with a distraction of the tense, a vehicle has realized for himself direct knowledge

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,560
in this very light the tenteless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom and having

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,520
enter upon it, he dwells in it yet he does not dwell having contacted with the body

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,360
the eight emancipations.

30
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:22,200
He has actually not just a right view, right intention and other right qualities, even

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,040
over past, but also right knowledge and the right liberation.

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:35,080
This is Sakadagami, and he dwells contemplating the rising and vanishing of the five aggregates

33
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,480
subject to assumption.

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,040
So this is really kind of different described Sotapana, obviously the most interesting one

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,040
was if he has also right knowledge and right liberation.

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,920
It's those two are the ones that Arhatagami develops, which is why he becomes perfect,

37
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,720
which is why he becomes fully light in Arhatagami, it was the right knowledge and right liberation.

38
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,360
There were other suitors and that's mentioned, but those two are basically, he has them,

39
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,240
I think he has a notion of them, basically think of Sakadagami as Sotapana, who has applied

40
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,160
himself more than just the Sotapana.

41
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,600
So then he starts gaining the more of that knowledge, more of that liberation, so it becomes

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,240
almost like a discernible phenomena, discernible factor, but only an Arhat is fully developed

43
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:35,840
as, which is why he is an Arhatagami, so what is, what we mean by knowledge and right liberation?

44
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,520
Basically means just the continuation of the Noble-Afford path means that if those

45
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,160
that develop then he doesn't have to keep doing it anymore, he becomes it, because for

46
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,600
Sotapana, well, for all the areas, the Noble-Afford path they need to keep applying it, keep

47
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,400
sort of sticking to it, keep finding energy for it, keep resisting distraction against

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,200
it, even that's plot of fulfillment, then just the right knowledge and the right liberation

49
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,640
is a result of it.

50
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,680
And would be directly like for Sakadagami, or for this kind of person, create distinction,

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,840
or I'm not over Sotapana, I'm Sakadagami, because Sotapana is Sakadagami, but it keeps

52
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
since then.

53
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,440
Yeah, I don't think there would be.

54
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,040
I think it depends on the faculties of Sakadagami.

55
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,320
He might be, well, if he's faculties of Shapa, he might see that there are more perceivable

56
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,960
difference between when he was a Sotapana, and then after he is sort of weakened the

57
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,080
other factor of sensuality in your world, but it's not, it's just a gradual weakening.

58
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,520
Like, so he can look back and say, yeah, I'm stronger than when I had the right view, but

59
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,840
like, how much stronger?

60
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,080
Well, I am not free from sensuality, which means then I might be at the most Sakadagami.

61
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,520
If you were to be free from sensuality, then you're okay, so I'm, so, but see, if the

62
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,440
Buddha never laid out these four kind of constants, these four kind of guidelines, milestones,

63
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,160
now, cornerstone, milestones, you, they wouldn't have known, all they would have known is,

64
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,360
yeah, I've understood the Dhamma, yeah, my, my last version I've been kind of lessened

65
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
because of the Dhamma, or, oh, yeah, I don't have any more last nora version because

66
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,720
of the Dhamma, or, oh, my mind is completely bright and pure free from suffering and supreme

67
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,840
security of bondage, but they wouldn't have called it in those terms.

68
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,440
The Buddha laid it out only after, like, a constant kind of being harassed by, by questions

69
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,600
or where it is such, in such a month or even more, and where it is, because people wanted

70
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,560
to know how far they were in their practice, and then they would say, well, it's, it's

71
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
a real hassle.

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,200
If every time somebody dies, you come and talk to me and ask me about him, so, and he laid

73
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,600
down these critters, so it's just like a, kind of a general sort of criteria of the

74
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,120
state, and then, you know, because there is, I don't know if you include it, but there's

75
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,120
another sort about Sotapana, where basically it says, well, the common sort of description

76
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:21,160
is a seven lifetimes and most, but there is one sort that says, Sotapana dies, and basically,

77
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,160
while he's still in that experience of death, he becomes an Arhan, then I think the other

78
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,240
one is while he's in between, kind of, because he becomes an Arhan, or while he's getting

79
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,320
ready to be reborn or something, and he becomes an Arhan, or he becomes an Arhan upon landing

80
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,240
or upon being reborn.

81
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,600
So you realize, yeah, it's at most, so again, you give a general description, they will

82
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,640
include everybody who would be a Sotapana, but it doesn't mean the Sotapana has to go

83
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
through seven.

84
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
No, it just depends.

85
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:58,680
How much he has applied himself, how much, how much of these uppertilers are here sort

86
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,080
of abolished or weakened, and then, and how clear his knowledge is.

87
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
How much effort he has invested in the repetition of that knowledge.

88
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,760
So then, moment of death might be enough for Sotapana, and quite often probably would be,

89
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,360
as it was mentioned in the Sotas, that, oh, yeah, that is the complete dispassion, release

90
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,320
and so on, when they're dying, basically, when they have no more room for any distraction

91
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,640
or carelessness or complacency.

92
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,800
But if that doesn't happen yet, what they would have told us then, well, they won't

93
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,400
be reborn shortly enough human, and it would be at most several lifetimes, not more than

94
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
that.

95
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,040
And you understand this lifetimes more than the traditional way, basically, die and

96
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
then you will.

97
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Well, yeah, but not necessarily as a human.

98
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,480
So you might be higher.

99
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,040
Well, basically, seven more returns.

100
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,680
Seven more reappearances, re-emergence at most.

101
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,080
Well, it can be two and a half.

102
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,480
I was thinking that maybe seven, seven, number seven is more metaphorical, because sometimes

103
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,880
number just means like, I don't know, there are 500 are, and this means exactly 500 means

104
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
like just a lot.

105
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
It means seven is few.

106
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
You, maybe?

107
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah.

108
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,240
Well, actually, yes, probably.

109
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,520
Because as you read, like, and even when it comes to anagams, like, ah, not written,

110
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
he's going to be incurable.

111
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,440
But then you read that, I think it's an anagami signita, they're like all these different

112
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,360
types of heavens, like, I don't know, with search or something, based on the different

113
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,680
fact, how strong the anagami's were in their understanding.

114
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,640
So it's basically just like one gradual development, then the Buddha laid out milestones for just

115
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,320
as an incentive, as a as a guideline, as a kind of clarification, as a sort of a place

116
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,680
of confidence as well, because you can, you can all, you understood.

117
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,720
Like, if you have, before the Buddha described what Sotapana is, the actual Sotapana is what

118
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,200
they've understood the Dharma, and be free from three fetters, they wouldn't have necessarily

119
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,400
known, almost certainly they wouldn't have known that they cannot be reborn, lower than

120
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,800
a human, that they cannot be reborn more than seven times, they wouldn't have known

121
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
that.

122
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,240
But, but saying by defining is like, oh, yeah, so then they, they do feel the release and

123
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,640
kind of a sense of, a sense of freedom and accomplishment, and that's quite important

124
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
as well.

125
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,680
And also, in a similar manner, by defining what Sotapana is, in terms of which practice

126
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,320
you're free from, what Sotapana can do, what Sotapana can do, what Sotapana can do, what

127
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,280
the Buddha is intentions is similar things, and you didn't, so does then actually it clarifies

128
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:46,280
you what you need to understand, so you actually kind of defines the work, defines the object

129
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,040
for your contemplation, because if you do understand, you would be the one, it's just, that's

130
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
how it works.

131
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,680
So, there is no look in between, no, I understand, but I'm not Sotapana, nope, you can't have

132
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
that.

133
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,000
So, you either understand, in which case you're Sotapana, so I understand, if I'm not Sotapana,

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,880
no, I'm not means I don't understand, because that's the only way of thinking that can

135
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,320
actually then keep you coding, coding you on towards understanding the Sotapana, if there

136
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,960
is anything in between that compromise will obstruct, so if you are able to hold a contradiction

137
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,840
of yes I know, and at the same time know that you, the one who doesn't know, well that's

138
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,640
massive contradiction of a very fundamental, essentially coding, somebody can tolerate

139
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,880
that, means they cannot become Sotapana, because of that, so it has to be black and white,

140
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,040
and be like, oh you know, well that's, yeah, it's harsh, but what do you want, you want

141
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,520
harsh, what do you want easy, that can kind of keep you put to dinner or harsh, that can

142
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,880
sort of make a Sotapana, and it's so hard, it's harsh only because you're sensitive,

143
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,320
so basically if a person thinks I've only a Sotapana, nobody short in a Sotapana understands

144
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,200
the Dhamma, means that any notion of them understanding the Dhamma unless they're Sotapana,

145
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,880
they will not take for granted, which means they will eventually understand what Dhamma

146
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,160
is, but if they take it, if they take it as that which they have understood, they won't

147
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,040
be making a further effort to understand it, and they will take it as that which they

148
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,600
have understood, if they are able to maintain conservation of somebody, yeah, I understood,

149
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,800
and at the same time know that they're not Sotapana.

150
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,200
So we may quote Sotapana doesn't have doubts anymore, but when he comes to some presidious

151
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,280
ness Sotapana, and maybe sees, and can he say, oh I'm sorry, I don't understand that one.

152
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,080
Yeah, yeah, probably.

153
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,480
Like you probably mentioned, there are reservations and some other things, but yeah, yeah, because

154
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,080
there are so many, so many different ways, well, they're all ways along the same universal

155
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,920
principles, but they're different approaches, and they're different expositions, and different

156
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,080
descriptions, and yeah, I mean, most of those people back in the day they haven't heard

157
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
it all.

158
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,800
So then, if they were to dwell on it, or they were to talk more about it, I'm sure they

159
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,800
would see it within the principles, but not by default, like suddenly they know everything

160
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,960
and everyone who ever said it, no, it doesn't work for that.

161
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,000
So basically, the Sotapana stage would be a really recognition that all these things,

162
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,480
this kind of, this is impossible, actually, to own five aggregates, like feeling, perception,

163
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
and so on.

164
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Well, they would stop.

165
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:34,840
They would basically cease to assume a separate center of experience, the center experience

166
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,560
that is basically independent of the five aggregates, it's independent of anything that appears

167
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,400
for it, which is the Atavada, they cannot think that anymore, and by not being able to

168
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,160
think that anymore, all they would see is five aggregates arising, five aggregates ceasing.

169
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,040
So basically, all these aggregates would more feel like in longs more there, rather than

170
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,280
actually something that belongs to me.

171
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Well, yes, but see, yeah, describing that would imply a comparison between hard feels without

172
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,160
atavada and hard feels without atavada.

173
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:11,280
Now, the Sotapana would feel released shortly after abolishing atavada, but then that

174
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
is the normal state.

175
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,600
So here's no old reference anymore to compare to this, which means that's it now.

176
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,280
It was very beginning, it didn't belong to him, so no, no, no, no, what I mean is he

177
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,600
doesn't have the old reference of atavada to compare to the new reference of all the things

178
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
don't belong to me.

179
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,120
There's a memory of it, but any kind of emotional release there will be initially upon understanding

180
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,680
until things settle, but in afterwards he cannot go back and kind of have the experience

181
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,240
of atavada and then compare it to the experience of the non atavada, which is what you compare

182
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,400
basically when you said like, oh, there in terms of how much release there is no, because

183
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,800
I would require him to still be able to access atavada, he can still access atavada

184
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,600
you're not free from it.

185
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
You have an abolished it.

186
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,600
He doesn't need much of remembering his argument mindless and care.

187
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Yeah, because the right view is what his center experience is now.

188
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,080
So all he has to do really is not actively distract himself from that, because if he stops

189
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,760
distracting automatically the mind will go back to what is based on, and for so the

190
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,080
premise, based upon the right view, for putugina is based upon atavada.

191
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:26,280
So basically it's like he cannot anymore control, he doesn't he realizes in the first place

192
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,880
he was not as he could control in the feeling, the perception and the whole nature.

193
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Yeah, there was no separate identity of self apart from those things.

194
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,720
So if he still remains, if he's still affected by those things to some degree, which is

195
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,840
what one would be, he would be just a degree that he still might kind of regard it as

196
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,400
for me, my mind, in relation to me, but not in relation to that independent sense of

197
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,520
self as a view, as like this, that just cannot, cannot rise.

198
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,240
So yeah, he couldn't possibly take things in such a permanent manner, even if he were

199
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,360
to make the effort to do so, he would be inconceivable for him.

200
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,200
So there's still a memory in this kind of longing, this kind of distance.

201
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,880
And the reason why he would be inconceivable for him is because things were truly impossible

202
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:24,280
to begin with, and that's why 100 is possible, by finding that out, you have then basically

203
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,480
undone the mistake of not knowing that he was impossible, which means what you have

204
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,080
to do that mistake, you can't really go back to it, even if you think about it, it just

205
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,080
doesn't, that it can't, it's inconceivable, it cannot happen.

206
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,720
And because if you didn't know before, you had a visa, that's why you were understanding

207
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,600
that now, this is why it was all the time, this kind of longing, basically kind of frustration

208
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,640
for Tanka, praying maybe to Gros for me, so I feel like, you know, I think the other

209
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:58,440
way around actually, I mean longing is more longing, like leaning forwards, like, for

210
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,480
it, you know, it's important for me, perception for me, it just kind of just very subtle,

211
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:11,160
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so you can kind of realize that, but then it's still time that

212
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,720
this old comma diminishes, basically still kind of effect, maybe a habit, can quite

213
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
have it, so the one still has a habit.

214
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,080
Well, he still has a habit, but he still also has a sense of I am, in terms of conceit,

215
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:35,680
yeah, so, yeah, it's not as much as for Petudjana, who is like fully self-centred in a completely

216
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,120
assumed gratuitous center of art of art, but still, so only for an artist, you can truly

217
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,120
say that all he has left are the habits, so the one still has a good three-quarters of

218
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,040
responsibility for his habits, especially if you don't have habits of last version

219
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,240
of evolution, and it's impossible, but you're really not habits then, and it's impossible

220
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,840
if he doesn't take this possibility for his sexuality, he can't ignore it, or he can

221
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:11,240
ignore it on the art of certain extent, because all he has to do is stop, to take a break

222
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,160
from all the destruction and unholes some habits, and at that time he will be looking at

223
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,680
his right view, from his right view, he just, that is his place of rest, so all he has

224
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,520
to do is not, not distract himself, not sort of get careless in the sense of take, and

225
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,800
then it would, at most, in seven lifetimes, basically, in any way, but he wants to fast

226
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
all he needs to do is practice his strength, basically.

227
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,600
It's like, well, all that has to be done, not to put the stick back to the water, that's

228
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
all.

229
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:51,600
There's things which are really rare in Saka Pekami, it says, if I read it again, here

231
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,800
with destruction of things, the Biko has realized what himself direct knowledge, in this

232
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,760
way alive, the dangerous liberation of mine, the liberation of wisdom, and having thanks

233
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,280
upon it, he trusts in it.

234
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,960
This is listed in Saka Pekami, does it mean this thing, so does it, doesn't have, why

235
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:29,040
it's just, I don't know if it's anything, no, it sounds bad, I don't see, this is not

236
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Saka Pekami.

237
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I didn't make any mistake.

238
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
If you didn't enter, the eight minutes patience comes later on.

239
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,440
No, it says, here with the destruction of the three fighters, the diminishing of greed

240
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,840
is in delusion because once you turn it, who after coming back to this world, who after

241
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,640
coming back to this world, one more time, will make an end to suffering.

242
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,560
And in the next paragraph that you say, here with the destruction of the ten, the Biko

243
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,160
has realized for himself direct knowledge, in this very life, the tenest liberation

244
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,960
of mine, liberation of wisdom, having entered upon it, he does it, he does not dwell, having

245
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,280
connected with the body, the eight emancipations.

246
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,800
So oh, I see, the last bit is different, okay, he dwells in it, he does not, I thought

247
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
just everything in the first sense, and that's our answer.

248
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:17,040
But even that, I think, well, I guess, no, this can be also said basically for a sotapana.

249
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:24,120
Because sotapana knows what nibana is, and he can enter upon it with wisdom, liberation

250
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,160
by wisdom, and he can be dwell in it.

251
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,160
But for as long as his body, the phenomenon of the body, I must say, like body into some

252
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
mystical experience.

253
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,320
But for as long as that body does not get established in it, he won't be in nibana

254
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
as an other hand.

255
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,720
But it is the same nibana, it is the same understanding, in that sense, yeah, even sotapana

256
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,080
has the notion of the right knowledge and right liberation, but it's very weak notion.

257
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,480
And as I said, the only other hand is fully developed it.

258
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,080
So basically, the difference between sotapana and sotapana is basically that, like you

259
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,320
said, sotapana is just more developed, sotapana, and one of the differences between

260
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,720
sotapana and sotapana has also the right knowledge and right liberation.

261
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Okay.

262
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,080
And then it says, it was contemplating rising and seizing, the fact that it is a Dritra

263
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,400
assumption, that's also sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana.

264
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,960
And then, amagami, here, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, the biku is one

265
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:36,080
of continuous births, due to attained by nibana, without returning from that world.

266
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:44,800
And also, the births have been concentrated with the body, the eight emancipations, and

267
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:55,600
the same body, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana,

268
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
sotapana.

269
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:10,960
And then, as for the very, very fine type of reborn sotapana, sotapana, sotapana, sotapana.

270
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,480
So to that degree of residue, to that degree of almost, is going to have very well in one

271
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:24,040
of the purebotes, but even then, they told you that sanitamika, just dozens of them.

272
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,800
like one place for all noises, depending how much residue you have left, and you can measure,

273
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,000
even the voodoo can measure that, it's so subtle, because he said he will obtain the final

274
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,160
variation here now, oh, if there is an any residue left, he will go to the pierabot and then be

275
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:51,160
finished there, so, and that's why often Anagami's would have overestimated himself and thinking

276
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,640
there were other ants, but they couldn't tell, the voodoo would only be able to tell what I

277
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,600
see in the mind, but which means Anagami, that's already person free from sensuality,

278
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,600
aversion, virtually free from all the ignorance, he still couldn't tell, because he's just so,

279
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,160
so subtle left over, but it doesn't matter, if it's that subtle it doesn't matter,

280
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,520
because they're going to have a spontaneous rebirth in such a refined realm,

281
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:24,440
preserved only for such beings, and he'll be going up, but very soon upon landing again,

282
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,120
might be longer, might be a bit much more longer, and another one just here, just imagine.

283
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,040
I think there's some sort of some variations, yes, you know, it could be quite,

284
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,360
you're ready to jump from sort of the part of the Arabian ship, but what prevents

285
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:47,400
him to go to all to the Arabian ship, and he remains to be Anagami, is he's delighted and done well.

286
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,280
Right, just kind of step there, I think I'm holding on the last thing.

287
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,240
Yeah, yeah, no, I remember that, yeah.

288
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,480
It's just not the link from you.

289
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,720
Yeah.

290
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,240
Maybe it could be a little bit excited.

291
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:12,360
It's not that small, you're just not looking back thoroughly at the right view that brought

292
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,240
into that place, and not just because even that, even at the right view, you just completely

293
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,040
developed this passion towards, discussed this passion, relinquishment, everything else,

294
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,600
and then you're fully enlightened, and it's really just extinguished.

295
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,600
So they might not necessarily do that sufficiently, they might not necessarily experience

296
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,920
complete need be that towards the right view then.

297
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,760
And the most interesting things is he dwells hadn't contacted.

298
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,280
Contacted with a body, the eight emancipations?

299
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,960
Yeah, you should have gone to the eight emancipations.

300
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,480
Yeah, what is the body world?

301
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,080
What is the translation emancipation?

302
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:03,720
Art of immolca, okay, like liberation, okay, yes, shall I just read first?

303
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,120
Well, yes, sure, and then one processing Europa, Ciceropa.

304
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,200
Why not preceding the Europa internalists, Ciceropa externally?

305
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,520
One is released upon the idea of the beautiful,

306
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,720
or translation can be one is focused on and beautiful.

307
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:28,680
So, fourth one is through the complete surmounting of perception of Europa,

308
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:37,160
the passing away of perception of impingement and content and non-attention

309
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,720
to perception of diversity, perceiving in brackets.

310
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,920
Space is infinite, one enters and dwells in the base of infinity of space.

311
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,160
This fifth one is the same thing, consciousness is infinite,

312
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,640
six, there's nothing, seven, need a perception, non-attention,

313
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,440
eight, Ciceropa perception.

314
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,120
So, just first four really interesting things.

315
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,840
Well, the point is, you know, like, I mean, they are eight different,

316
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,360
but not eight different in a sense of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

317
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,520
But it's basically one within that, you can go to the second one,

318
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,120
within that, you can go to the third one, within that, you can go to the fourth one.

319
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,400
So, if you have one, definitely you conducted all of them.

320
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,480
But how far, up that one, you will go.

321
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,000
That's basically how to find, in terms of development, your mind gets.

322
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,640
So, does every, every area, Puglara, say, a lot to do all these things?

323
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,080
No, not every Anogami and Arhant.

324
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,360
Not all.

325
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,640
No, that's the thing.

326
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:55,080
So, they contact those principles of such a liberation,

327
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,760
which means they get one, the first one.

328
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,480
One is the Ciceropa.

329
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,680
Oh, Ciceropa, yeah.

330
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,040
So, start with that.

331
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,640
Within that, they can, you know, is they're beyond,

332
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,800
as sometimes you're reading the service,

333
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,480
and then go further, in further, in further, until they go what?

334
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,160
The ultimate, and there is no beyond.

335
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,560
And it was a similar description when he came to Janas,

336
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,000
and that's a Sariputra in Magi Manika, one by one,

337
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,520
steps whenever, when he comes to the session of session.

338
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,680
He says, there is no beyond this, that's it.

339
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,440
So, basically, Anogami, sort of an Arhant,

340
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,320
Sakarigami, have not contacted with the body,

341
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,120
the principle of such, the liberation of two of these things.

342
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,520
Huh?

343
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,960
The understanding is phenomenal.

344
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,240
Well, I think that, because even, even those,

345
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,920
those are probably along the same lines that say,

346
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,840
A. Sotabana would have developed his mind.

347
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,880
So, he would have, he would have started

348
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
to get in the principle of the mind development,

349
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,760
which means that he hasn't contacted with the body,

350
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,600
which means he hasn't really experienced those liberations.

351
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,160
So, but if he, if he experienced,

352
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,680
well, a contact with the body means basically,

353
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,720
making, making such experience actual present,

354
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
not just resolve upon wisdom,

355
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,040
you can, you can clear it up with wisdom,

356
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,680
but actually, you haven't been establishing your mind

357
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,960
in the sense that, now, that experience is what is present

358
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,640
for you, actually, right there and then.

359
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,760
So, going to the body, wouldn't we,

360
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,280
let it take some mystical strength?

361
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,240
No, no, no, no, no, no.

362
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,720
Contacting with the body just means making it actual,

363
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,920
as opposed to, like, a peripheral understanding.

364
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,440
And it can be very, that's how, like,

365
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,560
people can resolve upon wisdom,

366
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,080
upon the element of Nibana, and become an Arhant.

367
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,520
Doesn't mean the resolve is put to, now,

368
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
you need to have the element of Nibana,

369
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,720
you need to understand what it is.

370
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,400
And then, if the mind gets resolve upon it,

371
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,800
it will drag the body into the actual experience of it,

372
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,400
if the mind doesn't come up.

373
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,480
So, that's where the pain of emotive,

374
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,000
like, liberate through wisdom.

375
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,280
Basically, he, he kind of shoots his mind out there,

376
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,640
towards the right principle that he isn't

377
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,480
understood through the clarity of his wisdom,

378
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,080
but he's actually quite far removed

379
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,880
in terms of actually experiencing

380
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,680
as an actual reason phenomenon that Nibana

381
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,360
are attaching him in the body.

382
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,800
But if he mind stays in it,

383
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,960
the body will eventually catch up with it,

384
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,360
and then he would say, yeah, he was liberated.

385
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,040
All you have, those whose mind is developed,

386
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,400
they're not necessarily understanding

387
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,480
all the, all the subtleties of Nibana,

388
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,320
but they clearly have the mind developed

389
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,400
to the extent of, yeah, they're actually experiencing

390
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,600
that with the body, that kind of the undetermined element,

391
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
and they can, they, they're experiencing,

392
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,800
they can hold onto it, they can have it.

393
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,200
Present, as opposed to, you know,

394
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,640
it's not like a momentary song.

395
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,240
So, that's like when people are sort of liberated,

396
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,880
both ways.

397
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,200
And, and in this case, basically, it's that.

398
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,720
So, these eight, just think of it as one,

399
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,560
and think of that one as standing as a description

400
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,600
of touching the body.

401
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:50,920
That's it.

402
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,040
So, within that, you can keep refining that

403
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,360
to the point of cessation and perception and feeling,

404
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,240
but you don't have to.

405
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,200
You can become a fool in life in Narahana,

406
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,480
just by touching the principle.

407
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,560
So, just by getting the first one.

408
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,840
So, how important is it now to understand this sutra?

409
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,360
What sutra?

410
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Well, that sutra just gives you the ultimate

411
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,000
perfect scenario of going through all the eight.

412
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Like, in the same sense, whenever Janas go,

413
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,360
they go through all four.

414
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,600
Then, whenever the material sort of establishments

415
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,320
of mind are described, again, they're all described.

416
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,960
But, there are all the sutras that we've said,

417
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,800
it's the strength of the first Janas,

418
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,240
enough for our own children.

419
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,920
Anagami needs to understand the first Jan,

420
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,360
and he can become fully enlightened,

421
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,880
or a hand. So, you might not have necessarily touched with the body,

422
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,040
the seven, and the eight, of those liberations,

423
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,520
but he certainly touched them all in a sense,

424
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,160
that the principle, which is kind of the first one,

425
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,520
the second one, and so on,

426
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,600
has been understood and has been touched with the body.

427
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,120
We've got one by one, at least, first four.

428
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,800
So, one possessing urukatsu is rupa.

429
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,760
This ice is almost just...

430
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Well, see, this can be a long discussion,

431
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,200
because it's a sort of thing.

432
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,080
So, basically, if I were to sort of describe the emboleads to you,

433
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,840
then we have to sort of address the meaning of those words as well,

434
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,400
and then I might have to do the meaning of those words as well.

435
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,520
So, most concisely, basically,

436
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,360
the experience consists of two points of view,

437
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,480
simultaneously present.

438
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,240
One coming from the direction of the conscious body present in the world,

439
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,600
and another one coming from the point of view of, basically,

440
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,120
nama rupa.

441
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,520
So, the two points of view at once,

442
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,480
which is why reflection is possible,

443
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,600
which is why our energy is possible, really,

444
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,080
because if there is only one point of view to your experience,

445
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,520
right there and then, there would be a sense of self.

446
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,560
There would be a center.

447
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,920
But the reason, there's always two.

448
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,800
They cannot be one.

449
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,000
So, if there's always two,

450
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,360
they cannot be one self.

451
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,600
They cannot be one conceit.

452
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,160
So, two points of view of one.

453
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,600
So, imagine you've become very skilled.

454
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,400
There was two points of view of rupa.

455
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,480
Simultaneous, that's what five aggregates are.

456
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,440
It's two points of view.

457
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,400
Two things simultaneously present.

458
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,920
Two directions, two points of view.

459
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,320
They don't come together.

460
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,040
They don't meet.

461
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,760
They don't cross.

462
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,960
There is two points of view

463
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,120
with their respective directions.

464
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,520
And then, because you have two points of view,

465
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,520
you can sometimes see the same thing twice.

466
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,720
But it doesn't mean that you see it independent of those points of view.

467
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,440
It just means you recognize that thing is double present.

468
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,720
Two points, it appears in both directions.

469
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
And that's it.

470
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
But there is no outside of those directions, by the way.

471
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,920
So, attention cannot be resting on one point of view

472
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,120
or the other point of view.

473
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,320
But it's the assumption of the external in regard to the two points of view

474
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,720
that causes the whole confusion and so on.

475
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
So, imagine you've removed all the confusion.

476
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,920
And I've just said two points of view.

477
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,520
And, because of that,

478
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,960
the confuses two points of view is that

479
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,480
it doesn't see them.

480
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
It doesn't see the two points of view.

481
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,400
It's just me, basically.

482
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,640
So, imagine you remove the confusion in regard to two points of view.

483
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
And, well, the possibilities are endless.

484
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Well, not endless.

485
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
They will end in this station and perception and feeling.

486
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,640
So, with one point of view,

487
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
you cannot perceive the other point of view.

488
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
With the other point of view,

489
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
you can perceive the other point of view.

490
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Or with the other point of view, you cannot perceive the other point of view.

491
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,640
So, I mean, while we're pursuing a little bit internally,

492
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
it's a little bit stunning.

493
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,640
I would basically have it before.

494
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:43,640
Yes, it is.

495
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
It's just a principle.

496
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
It's just a principle.

497
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,640
Okay, then you can sort of move along, really.

498
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Or, to the point of, when you basically stop giving attention to either points of view.

499
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
And then, that's the cessation.

500
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,640
Well, they will pretend that the other,

501
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
are the four, really.

502
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Like, in between the two points of view, so to speak.

503
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Not externally,

504
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,640
just, basically, not based on the two points of view.

505
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Whereby, it will culminate in cessation of perception and feeling.

506
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,640
Or the both points of view.

507
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,640
The word beautiful,

508
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,640
in those third lines, which is interesting,

509
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,640
that you're beautiful or focused on in the beautiful.

510
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
Well, there's another, I don't know if it's in the sense of the nonsense,

511
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,640
and it says, he sees beautiful in ugly.

512
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
Or he sees ugly in the beautiful.

513
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
Ah, actually, ah, I'm comfortable to suit that.

514
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Right, well, it's, it's, it's, again, it's on the same things.

515
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,640
Because the super limiter, it's obviously always on the basis of what is kind of,

516
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,640
a limiter, and that limiter is always basically a suba.

517
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
In the sense.

518
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
Sure.

519
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Okay, go for a recording.

520
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
One recipient of forms internally,

521
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
cis forms externally,

522
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
limited, beautiful, and ugly.

523
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,640
One recipient of forms internally, cis forms externally,

524
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,640
measure as beautiful or ugly.

525
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
One not recipient of forms internally,

526
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,640
cis forms externally, limited, beautiful, or ugly.

527
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,640
One not recipient of forms internally, cis forms externally,

528
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
measure as beautiful or ugly.

529
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,640
One not recipient of forms internally, cis forms externally,

530
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
blue ones,

531
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
blue in color,

532
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,640
with a blue, with a blue tint.

533
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
And that goes straight to the yellow,

534
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
because then it's red and it's white.

535
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
So, first one is,

536
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,640
this is like the white recipient of forms internally,

537
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,640
cis forms externally,

538
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,640
limited, beautiful, or ugly.

539
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
So, say, basically, the money,

540
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
the money really about super limiter and so on.

541
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,640
Yeah, you can see beautiful in ugly.

542
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Oh, you can see ugly and beautiful.

543
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
And basically, discerning that,

544
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
that depends upon the two point of view,

545
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
present at once,

546
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
you would see that, well,

547
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
beautiful in terms of intoxication loses its power,

548
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
because you just see beautiful,

549
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,640
that simultaneously seen as ugly.

550
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,640
So, you could just resolve upon seeing the beautiful

551
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
in everything that is really around you,

552
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
which is ugly,

553
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
or you could resolve to see ugly in everything that's beautiful.

554
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
It doesn't matter.

555
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
It doesn't matter. The point is dispassion

556
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
in regard to the two.

557
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
So, only when people have one point of view

558
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
and what they have presented,

559
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
well, when they assume one point of view,

560
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
and what they have presented in front of them,

561
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
is the beautiful, there's that kind of mesmerizing

562
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
and lasting song with the beautiful,

563
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
mind is locked up on it.

564
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
You see, it's simultaneously,

565
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
just simultaneously present, again,

566
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
as another point of view,

567
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
automatically cannot be as beautiful,

568
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
which means it's ugly,

569
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
for whatever reason.

570
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
And then the second one is about,

571
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
the first one was like,

572
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
it's limited,

573
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
but then becomes, measure us.

574
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
Yeah, infinite.

575
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Infinite.

576
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
So, finer,

577
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
arises on the basis of infinity,

578
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
so only because it's possible for things to be infinite,

579
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,640
they can be finer.

580
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
So, in the same sense,

581
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
a finer thing, a defined thing,

582
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
right in front of you,

583
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
that has a reason to view your point of view,

584
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
you discern the other point of view,

585
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
becoming through that thing,

586
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,640
and then you see, yeah,

587
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
it's on the basis of infinity.

588
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
The domain of eight point of view,

589
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,640
one of the point of view,

590
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
or the nature of the point of view,

591
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
the nature of the direction is that infinity.

592
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
So, you start seeing that,

593
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,640
while the finer thing is present in front of you.

594
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
So, with limitless,

595
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
you see limited,

596
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
or with measureless,

597
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
you see limited,

598
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
or with limited,

599
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
just what point of view you attend to,

600
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,640
and what aspect of the point of view you attend to.

601
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
And again,

602
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,640
the purpose of that,

603
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
is the full dispassion

604
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
in regards to the five other rates,

605
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
the structure of the experience.

606
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
So, you don't have to really say that one,

607
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
if like it's least,

608
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
or one to eight.

609
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
No, of course,

610
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
in the same sense,

611
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
like the casinos,

612
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
the ten casinos,

613
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
you can develop a full energy upon one,

614
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
upon the first one,

615
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
or maybe if somebody else is on the second one,

616
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
or maybe if somebody is on the third one,

617
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
but not, you know, up to ten,

618
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
that's it.

619
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,640
But doesn't mean you have to go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

620
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
ten, I need a service read.

621
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Sorry, eight casinos.

622
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,640
You know,

623
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
it's only four missing institutions.

624
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
So, there's one, I think the ten casinos.

625
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Sorry.

626
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
The four elements,

627
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
the four colors,

628
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
and then the space in the consciousness.

629
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
But the colors is four.

630
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
And then space in the consciousness.

631
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
But it doesn't matter,

632
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,640
because the first casino is already

633
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
the principal casinos there.

634
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
So, you're just refining the same principle

635
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
that you get in the first place.

636
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,640
So, you don't have to.

637
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Yeah, it's interesting.

638
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,640
This is exactly the four colors,

639
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
plan, what I was talking about,

640
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
what's perception.

641
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
The perception perceived blue, yellow, red, and white.

642
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Yeah.

643
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,640
And there's a nice splitter.

644
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
There's a verse, actually,

645
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
saying, having touched with the body,

646
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
the deadless element,

647
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
free from clinging,

648
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
having realized the linkishing

649
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
of clinging,

650
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
his stains are gone.

651
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
The fully alighting one proclaims

652
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
the sorrowless state

653
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
that is void of stain.

654
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,640
So, then with our other hands,

655
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,640
says, here with the destruction of the tent,

656
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
the vehicle has realized,

657
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
for himself, with the wreck knowledge,

658
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
in this very light,

659
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
the tankless liberation of mine,

660
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
liberation,

661
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
white wisdom,

662
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,640
and having entered on it,

663
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,640
he dwells in it,

664
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,640
and he also

665
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
do well,

666
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,640
and having contacted with the body,

667
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
the eight manifestations.

668
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Yeah, he dwells

669
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,640
in it, that's his actual experience, basically.

670
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
That's when those, I think,

671
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
thinking the notes is imagining kind of there.

672
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
I didn't even disagree with some translation,

673
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,640
kind of what it was,

674
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,640
but he mentions that, oh,

675
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
this is the kind of show,

676
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
to kind of show how, like,

677
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
an area,

678
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
sort of fall away from the banner,

679
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640
and then there are problems, sort of,

680
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,640
not falling away.

681
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,640
There are problems not falling away from the banner,

682
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
and that's when they committed suicide,

683
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,640
things like that, because they had kind of, oh,

684
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
got sick, and then they couldn't.

685
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
So, yeah,

686
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
it's one thing to understand the banner,

687
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,640
to kind of develop it,

688
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,640
to the point of that,

689
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,640
becoming your basis,

690
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
of, you know, how you replace,

691
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
at a lot of the right view,

692
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
well, then replace that right view,

693
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,640
with, like, a fully, sort of,

694
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,640
just relinquished,

695
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,640
undetermined element.

696
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Turned in the banner.

697
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
So, that takes time to develop it.

698
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
That's when it's a noble effort path, kind of,

699
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
eightfold, sort of, covering different aspects of it,

700
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
as needed,

701
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
because some people would be,

702
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
because of this, some people would be falling away,

703
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
because of that,

704
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
and that's when some people fall away less,

705
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
or fall away less far.

706
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
So, you have different areas, you have,

707
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
within the defined areas,

708
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
you have different types.

709
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
It's a really weak sort of banner,

710
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
it's barely sort of a banner, it's strong sort of a banner,

711
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,640
it's existed,

712
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,640
because they get reborn in different places,

713
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,640
because of the different strength.

714
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
These four kinds of beings,

715
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
the number ones,

716
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
and they also take the skillfulives,

717
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
for people maybe,

718
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
grasping wrongly, and for boosting the ego.

719
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Some people go to another extreme,

720
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,640
or you just make a political,

721
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
and just be here,

722
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
and don't think about these four stages.

723
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Well, yeah.

724
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
Some people would say,

725
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
it's just like a carer than a donkey,

726
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,640
keeps encouraging,

727
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,640
you know, just, like,

728
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
open the stage to go to the stage.

729
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
So, there's nothing wrong with that.

730
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
This is actually,

731
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,640
but I think it's better to accept them as criterias,

732
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,640
because if you don't,

733
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,640
then you won't be making effort.

734
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
When people say,

735
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
ah, don't try to become anything.

736
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Well, they would say that only because they haven't become anything.

737
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
So, then they start dismissing the goal of becoming something

738
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
valuable,

739
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
because if it's,

740
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
no, it becomes a sort of a banner,

741
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
because that is what you're supposed to do.

742
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,640
So, it's good enough to become a sucker again.

743
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Of course.

744
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
It's good to say that.

745
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
Well, somebody here is all such and such and such and such and such,

746
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,640
such a banner.

747
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
Well, I can do it then,

748
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:11,640
because of that craving,

749
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
he actually makes the effort and does it.

750
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,640
But if the one who hears about somebody

751
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
becomes sort of a banner or somebody coming out of hand

752
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,640
says, oh, there is nothing to become anyway,

753
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
you can know for sure he won't be making an effort.

754
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
That's just how it works.

755
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
Why would he be making an effort when he dismissed the goal?

756
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,640
He dismissed the name.

757
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,640
So, that's why the Buddha was encouraging such aim,

758
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,640
so that you can crave for it,

759
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
because of which you would abandon the craving

760
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,640
and then actually become one sort of a banner.

761
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,640
So, only people have got anywhere in the book,

762
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,640
who didn't get anywhere in the practice,

763
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,640
would be dismissing it,

764
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
who would say, they would say things like,

765
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
oh, there's nothing to be able to try to become anything,

766
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
there's just nothing to be becoming,

767
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
or they would say things like,

768
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,640
the more you practice, the less you know,

769
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
and I've been 30 years in robes and, you know,

770
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
I feel like I know even less,

771
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
as if that's a good thing,

772
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,640
should be embarrassed to say that.

773
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
That's how you're wasting.

774
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,640
Means you actually should be more embarrassed.

775
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Imagine there is something you need to learn,

776
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
something you need to get fixed,

777
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,640
and you fix it on a second day,

778
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
and then you meet somebody who can't fix it for 10 years.

779
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
You would say, it's pretty, pretty cold,

780
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
isn't it?

781
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
And you wouldn't take advice from him, wouldn't you?

782
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,640
Would you take advice from somebody who fixed it in two days?

783
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,640
Or for somebody who couldn't fix it in 10 years?

784
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
Would you take advice on how to fix it?

785
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
Who would you choose from?

786
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
Ha!

787
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,640
Simply just people indulging their own weakness.

788
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
So see, they haven't got anywhere,

789
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
not because they like faculties,

790
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
not because they like support,

791
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,640
not because they like health,

792
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
because they like determination,

793
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,640
they like faith,

794
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,640
they like clarity,

795
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
they like to fight enlightenment factors.

796
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,640
And then they indulge in,

797
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,640
then they make that to be the goal,

798
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,640
like not getting anywhere,

799
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,640
is the goal of the practice.

800
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,640
Certainly it's not a goal of the Buddhist practice.

801
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Because if they were,

802
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,640
he would have said so.

803
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,640
He would have not said entirely the opposite thing.

804
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
Ha!

805
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,640
So...

806
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,640
As soon as the monks,

807
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,640
they were quite,

808
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,640
not quite clear maybe,

809
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,640
but there was some knowledge

810
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,640
who attained what,

811
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,640
maybe things were spoken up.

812
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
But now this goal is to know if she is spoken.

813
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Yes, there's nothing there.

814
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
And they just hope that other people will assume

815
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,640
what they're hopeful,

816
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,640
but the only reason they don't speak about attainment

817
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
is because they don't know what they are.

818
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,640
If they don't know what they will be speaking about it,

819
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,640
because that's just along the lines of Dhamma.

820
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,640
So, should we actually

821
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,640
the book question?

822
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,640
Of course not about this thing.

823
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,640
Yeah, you should be careful.

824
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,640
You should be careful in terms of,

825
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,640
some people in the past have used it

826
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,640
and used it to gain the offerings and so on.

827
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,640
But, no, of course it should not be.

828
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
I mean, it's a personal thing.

829
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,640
And then they won't tell you,

830
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,640
because you're just asking casually,

831
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,640
and that's not a casual thing.

832
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
But, no, of course it's not, you know.

833
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,640
Well, like if you were to book,

834
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,640
the book wouldn't have spoken about it.

835
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,640
Also, for the environment of practice,

836
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,640
so the panel basically can practice

837
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,640
for attainment of the environment.

838
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
It can be in the family,

839
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,640
it can be in the workspace,

840
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,640
not anymore.

841
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,640
So, theoretically, yes.

842
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,640
But, in the Buddhist time,

843
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,640
because in those days,

844
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,640
the world hasn't been proliferated

845
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,640
as much as it is today.

846
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,640
The availability of destruction,

847
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,640
the freedom from fear,

848
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,640
anxiety, sickness,

849
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,640
aging deference,

850
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,640
you were all kind of sheltered from it.

851
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
It's all quickly covered, it's all quickly fixed.

852
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
It's all quickly sort of painted over.

853
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,640
Plus all the destruction,

854
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,640
the majority, many fold,

855
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,640
ways of getting it,

856
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,640
as absolutely.

857
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,640
So, we require the effort to step back

858
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,640
from the pool of the world and society.

859
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,640
Too much effort.

860
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,640
You have a lot of effort.

861
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,640
We require too much effort for today's person.

862
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,640
Back in the day,

863
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,640
when the world did not have as much pool

864
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,640
in terms of its proliferation,

865
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,640
in terms of its diversification,

866
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,640
then, yeah, they could have.

867
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,640
For those who wanted to send down

868
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:15,640
or had asked me,

869
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,640
Nirvana, what's the duration to do?

870
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,640
Well, they lived the world.

871
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,640
They had to leave the laylife.

872
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,640
You can't be a layman, and expect it to.

873
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,640
It was hard back.

874
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
In the Buddhist day, they would say,

875
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,640
oh, laylife is crowded and dusty,

876
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,640
and we have so much to do,

877
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,640
and so many responsibilities we can't practice down there.

878
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,640
Imagine today.

879
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,640
Imagine today.

880
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
It's just a mess of clutter.

881
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,640
It's absolutely not possible.

882
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,640
It's just a mess of clutter.

883
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,640
Sure, it doesn't need to put the role.

884
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,640
Like, there's nothing special with the ropes.

885
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,640
It's just an external statement.

886
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640
But what a layperson needs to do is

887
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,640
justically change their living environment.

888
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,640
Ah, not leave as a common layperson.

889
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,640
And today,

890
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,640
in pretty much practically speaking,

891
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,640
the way to change that environment

892
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,640
is to find a forest monastery.

893
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,640
If you can do it by as a layman,

894
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,640
going, yeah, sure,

895
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
you can, and it is possible.

896
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,640
But, yeah, I think it's important to

897
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,640
recognize the back in the Buddhist day

898
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,640
was hard as a layperson.

899
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,640
20,000 years later,

900
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,640
it's virtually impossible.

901
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,640
And the effort doesn't mean

902
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,640
that they have to sit like many hours meditation.

903
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,640
Yeah.

904
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,640
They try to read a sutra

905
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,640
and try to understand,

906
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,640
at least, the position,

907
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
and everything.

908
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,640
The effort means they have to sit for many hours,

909
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
trying to understand the meaning of done.

910
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,640
Many hours.

911
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,640
Many days, many times.

912
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,640
But if they actually spend the time sitting

913
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,640
doing a meditation technique,

914
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,640
well, they'll be better off as a generous layman.

915
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,640
They'll be less misguided, probably.

916
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,640
Just as a layman who doesn't try to practice done,

917
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,640
but it's just been generous in virtues.

918
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,640
But instead of if they sit,

919
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,640
cross like watching the nostril observing the belly,

920
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,640
they should sit for many hours,

921
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,640
or walk for many hours,

922
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,640
and keep doing the understanding of dharma.

923
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,640
What are the factors?

924
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,640
Understand the nature of the factors?

925
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,640
You'll be free from them.

926
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
What are the following virtues?

927
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640
See the following virtues?

928
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
See the principle of them?

929
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
You will be realizing them.

930
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
But that won't happen by itself.

931
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,640
That won't happen if you sit cross like,

932
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
and watch a breath.

933
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
Or do any other.

934
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
So the main thing we have to learn

935
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,640
is really how to contemplate,

936
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,640
because people can go to another extreme,

937
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,640
some iteration, but didn't do it in the entire thing.

938
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,640
Yeah, of course.

939
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Yeah, when I say try to understand,

940
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,640
I don't mean like doing scholarly work,

941
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,640
and fixing all the declinations of Pali,

942
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,640
all the time.

943
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,640
I mean actually try to understand the nature of things.

944
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,640
So you can see how,

945
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,640
well, it sounds very vague to people.

946
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,640
And the reason for that is because the thinking

947
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,640
is so far removed from any form of correct thinking,

948
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,640
and just the concept of thinking is,

949
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,640
it seems so vague.

950
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,640
Also, what do I think about?

951
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,640
Give me an object, you know.

952
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,640
An object is really subtle, that's the object.

953
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,640
Yeah, that's what people struggle.

954
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,640
They think like,

955
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,640
what has to be the object of my thought then?

956
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,640
Because they can't comprehend thinking

957
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,640
without a clearly defined object.

958
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,640
It's like, well,

959
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,640
think about the nature of your sense-basis.

960
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,640
You see how ambiguous that is for most people.

961
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,640
The more ambiguous it is,

962
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,640
the more far removed from it you are.

963
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,640
But you won't fix that by

964
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,640
sort of finding a completely different object

965
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,640
to think about.

966
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,640
You'll fix it by thinking about an ambiguity,

967
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,640
trying to clarify.

968
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,640
Ready the suitors?

969
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,640
Get the info you can?

970
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,640
Relate, think about it,

971
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
and then if you become clear,

972
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,640
you start discerning your experience

973
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
why?

974
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
Because you're making the effort to discerning.

975
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,640
But if you don't make the effort to discerning,

976
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,640
if you make effort to do some,

977
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,640
I don't know, mechanical technique,

978
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,640
or to be thinking about a particular mantra

979
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,640
or something else,

980
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,640
because you'll never descend the ambiguity

981
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
of your senses,

982
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,640
or of your nature of the soul,

983
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
or anything of feelings,

984
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,640
to that matter.

985
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,640
Yeah.

986
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,640
So it's ambiguous only because it's not clear.

987
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,640
And it's all clear,

988
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,640
because there's never

989
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,640
any effort made towards clarification of it.

990
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,640
So, and then, actually, you know,

991
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,640
for someone who is aiming

992
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,640
from high developments of the pana,

993
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,640
you would say that actually

994
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,640
complete seclusion is necessary,

995
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,640
giving more away from distractions.

996
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,640
For an authentic person, yes.

997
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,640
For a person who's not running away from things,

998
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,640
but for a person who's actively making the effort

999
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,640
in overcoming them.

1000
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,640
You're talking about from sort of a dilemma.

1001
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,640
Oh, sorry, I'm talking about a dilemma.

1002
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,640
Sorry.

1003
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,640
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,640
Yeah, if somebody's already discerning the pana,

1005
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,640
if they want to become, yeah.

1006
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Yeah, he has to be.

1007
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,640
Again, back in the day,

1008
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,640
it would have been maybe possible

1009
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,640
living in the outskirts,

1010
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,640
depending on the village,

1011
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,640
depending on the village,

1012
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,640
and so on,

1013
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,640
and kind of having interaction with us.

1014
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,640
But I think even back then,

1015
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,640
to put a cap sort of resorting months,

1016
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,640
there are empty hearts,

1017
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,640
there are empty roots of trees,

1018
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,640
empty forests,

1019
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,640
empty jungle, basically.

1020
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,640
You have to.

1021
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,640
So, today, imagine how much more you have to do that.

1022
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,640
Back then, you can go for a retreat like that,

1023
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,640
to the work,

1024
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,640
and then, you know,

1025
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,640
come back to a more comfortable setting.

1026
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,640
But today, I think,

1027
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,640
it's very much, much more.

1028
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,640
Is there hope for our partnership

1029
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,640
with this person?

1030
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,640
Yeah, yeah.

1031
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,640
There's hope as long as there is hope

1032
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,640
that we can be safe.
