WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
So we've established that authenticity, self-honesty is very important.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Yes sir.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Yes sir.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
But it seems a sense of shame and a fear of wrongdoing.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Perhaps the Buddha also says, you know, the guardians of the world.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Guardians of the world, yeah.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Why?

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
A sense of shame, fear of wrongdoing and guilt.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Is guilt the same?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
He can be, yeah, sure.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Because it's...

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Yeah, because I think it probably would be on the same level, is it?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
But why is a sense of shame?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
It's a good thing.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Well, because he prevents you from doing bad.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Doing unwholesome.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Doing things based on sensuality.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Because if you don't have that preventing you,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
there's nothing stopping you.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
So that's why it's good to have a sense of shame even if you don't necessarily have wisdom or restraint in place.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
At least that sense of shame will keep you from becoming an animal literally,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
in terms of your behavior.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
So that's why it's the guardian of the world.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
As the Buddha said, if there were no sense of shame,

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
the suns would be sleeping with mothers and sisters and fathers with daughters,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
and it would just be like animal around the floor.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
So there is that, just that, like,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
even for a completely unenlightened mind, the sense of shame,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
at least is something that would...

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Now, obviously, you have the other extreme of, you know,

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
when people become religious and they start turning to this, like, moral commandments and repression,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
but that's not any more that sense of shame.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Like, you know, when you're ashamed of everything,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
even things that are not shameful.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
But it's this kind of natural sense of shame,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
in regard to, you know, like, nudity or body exposure

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
or, like, fluid-caused things in general.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
So with that sense of shame, there is at least some kind of rules,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
so to speak, in the world, on that natural level.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Because otherwise, yeah, everybody will just be going with everybody

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
and then you will be able to think...

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Could be client, mentally client.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
But we have, well, most people, as well as a human being,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
they have an inherent sense of shame.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
You feel when you're doing something wrong.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
And yet, we understand.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, if you're honest, if you're authentic and self honest,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
that sense of shame, that's exactly what it becomes,

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
what reveals itself.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
And I'm not talking about the fabricated,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
like, oh, it's shameful, but it's really just kind of,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
more like a hateful attitude that people turn into,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
like, morally, judgmental and so on.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
That's more just a kind of real will and repression.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
No, if you're authentic, then exactly.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
There are things that you don't necessarily want to do with others

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
or being, like, known.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Which means, then, because you're authentic, you wouldn't be doing it.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
You're not going to try to conceal it either.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And in the same sense, the guilt for doing something wrong.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah, then you realize, instead of denying it, ignoring it,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
and say, oh, you don't hate yourself, and well, no,

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
you're accepting guilt as a result of what you've done carelessly.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
And then, next time, it will make you think twice,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
because you're not running away from the disagreeable feeling of the guilt.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
You're accepting it, and sometimes you can endure for days,

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
and then come back again and again and again for years later.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Each time it comes, each time you accept it.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
There is a...

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
It's thought-free.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
It's good to be guilt-free.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
No shit.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Well, that's true.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
It's good to be guilt-free, and the only way to be guilt-free

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
is through full accepting guilt, and then going beyond it.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Not by ignoring it or denying it.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And that is exactly the case.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
You feel that inherent sense of shame,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
but they project it and blame society for it.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
I mean, yes, society has a lot of blame, the degree of shaming,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
but there is that threshold, which is the natural shame,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
and some people, yeah, we have more of it, some people have less of it.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Certain things that will just make you uncomfortable.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
But then people find that a problem, because, yeah,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
it can be unpleasant, obviously, if it's preventing you from doing what you want to do,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
and then, yeah, you do blame society, blame the culture,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
you rebel against it, you go completely...

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
You try to override it.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
But that's completely misplaced effort.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
The better effort is actually no.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
There is a place for that natural degree of sense of shame

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
in regard to doing things that are really...

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Not...

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Not nice.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, they are inappropriate.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Because of that, and the fear of wrongdoing,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
that's why it's always bound together.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh, I don't want to do it. It's just a problem.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Like stealing, lying...

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Stealing, lying cheating.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Just being basically acting like a...

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Just following your desires in the same manner and animalhood,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
without any reflection or...

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
You know, you see dogs, I mean, they get into...

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
They get you into a village,

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
and they know they're most likely going to be attacked

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
and maybe seriously injured by all the other packed dogs.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
But they just...

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
They just saw either a female and lost perspective or food and lost perspective.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
And you know how...

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
They know how it's going to end,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
but they just have no reflection over it to consider it.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
So they just go and eat, and while they eat,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
then they get attacked, and that's it.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
And then they...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
They don't know the consequences.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, they don't know about this consequences.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
They can't factor them in,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
because the mind doesn't possess the same powers of reflection as human mind does.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
And that's why they don't have the sense of shame.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
That's why, you know, you have a puppy and a mother,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
and it's all like, oh, that's my mother.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
But once he passes it on age,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
and he starts responding to female hormones and the less insecurity,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
then he just starts seeing the mother as a female.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
It's not any more seen as a mother,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
for as long as the heat is going on and so on.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
There's no sense of shame.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
They don't perceive that.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
But for most people, they do have that recognition,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
and that sense of shame will be guarding,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
going that way.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
For most, it's not always people at difference

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
or people don't have any natural sense of shame.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
And how do you develop the sense of shame?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Well, but become self-transparent.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
And by keeping your desires in check,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
then you realize that with or without the sense of shame,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
you are the one responsible for saying yes to desires

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
and following them through.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Because it doesn't matter what thoughts your mind

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
might be presenting in forms of desire,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
possibilities for things you want to do.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
That doesn't matter.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
What matters is you're accepting to do it or not,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
and then following through and doing it.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Or not.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
So that's self-honesty.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Self-honesty.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
You don't blame the society.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
You don't blame government.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
You don't blame your genes.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Or that's how I was born.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Because even if all those things are in play,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
you, in the present moment,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
is always responsible.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I always respond to the society.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
The reflection of that.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
The consequences.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
The reflection of the consequences.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, that can help, but not necessarily.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
It's like saying, you know,

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
people try to give up some addiction.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
They can reflect on consequences,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
but when the addiction present,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
they don't see consequences relevant

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
on the same level as what the addiction is.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
But if you're self-honesty,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
you realize you would be able to allow

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
whatever pressing desire arises.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
You would be allowed to arise

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
and having now space to not give it in.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Or be kind of occupied.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
But that takes that you have to start seeing benefit

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
even in that initially strength.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
If you don't, then there is no,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
there won't be enough.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Well, there won't be enough ground for any property.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Because without that restrained beforehand,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
you won't be able to allow desire

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
to come close without you acting upon it.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
As soon as that coming, you'll be acting upon it.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
But the restrained will prevent it.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
It doesn't mean it's going to make things,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
well, it will make things nicer and easier

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
and more peaceful later on.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
The mind grows out of it.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Well, it grows from it.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
But until then, it's actually yet

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
it's going to reveal the pain on the lying pain

08:24.000 --> 08:50.000
beneath the desire and the lack of restraint.
