WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.720
Okay, so we thought of doing a short, or not so short, series on the Nyanavira Telestichis,

00:21.720 --> 00:26.600
specifically on his notes and Dhamma book.

00:26.600 --> 00:31.680
And Venera Paine Ratan is behind the camera, so he's going to ask some questions that are

00:31.680 --> 00:37.280
usually what people ask us about Nyanavira, starting from preface and then going through

00:37.280 --> 00:41.080
different notes of that book.

00:41.080 --> 00:48.160
So also, if the viewers have any questions about Nyanavira teachings regarding this particular

00:48.160 --> 00:52.720
series, they can ask in the comment section and then we can probably include it in some

00:52.720 --> 00:55.320
future videos.

00:55.320 --> 01:02.040
So yeah, we're going to start with preface and then move onwards with other notes, especially

01:02.040 --> 01:07.560
the ones that usually people have problems grasping them or understanding, or there's

01:07.560 --> 01:10.120
some lack of clarity or something like that.

01:10.120 --> 01:17.480
So I'll start us off with just reading a section from the first paragraph of the preface.

01:17.480 --> 01:26.120
He writes, there is therefore nothing in these pages to interest the professional scholar

01:26.120 --> 01:31.280
for whom the question of personal existence does not arise, for the scholar's whole concern

01:31.280 --> 01:36.000
is to eliminate or ignore the individual point of view in an effort to establish an objective

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
truth.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.080
It would be impersonal synthesis of public facts.

01:41.080 --> 01:47.280
The scholar is essentially a horizontal few of things seeking connections in space and time

01:47.280 --> 01:52.800
and his historical approach to the texts disqualify him, many possibility of understanding the

01:52.800 --> 01:57.480
Dhamma that the Buddha himself has called Akalika, or timeless.

01:57.480 --> 02:02.880
Only in a vertical view, straight down into the abyss of his personal existence is a man

02:02.880 --> 02:09.360
capable of apprehending the perilous insecurity of his situation and only a man who does apprehend

02:09.360 --> 02:13.640
this is prepared to listen to the Buddha's teaching.

02:13.640 --> 02:21.160
So it can be a bit confusing about the idea of having two different kinds of thinking,

02:21.160 --> 02:27.920
like what exactly it is that distinguishes a horizontal kind of thinking as he's saying

02:27.920 --> 02:30.360
versus a vertical kind of thinking.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.560
Could you elaborate more on that?

02:33.560 --> 02:42.200
Well in brief, the main difference is the vertical thinking is the thinking done through

02:42.200 --> 02:43.800
your existence.

02:43.800 --> 02:49.960
So you do that thinking arises on the basis, literally on the basis of anxiety, existential

02:49.960 --> 02:53.200
dread, recognition of your human situation.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.640
That's where the Buddha would often refer in the suttas as a young man would get disillusioned

02:58.640 --> 03:04.600
with life and then he would ponder on human situation and he would recognize this human

03:04.600 --> 03:10.280
life he's subject to suffering, you would pray to suffering, I mean suffering is this

03:10.280 --> 03:16.440
invisible hunter that can pounce on you at any time and you can't do anything about it.

03:16.440 --> 03:22.080
So the main, that's the prerequisite, that attitude is a prerequisite towards the existential

03:22.080 --> 03:25.240
understanding and then towards the right practice of Dhamma.

03:25.240 --> 03:29.800
So that's what Janiro is talking about, when you're not trying to overcome any particular

03:29.800 --> 03:34.200
issue that you might have in your life, but really understanding the nature of a human

03:34.200 --> 03:39.560
deal and not being satisfied with it.

03:39.560 --> 03:45.040
So that's why you cannot approach practice correctly as a scholar or as somebody who

03:45.040 --> 03:54.240
just merely collecting information about the Dhamma, but you really need to make it not

03:54.240 --> 04:01.840
optional for yourself in order to be able to do it rightly.

04:01.840 --> 04:08.440
So that's what he meant because often people approach the suttas, approach the study mostly

04:08.440 --> 04:14.480
for the scholarly value as in collecting the data, collecting information, drawing the

04:14.480 --> 04:23.800
parallels in time and space and sort of rationalizing it, but not really approaching it on the

04:23.800 --> 04:31.840
basis of that personal necessity of practice, in which case it's not optional anymore and

04:31.840 --> 04:37.400
you really need to understand what the Buddha was teaching in order to be free from the

04:37.400 --> 04:41.280
existential era.

04:41.280 --> 04:46.600
So what is it about this vertical view that also made it the timeless view as opposed

04:46.600 --> 04:50.520
to the horizontal one that's looking at connections and space time?

04:50.520 --> 04:58.600
Well, as the Buddha said, the suffering has a presently arisen cause of craving, which

04:58.600 --> 05:03.600
means that the freedom from suffering, freedom from possibility to suffer, which is suffering

05:03.600 --> 05:12.360
in itself, is to be found in the present moment, but not in that kind of a contemporary mystified

05:12.360 --> 05:17.520
notion of just being the present, but in understanding that pertains to the present

05:17.520 --> 05:22.600
moment as in understanding the cause of that suffering that's here presently, simultaneously

05:22.600 --> 05:26.640
arisen with that suffering.

05:26.640 --> 05:33.920
So that is, that's what Nyanavir Atera described as a vertical view into your own being as

05:33.920 --> 05:40.880
opposed to that horizontal view of you assuming or rationalizing before and after and in between

05:40.880 --> 05:45.760
and left or right, not seeing present there isn't suffering simultaneously through that

05:45.760 --> 05:48.240
you see present there isn't craving.

05:48.240 --> 05:52.480
And you know that with the absence of that craving, suffering cannot stand even for a

05:52.480 --> 05:54.200
second longer.

05:54.200 --> 05:59.980
And that's why to be known individually, as in vertically, personally, by the wise,

05:59.980 --> 06:04.560
dhamma that's timeless in that sense, it does not involve a passage of time, that direct

06:04.560 --> 06:08.080
insight doesn't involve it.

06:08.080 --> 06:14.160
People in the modern day like neuroscientists and psychologists and stuff, they also try

06:14.160 --> 06:21.040
and study suffering, study, maybe apply their fields to the Buddha's teaching.

06:21.040 --> 06:26.520
Are they using that vertical view or are they divorced from that in some way?

06:26.520 --> 06:34.680
Well, they're divorced from that long time ago, when they sort of gave the unquestioned

06:34.680 --> 06:42.720
validity to the scientific method, because science in itself negates the observer.

06:42.720 --> 06:47.960
But certainly that's the starting premise.

06:47.960 --> 06:53.080
Later on they might try to factor in the observer, but only through that scientifically assumed

06:53.080 --> 06:58.760
external public world of matter, and then you try to re-include the observer, but you fail

06:58.760 --> 07:03.280
to see that the observer was the one who was first.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.040
He was the one who decided to look for these particular things and develop science out

07:07.040 --> 07:12.480
of it, which means you can't use them that science to explain the tools of your perception

07:12.480 --> 07:18.080
of your feeling, of your point of view, that as an observer you're inseparable from.

07:18.080 --> 07:23.920
Yet that whole domain, that whole sphere, disappears in science, and when it's included,

07:23.920 --> 07:26.040
it's included as a second best.

07:26.040 --> 07:31.080
So then when a modern science talks about Buddhism, as if they're proving the Buddha's

07:31.080 --> 07:36.080
teaching to be right, they've completely misunderstood it to begin with.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.560
Because if the scientists were truly understanding that the Buddha was right, they would have

07:39.560 --> 07:43.880
been at least, they would become at least the Sotopanna through their science, probably

07:43.880 --> 07:45.480
Arrahants as well.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.480
But they're not.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.120
They're not free from sensuality, greed, aversion, delusion, wrong view, which means

07:50.120 --> 07:53.320
when they say this is what the Buddha meant, they don't know what the Buddha meant, because

07:53.320 --> 07:58.920
only when nobody's short in a Sotopanna knows what the Buddha meant correctly.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.280
And that's one of the things that Venerina Luitero is always insistent upon, which is

08:03.280 --> 08:08.560
a good thing to insist on, because you might be unpleasant to admit to yourself, especially

08:08.560 --> 08:15.120
if you invested years of practice, but ultimately it can actually spur you further, because

08:15.120 --> 08:20.960
you don't make a compromise thinking to know that which you don't, and you keep striving

08:20.960 --> 08:27.760
until you reach that clarity of knowledge, which is necessary for any correct practice

08:27.760 --> 08:29.760
of Dhamma.

08:29.760 --> 08:39.160
Okay, I'll start reading now.

08:39.160 --> 08:48.880
So going for the next part to page 12 of the Roman numeral 12 of the preface, it starts

08:48.880 --> 08:55.880
existential philosophies then insist upon asking questions about self and the world,

08:55.880 --> 09:00.640
taking care at the same time to insist that they're unanswerable.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.640
Beyond this point of frustration, these philosophies cannot go.

09:04.640 --> 09:09.440
The Buddha too insists that questions about the self and the world are unanswerable, either

09:09.440 --> 09:14.080
by refusing to answer them, or by indicating that no statement about the self and the world

09:14.080 --> 09:15.680
can be justified.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.920
But, and here is the vital difference, the Buddha can and does go beyond this point, not

09:20.920 --> 09:26.560
to be sure by answering the unanswerable, but by showing the way leading to the final

09:26.560 --> 09:32.360
cessation of all questions about the self and the world.

09:32.360 --> 09:39.640
So one issue that we can sometimes have when we're trying to start reading Nenevere is

09:39.640 --> 09:46.080
it all sounds so very like kind of lofty and philosophical, you know, talking about existential

09:46.080 --> 09:48.640
ambiguity.

09:48.640 --> 09:54.680
For some, for some people it may be hard to see the connection between this vague existential

09:54.680 --> 10:00.200
problem and just, you know, the suffering I have when things don't go my way, for example.

10:00.200 --> 10:07.200
Could you, so could you talk about how suffering all does kind of come to be rooted fundamentally

10:07.200 --> 10:10.040
in this, this problem?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.600
The problem of existence.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.600
Yeah.

10:12.600 --> 10:18.800
Well, the reason why Nenevere approached it through the existential philosophy is because

10:18.800 --> 10:29.040
he himself read quite a lot of it, because he wasn't existential philosophy, likes of

10:29.040 --> 10:34.680
Slak-Sartre, Heidegger, well, even Kierkegaard is considered to be part of that.

10:34.680 --> 10:40.000
It's not really a philosophy in a sense of a system of a thought that you develop and

10:40.000 --> 10:46.680
again rationalize or idealize, but it's really in its root, obviously some of those philosophers

10:46.680 --> 10:50.960
have went further afterwards, but initially the whole point of existential philosophy

10:50.960 --> 10:58.520
was to found to be like a descriptive method of the phenomenological insight, and saying

10:58.520 --> 11:06.880
phenomenological insight, nothing other than saying mindful discernment.

11:06.880 --> 11:12.040
And that's why that philosophy was useful for a European thought, because most of the

11:12.040 --> 11:16.440
other philosophies were pretending to forget the existence of the subject as a priority

11:16.440 --> 11:20.040
as they would say existence precedes the essence.

11:20.040 --> 11:25.160
And then the whole descriptive method developed around just seeing what's present there, not

11:25.160 --> 11:27.600
developing conclusions based upon it.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.840
So that's when Nenevere picked that up as a starting point for the protugena, because

11:30.840 --> 11:36.600
that's the most you can get as a protugena to clarify the issue of your situation as

11:36.600 --> 11:44.000
highly get described in the heart of every human situation is a concern, it's fundamentally

11:44.000 --> 11:52.840
rooted upon concern, that's the most primordial aspect of human being, concern.

11:52.840 --> 11:58.240
And that's nothing other than Dukkha in itself, you're not specifically concerned about this

11:58.240 --> 12:06.440
or that, just a general, vague and biguous uneasiness, lack of ease, and that's what

12:06.440 --> 12:11.360
Dukkha means, means an absence of ease.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.960
So that's why that he would use existential philosophy to relate to the reader, because

12:16.960 --> 12:19.440
that was his background obviously.

12:19.440 --> 12:25.720
And also because it would require the person who has it to have some sort of, well at least

12:25.720 --> 12:31.440
a degree of that self awareness of their own existence, which means they won't be coming

12:31.440 --> 12:40.280
from some mystical point of view, some devotional inspiration and wanting to have the ecstasies

12:40.280 --> 12:44.520
of meditation, like how they used to translate the Jhanas and so on.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.960
So many people still have those, the residues of those notions as some sort of some transcendental

12:48.960 --> 12:55.280
projection through the Buddhist practice in some new astral realm of arahanship and similar,

12:55.280 --> 13:00.080
but it isn't, it's just freeing you from yourself, literally.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.780
Hitting you from greed, aversion, delusion, framing you from unwholesome, that's what

13:03.780 --> 13:05.440
Nibana is.

13:05.440 --> 13:12.080
So in that sense, by opting to not sort of border down the instruction, he kind of sieved

13:12.080 --> 13:17.760
out many people who would have just casually arrived at it and misunderstood it, it's

13:17.760 --> 13:19.600
no doubt about it.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.640
So that was his approach, but obviously, there was his approach, it can be different approaches,

13:23.640 --> 13:28.680
but what cannot be different is the necessity of that existential concern.

13:28.680 --> 13:33.600
As the Buddha said, a young man recognizes that he's prey to suffering, that's exactly

13:33.600 --> 13:39.400
a description of the entire existential philosophy contained just in that one line in the suttas.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.240
Imagine how would you feel if you go about every day of your life feeling your prey to

13:43.240 --> 13:47.880
a hunter that you don't know where it is, who it is, and when it's going to pass.

13:47.880 --> 13:52.520
You will feel very uneasy, and that is the definition of a human situation.

13:52.520 --> 13:58.640
So that's why people use sensuality, distraction, even anger, all the worldly projects to destroy

13:58.640 --> 14:04.240
themselves from the basic insecurity of the situation.

14:04.240 --> 14:09.040
So that's how it relates to that practice.

14:09.040 --> 14:17.440
So it sounds like it's what's more primordial than is not so much always when things do

14:17.440 --> 14:23.560
not go one's way, but the fact that maybe they could, that these philosophers were pointing

14:23.560 --> 14:27.960
at and Nyanavira was pointing at.

14:27.960 --> 14:33.640
They could go wrong, not necessarily that it does go wrong, you don't need to wait

14:33.640 --> 14:39.200
for it to go wrong, because sometimes by that time it might be too late.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.040
You want to recognize that it could go wrong, that it might go wrong, and then of course

14:43.040 --> 14:47.320
as the Buddha went step further and says well eventually it will go wrong, sickness, aging

14:47.320 --> 14:48.400
and death.

14:48.400 --> 14:54.320
But those are the ultimate examples of the human situation that can go wrong at any time.

14:54.320 --> 15:00.880
So that's why that Dukka is not like intense, acute suffering, like you're being tortured,

15:00.880 --> 15:02.520
tormented by something.

15:02.520 --> 15:06.960
It's the recognition of the possibility of being affected by suffering, and you wouldn't

15:06.960 --> 15:09.080
be able to do anything about it.

15:09.080 --> 15:15.840
And that in itself it's a cause for concern, and concern in itself is an unpleasant feeling.

15:15.840 --> 15:21.200
Thus Dukka is translated as the most general of suffering.

15:21.200 --> 15:27.440
So you've mentioned that Nyanavira borrowed heavily from an existential, phenomenological

15:27.440 --> 15:31.360
approach to his understanding of the Buddha's teaching.

15:31.360 --> 15:37.760
Do you think it's important or necessary for a person who's trying to understand the Dhamma

15:37.760 --> 15:42.800
themselves to become familiar, like start reading Sator and Heidegger and things like

15:42.800 --> 15:43.800
that?

15:43.800 --> 15:51.480
You haven't been reading it, no, no, even probably a result in wasting more time.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.960
If they're already familiar, yeah it can be helpful.

15:54.960 --> 16:00.560
But as I said, Nyanavira was referring to that, to those descriptions, to that terminology

16:00.560 --> 16:06.760
of existential phenomenology, because, well because people who ordered them to suit it

16:06.760 --> 16:11.800
could relate with greater clarity as it gives them a better starting point.

16:11.800 --> 16:18.240
So it was just efficient way, but it's not, you know, it is, as I said, either you approach

16:18.240 --> 16:23.960
it in that manner or in some other manner, one thing that a person must have is that existential

16:23.960 --> 16:27.920
concern, recognition of its own existential human situation.

16:27.920 --> 16:35.040
So if a person is aware of that and approaching Dhamma for that purpose, then they don't need

16:35.040 --> 16:37.400
to go through the existential philosophy.

16:37.400 --> 16:43.880
They just need to, well, become mindful of the feeling, the phenomenon of feeling, and

16:43.880 --> 16:48.200
mindful of the possibility of things that they might feel while they're alive, as in

16:48.200 --> 16:51.720
become mindful of the possibility of suffering.

16:51.720 --> 16:57.240
One thing that a person reading through the notes can start asking is, you know, all these

16:57.240 --> 17:02.320
descriptions of various terms we find in the suitors are great, they really make sense,

17:02.320 --> 17:13.600
they're really clarifying, but how do I start practicing, meditating, and things like that?

17:13.600 --> 17:21.200
The suit is so general, because it's been a long time ago, and the way of that oral

17:21.200 --> 17:28.160
transmission means now they're very condensed in meaning and very general in instruction,

17:28.160 --> 17:32.640
which means people can come from literally diametrically opposing angles and read the

17:32.640 --> 17:35.440
same suits differently.

17:35.440 --> 17:41.480
And you can't help that, because the Buddha is not alive anymore, as nobody there comes

17:41.480 --> 17:49.360
from that time to point you in the right direction as to how to read, that's why it is necessary

17:49.360 --> 17:54.200
to start with that existential attitude and self-awareness, because of that you won't

17:54.200 --> 17:58.400
be able to go too wrong in your misreading of the suitors, which inevitably everybody

17:58.400 --> 18:00.920
starts by misreading them.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.440
And then you realize, yeah, you can interpret it like this, you can interpret it like this,

18:04.440 --> 18:08.040
you can interpret it like this, but which one of those ways that you can interpret it really

18:08.040 --> 18:14.880
pertains to that existential suffering, that becomes your criteria for practice.

18:14.880 --> 18:21.000
So that's why it's important to develop, which is quite unpleasant, often results in

18:21.000 --> 18:26.120
anxiety and sense of dread, because otherwise a person would be sort of overly committing

18:26.120 --> 18:29.840
to a view, and then they would be reading the suitors from that point of view and then

18:29.840 --> 18:34.520
defending it and so on, and not really applying it to that existential basis.

18:34.520 --> 18:41.680
And is there a, I guess I was trying to ask, is there like a specific method or technique

18:41.680 --> 18:44.720
by which one does apply it to that place?

18:44.720 --> 18:45.720
Most certainly not.

18:45.720 --> 18:50.720
Now, if it were, the Buddha would have spoke about it, and the closest to method or technique

18:50.720 --> 18:57.760
is what the suitors tell us, develop very strange by the precepts, see the danger in

18:57.760 --> 19:05.520
the slightest fault, be moderating eating, spend your days being mindful and wakeful.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.120
As in, don't give in to distraction, don't give in to careless thoughts, that would in

19:09.120 --> 19:15.880
itself result in calmness, tranquility, that can then result in seeing things clearly and

19:15.880 --> 19:19.480
knowing exactly what you need to abandon, as in the unwholesome thoughts.

19:19.480 --> 19:25.600
Those are routine, greedy version, delusion, they are routine, distraction, and desire

19:25.600 --> 19:27.320
and craving.

19:27.320 --> 19:32.200
But yeah, there is a tendency, obviously, that what I mean, a person, if a person does

19:32.200 --> 19:40.000
not have that individual, personal, vertical criteria of existential angst and suffering

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
and possibility to suffer, it will be easy then to just give in to a promise method or

19:46.000 --> 19:48.840
a mechanical technique, they can then result.

19:48.840 --> 19:55.400
Well, you hope to result in liberation, but really, the only way you can liberate yourself

19:55.400 --> 20:01.600
is to come to grips with your own existence, Baba, and see that you are responsible for

20:01.600 --> 20:03.560
upholding it and then undo it.

20:03.560 --> 20:09.200
That's why when the narrator was often talking about undoing things.

20:09.200 --> 20:17.160
So the closest method that can result in understanding that you can come is to say you have to keep

20:17.160 --> 20:18.880
trying to understand.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.880
That's it.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.880
I can't tell you do this to this to this to this and then that will automatically result

20:22.880 --> 20:27.040
in understanding, because understanding is when you understood, based on the given data

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
and information.

20:28.040 --> 20:32.560
So you inform yourself, through Naira, through the suttas and using the personal criteria

20:32.560 --> 20:38.600
of being liable to suffering, because if you understood things correctly, that liability

20:38.600 --> 20:42.800
to suffering should be diminishing and you will see directly.

20:42.800 --> 20:47.680
That's why Sotapana, somebody who has reached that first stage, knows exactly what suffering

20:47.680 --> 20:53.960
is, what origin of suffering is, what cessation is, and what to do to develop that cessation.

20:53.960 --> 20:54.960
He's not guessing anymore.

20:54.960 --> 20:59.880
He has a direct knowledge into that.

20:59.880 --> 21:06.840
So to reiterate then, for one who's trying to develop this proper attitude and is trying

21:06.840 --> 21:16.040
to undertake a study of the suttas and the notes on Dhamma, what is then the proper place

21:16.040 --> 21:21.000
of these notes in that pursuit?

21:21.000 --> 21:31.800
Well, the notes are sort of, well first of all, they need to live restrained by the precepts.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.400
Depending on how far they want to go in their understanding, either fiber, but ideally eight

21:35.400 --> 21:40.640
precepts, which means whether you are reading the notes or reading the suttas, if you don't

21:40.640 --> 21:45.960
have the basic virtue being developed, maintained through your practice of mindfulness and samadhi

21:45.960 --> 21:49.080
that comes out of it, no amount of understanding will take place.

21:49.080 --> 21:53.680
It will all be in the abstract scholastic theory.

21:53.680 --> 22:01.680
So the place of notes is for somebody who does live restrained and wants the work laid out

22:01.680 --> 22:05.880
for them, as in what needs to be understood.

22:05.880 --> 22:10.160
Some people can handle more of it, some people less, but the point is you do need to understand

22:10.160 --> 22:12.880
at least a degree of the Buddhist teaching.

22:12.880 --> 22:18.920
So the notes could help you develop that right attitude towards the suttas, how to read them.

22:18.920 --> 22:23.480
Whether you would read them just as an Indian folklore, a social commentary of the times,

22:23.480 --> 22:29.240
a loose compilation of the Buddhist utterances, or you're going to read them as the strictest,

22:29.240 --> 22:37.840
condensed, and most universal, as in general, phenomenological description of your experience.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.320
Because if you start reading them like that with that attitude, you realize, yeah, all

22:42.320 --> 22:47.720
it takes is to understand fully one sutta and you can be another hunter to encounter it.

22:47.720 --> 22:52.600
If you approach them as a folklore, then you can have it all, makes no difference.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.320
But if you approach them actually as a direct description of something that universally present

22:56.320 --> 23:00.960
in every human experience, it means then that you need to see it in order to understand

23:00.960 --> 23:02.920
that sutta.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.880
So that was one of the examples that really kind of, I didn't realize that, because when

23:06.880 --> 23:10.080
I was a layman, I was reading the suttas and I found them useful, but I didn't quite

23:10.080 --> 23:15.760
understand, well, their extent, their importance, until I came across in a era who, but by that

23:15.760 --> 23:20.880
time I was reading lots of sattra, hide the gear, and other philosophy, being in time,

23:20.880 --> 23:22.480
being in nothingness.

23:22.480 --> 23:28.120
So I could read philosophy and I had no trouble following it, and I was quite familiar with

23:28.120 --> 23:29.120
it.

23:29.120 --> 23:34.520
So there was one bit when Janavira mentioned he gives this entire quote from sattra, or

23:34.520 --> 23:40.640
hide the gear, maybe, the entire page, about a human situation and so on, about the senses

23:40.640 --> 23:42.160
and sense perception.

23:42.160 --> 23:47.760
And I remember I read that quote many times, so he felt like, oh, yeah, this is very useful.

23:47.760 --> 23:52.000
And then he says, or for example, as the Buddha would say, so he compares what this like

23:52.000 --> 23:57.200
pages of this philosophy said, compares, and he was just like one line from the suttas.

23:57.200 --> 24:02.800
Then I read many times, but he never occurred to me to read it in such a heavily condensed

24:02.800 --> 24:05.640
manner, to give it that kind of importance.

24:05.640 --> 24:10.560
But then I realized, well, actually, I should be giving it that kind of importance, because

24:10.560 --> 24:15.920
that's how people at the end of a discourse, discourse by the Buddha, would have become

24:15.920 --> 24:21.680
utterance, or at least sotupanas, and then we read it today, we wonder why there's nothing

24:21.680 --> 24:24.840
happening to me, because you're not reading it rightly.

24:24.840 --> 24:29.880
If you approach every single line to be condensed with meaning, not in that scholastic sort

24:29.880 --> 24:34.960
of investigation of the information and connections with other passages and so on, but genuinely

24:34.960 --> 24:40.640
just what it actually is, what is describing it phenomenologically, what is being described

24:40.640 --> 24:44.680
by it, phenomenologically, as in presently right here, right now.

24:44.680 --> 24:49.320
And if you approach it like that, then you realize, yeah, one sutta, fully understood,

24:49.320 --> 24:51.840
can certainly result in the right view.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.280
As I just gave the example, like when the Buddha, I mean, many of us, would have just

24:55.280 --> 25:01.640
read over that line when the Buddha says, a young man feels he's prey to suffering, subject

25:01.640 --> 25:04.280
to suffering, so he goes forth into homeless life.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.040
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.960
But if you stop and think about it, just that, just those two words, three words, prey to

25:10.960 --> 25:17.920
suffering, contains the entire existential philosophy, volumes and volumes of work, centuries of

25:17.920 --> 25:20.160
phenomenological development, it's all in that attitude.

25:20.160 --> 25:25.960
That's all the existential philosophy concern about, experiencing concern in regard to the

25:25.960 --> 25:30.440
basic nature of your existence, yet the Buddha just included in the first line of every other

25:30.440 --> 25:32.160
sutta.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.480
But then you realize, hold on.

25:33.480 --> 25:37.280
So if I read the rest of this sutta, I have to have that attitude then, because he would

25:37.280 --> 25:43.080
go further, that man who would feel he's prey to suffering, goes into homeless life, finds

25:43.080 --> 25:47.120
a teaching, applies himself, and then becomes another.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.120
But that's what I mean.

25:48.120 --> 25:52.480
So you can, you can say, no, it was just a social commentary, and you can't debate that

25:52.480 --> 25:57.400
because there is no proof in between or a living person who can say, no, you're right, you're

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
wrong.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.000
But then you ask yourself, well, why do you practice?

26:02.000 --> 26:06.600
Is it because some sort of cultural enrichment or gathering data or scholastic development

26:06.600 --> 26:09.520
or is it for freedom from suffering?

26:09.520 --> 26:14.600
Then you recognize that, well, scholastic understanding, social understanding, no matter how vast the

26:14.600 --> 26:18.480
net of your connection develops, does not free you from suffering.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.880
But phenomenological understanding, the present there isn't cause of the present there isn't

26:21.880 --> 26:23.640
suffering does free you from.

26:23.640 --> 26:32.120
And then you can decide yourself how you want to read the sutta.

26:32.120 --> 26:40.680
One set of terms that comes up fairly often is a positive and negative.

26:40.680 --> 26:48.960
There's footnote letter N, which describes a brief quote from Soren Kierkegaard regarding

26:48.960 --> 26:56.360
the negative thinking, says, precisely because the negative is present in existence and present

26:56.360 --> 27:02.240
everywhere for existence is a constant process of becoming, it is necessary to become aware

27:02.240 --> 27:06.760
of its presence continuously as you only safeguard against it.

27:06.760 --> 27:13.240
Janavir writes, positive or abstract thinking abstracts from existence and is thus incapable

27:13.240 --> 27:16.280
of thinking continuously.

27:16.280 --> 27:22.880
So it's not, it may not be clear to many people what exactly, what is a negative and a positive

27:22.880 --> 27:26.760
kind of thinking, like those domains may not mean anything to some people.

27:26.760 --> 27:33.160
In simple terms, a negative thinker is a thinker who is aware of his own situation while thinking.

27:33.160 --> 27:38.440
He doesn't abstract the content of his thoughts from the situation, which is why it's called

27:38.440 --> 27:39.440
abstraction.

27:39.440 --> 27:45.520
So he remains aware of the background that the necessary basis for his whatever engagement

27:45.520 --> 27:46.920
might be.

27:46.920 --> 27:53.160
So that's why the negative thinker is in that it's negative in relation to the positive

27:53.160 --> 27:56.320
content of his particular thought.

27:56.320 --> 28:01.080
So he's kind of like aware of the background of his act of thinking or speaking or doing

28:01.080 --> 28:04.400
things by body, aware of the peripheral.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.240
That's exactly where in the sutta, that's exactly where the development of mind comes

28:07.240 --> 28:13.440
down to, practice of samadhi, practice of jhanas, developing the sphere of that peripheral and

28:13.440 --> 28:21.960
thus overcoming the particular domains of sensuality, ill will and so on.

28:21.960 --> 28:30.200
So then when one is trying to understand these notes, is it that negative kind of thinking

28:30.200 --> 28:34.800
through which they have to be understood as opposed to the positive thinking that one

28:34.800 --> 28:35.800
may be used to?

28:35.800 --> 28:39.440
Well, it's not something you can, negative thinking, not something you can jump into

28:39.440 --> 28:40.440
by choice.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.320
So it needs to be developed.

28:42.320 --> 28:46.760
So by trying to understand what negative thinking is, what the negative thinker is,

28:46.760 --> 28:48.520
that's how you begin to develop it.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.520
So that's what I mean.

28:49.520 --> 28:54.760
If you approach it just through like a positive comparison and scholastic study and so on,

28:54.760 --> 28:56.800
you're not going to understand the notes.

28:56.800 --> 29:01.680
But if you approach it because you want solution to the existential problem of liability to

29:01.680 --> 29:08.240
suffering, then you will start to understand that because you will be reading them increasingly

29:08.240 --> 29:11.000
more rightly, so to speak.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.200
And that's what I mean, the virtue, the restraint, the sensory strength and the establishment

29:16.200 --> 29:20.400
of virtue and the precepts needs, it's not negotiable, needs to come first and needs

29:20.400 --> 29:25.320
to be maintained beforehand as well.

29:25.320 --> 29:28.200
Which means then you took it on as your lifestyle.

29:28.200 --> 29:33.800
The whole approach to them are not just something you might do on the weekend or occasionally

29:33.800 --> 29:35.800
on an online floor.

29:35.800 --> 29:42.600
At the end of the preface he talks about this fundamental structure, which is at the back

29:42.600 --> 29:44.480
of the notes on Dhamma.

29:44.480 --> 29:51.440
A lot of people have many questions and are very interested in mathematical appearance.

29:51.440 --> 29:55.080
Do you think that's something that's important for understanding the Buddhist teaching?

29:55.080 --> 29:57.280
No, absolutely not.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.760
As the animator Thérrez himself said, it's just an instrument of thought that he himself

30:01.760 --> 30:09.280
found very useful, but you can't really think fundamental structure in phenomenological terms.

30:09.280 --> 30:15.320
Because you are the structure, your experience, the pancha, pancha, pancha, but I can't,

30:15.320 --> 30:17.880
the five aggregates, is your experience.

30:17.880 --> 30:22.720
So what he deals there with, he deals with the description of the structure, which would

30:22.720 --> 30:27.880
require you to have an external view to it, which you can't.

30:27.880 --> 30:31.760
So in order to describe it, you must give up the phenomenological method.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.760
If you give a phenomenological method, you're not talking about existence anymore.

30:34.760 --> 30:39.000
That's what he felt it as an instrument, as a justification for reflexive thinking and

30:39.000 --> 30:41.560
so on, as an explanation for it.

30:41.560 --> 30:49.560
But in terms of somebody needing to understand it, or something, it's not necessarily completely.

30:49.560 --> 30:55.920
Because also, you cannot factor in that structure, which is the problem of science as well.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.480
They meet the same problem, which is when you assume the external point of view to your

30:59.480 --> 31:03.640
experience, you can't factor in the feeling, the domain of feeling.

31:03.640 --> 31:07.840
I mean, you can represent it on the paper, but that's not being felt right there and

31:07.840 --> 31:08.840
then.

31:08.840 --> 31:13.720
So in that sense, feeling is always present, but you remember the past feeling, the future

31:13.720 --> 31:16.560
feeling, the present feeling, you feel it presently.

31:16.560 --> 31:21.920
Hence the Buddha said, my teachings for the one who feels, who knows how to feel.

31:21.920 --> 31:28.320
So that's why I wouldn't, unless you already have a starting point that allows you to relate

31:28.320 --> 31:34.760
to fundamental structure and kind of just enrich the instrument of your thinking, that's fine.

31:34.760 --> 31:38.320
But otherwise, you'd be just wasting time.

31:38.320 --> 31:43.240
I think he included it because it is quite unique.

31:43.240 --> 31:47.680
And for somebody who was in philosophy and phenomenology, yeah, it's a very interesting

31:47.680 --> 31:53.680
and useful thing in that semi-scholastic semi-phenomenological sense.
