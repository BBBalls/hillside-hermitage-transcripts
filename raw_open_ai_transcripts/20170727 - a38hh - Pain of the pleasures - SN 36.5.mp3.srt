1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,440
So these suitors are from the Samyutani Kaya, the connected discourses, and this is a

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,600
chapter on feelings.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:28,640
And this suit is called should be seen, because there are these three feelings, what three

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,240
pleasant feelings — painful feelings — neither painful nor pleasant feelings.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,640
Pleasant feelings — Bros. Beku's should be seen as painful.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,760
Painful feelings should be seen as a dart — neither painful nor pleasant feelings should

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,360
be seen as impermanent.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,840
When Beku's ability had seen pleasant feeling as painful or painful as a dart in neither

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,400
painful nor pleasant feeling as impermanent, he's called a beggar who sees rightly, he

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,560
cut off craving severed the fetters by completely breaking through conceit. He has made an end to suffer.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,640
One who has seen the pleasant as painful and the painful as a dart, seen as impermanent

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,200
the peaceful feeling, neither painful nor pleasant, he is a bicker who sees rightly one who fully understands

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,080
feelings. Having understood feelings, he is tankless in this very life, standing in the dharma

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
with the body's breakup, the knowledge master cannot be readied.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,720
That's what I was saying this morning, in relation to central pleasures,

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:53,280
that seeing centrality as painful, the centre, the centre, the core of a central desire

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:01,680
that is always regarded as pleasurable, that can't tip, that satisfaction, seeing that as painful

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,440
in a sense of understanding, that pleasure to be the pain, not denying the fact that it's

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,280
initially to see this pleasurable, that will free one from central cravings, and then

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,160
applying the same principle onto the nature-feeling in general whereby whatever is being felt

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,080
you regard as disagreeable because it was felt, and that's pretty much what this sutra says.

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,800
You regard pain, sorry, you regard pleasure as pain, pain as even more as dart,

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,440
and you are feeling the peaceful feeling you understand. It cannot be controlled, it cannot be

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:56,240
owned thus, it's impermanent, it has a reason, it's impermanent, and I said that this morning,

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,400
that's the difference, if you do that then basically you'll free yourself from conceded further

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,520
towards our country, as opposed to if you just do the same principle, but in regard to the

27
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,960
particular essential pleasure, it will free you from sensuality,

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,280
but now you have to take that application onto the general level of the nature of feelings,

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,040
whether it's being held, and they will free you from conceded, from the sense of I am.

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,080
And this sutra refers to that second freeing self from conceded, the whole thing.

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
Obviously, if it just feels out from conceded, you may free from sexuality as well.

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:45,840
But this is right to see, and to see pleasant feeling as painful,

33
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,440
because it is pleasant, so what is the painfulness of it?

34
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,720
Then it's pleasant, then it's self, it's afflicting you.

35
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,080
See, when you ask that, you expect you to find pain in relation

36
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,080
or somewhere else from that pleasure, but okay, so it's pleasant, but what is pain in there?

37
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
The pleasure, it's the pain.

38
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,520
Nothing left to write up or down from it, it's that very pleasure that is painful,

39
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,920
and that is not seen directly.

40
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:27,040
Why is it painful? It's because it's... Well, see, the reason you ask why,

41
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,240
is because you still don't know, you're still doubting it that it's painful,

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,640
which means you're not seeing it as painful, thus you're asking why is it painful, how is it painful?

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,680
But any of the answers will not make it clearer.

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,720
Any of the answers will not make it, will not make you see directly.

45
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,240
But I can give you an answer once you see directly.

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
Well, you can give an answer once you see directly,

47
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
but you have to be careful when you give an answer, because then there's a person

48
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,240
I think they understand the answer without seeing it directly.

49
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,480
But if you want to be accurate in describing it, it's what the sutra says.

50
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
That pleasure is pain.

51
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,040
Not knowing that, you perceive it as pleasure.

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:21,840
Like a leper regarding burning coals as pleasurable, while they were actually always painful,

53
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,360
or like the actual perception of it was also always very disagreeable.

54
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,800
But you have to say to yourself, yeah, as investigating it.

55
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,680
As investigating it, you basically first have to see that pleasure for what it is.

56
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,080
And then, while it's simultaneously present, you have to simultaneously,

57
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,360
while pleasure is there, you have to regard it as disagreeable, as painful, as dangerous.

58
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,720
Another similar I was explaining to you this morning was the trap.

59
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,840
For as long as you don't see the deadly trap hidden in it,

60
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
it's meant solely for you to catch you,

61
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,520
you will still regard aspects of that bait as agreeable.

62
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Even if sometimes you might suspect that there is a trap,

63
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,640
the fact that you are not sure, the fact that you don't see it,

64
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,760
it would be enough for you to still regard some aspects of that bait as agreeable,

65
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
as desirable, as attractive.

66
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,160
But if suddenly the danger becomes apparent,

67
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,600
if you see what kind of trap it is, whereby even if you just stand and look at it,

68
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,200
you are at the danger of being trapped, let alone if you engage with it,

69
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,600
then you will not want anything to do with any part of it.

70
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,920
So, before it was pleasant, that trap, because you didn't know it was a trap.

71
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
But it was always a trap.

72
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,640
Now you know it's a trap and any desire towards it, it's absolutely gone,

73
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
because you know it results in a certain death.

74
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,800
That's a surely.

75
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,400
So rather than trying to explain to you why it is a trap,

76
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,760
you really want to allow that phenomenon of that pleasure of that bait,

77
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,000
whatever it is, to rise for what it is, obviously, without engaging with the priority strength present.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,200
So if thoughts arise, you have to see them for what they are,

79
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,600
you have to let that pleasure arise and then feel that pain, that it's revealed by the restraint.

80
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,800
When the mind stops trying to kind of run away from that pain that is revealed by the restraint,

81
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,400
you are left with that bait in its entirety, and then the trap can become apparent.

82
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,480
But not before your mind stops trying to avoid it,

83
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:57,040
because people practice restraint, but when things do arise on the mental level, obviously,

84
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,480
they're not engaging in unwholesome sensual activity with their body,

85
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,360
but on mental level thoughts still might arise, and then they will be feeling them,

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,080
or indulging them, they will not be understanding them.

87
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,280
So by neither feeling or indulging them, but letting them arise for what they are,

88
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,040
when you stop feeling that the risk of doing something unwholesome basically means your mind

89
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,920
has developed in regard to those thoughts, it's not an immediate pressure by them,

90
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:33,680
then you can actually see for what it is, and then you can see the agreeable as unpleasant.

91
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,320
Why? Because it's a trap. The agreeable.

92
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:45,120
It's obviously subtle because it involves perception,

93
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,280
the domain of perception, the domain of feeling.

94
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,840
You can also regard it basically, you can also regard it from a perception point of view,

95
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,040
not from the feeling point of view. From a perception point of view, it is being

96
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:07,680
that perception is perverted, so the agreeable aspect of the central perception is actually painful,

97
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,000
that might make more sense.

98
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Literally being touched by that in that manner, it's actually painful.

99
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,200
Because you touched. Because you touched full stop.

100
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,280
Because you touched by the trap. Because giving in kills you.

101
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,760
Giving in maintains you, keeps you, and matters domain.

102
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,480
Giving in makes you be reborn for EMS and EMS, and because of that,

103
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,440
direct result of that experience, every single misfortune that a mind can think of.

104
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,640
Many times.

105
00:09:48,640 --> 00:10:03,040
Because of that sweet tip of pleasure, or because of that seemingly agreeable delightful perception.

106
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:13,200
No matter how tiny or small it is, it's actually that very tiny, tiny little perception of that

107
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,000
delightfulness, that is a pain. So you have to basically start looking at that.

108
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,560
Because everything else is management. Explain to yourself why you shouldn't engage in

109
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,920
sensuality and everything. Obviously, you need it in the beginning. But only to the

110
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,040
bring you the point where you can see directly that in itself, it's actually pain.

111
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,800
Rising of sensuality of any sense, or potentially the main of any kind, it's actually pain.

112
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,680
It's actually piercing that.

113
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,480
And then perception is not perverted anymore. Again, similar to the burning coil, burning

114
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:00,480
coils. So that lapper is basically burning himself with those coils.

115
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,360
And he regards that as agreeable, while it's actually always being disagreeable.

116
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,760
But it's because of his disease, his assumptions, he never stops and thinks, hold on.

117
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Is this really agreeable? This very center of that delightful agreeable tip of the pleasure

118
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,840
really is no. The fact that it presses you in that tiny, tiny manner that are very like to the

119
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:37,200
cold. It's actually very unpleasant. It burns. Like you're touched by a rod, by a hot rod. Like you rest

120
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,200
through, but it's fine. But that bit that it touches you, it hurts. And if it's obviously if it's

121
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,640
like a tiny bit, you might not necessarily even feel the pain initially. It just feels like two

122
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,920
centers, two concentrated. But nevertheless, it is pain. If you leave it, it will longer you'll see it.

123
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:06,160
And that's what the restraint shows. Basically, when you start saying no, that pain starts to build

124
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,160
up, pain of not engaging in your desire, which is actually the pain of the touch of the desire.

125
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
Or the agreeable perception. Or the seemingly agreeable perception.

126
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,920
So obviously people who never develop their mind, they will keep regarding restraint as the reason

127
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,400
for the pain. But actually, restraint just shows you what touches you. Pain touches you. And that's

128
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,920
why you can't not give in. Mind that's not developed, can't handle pain. So when a desire touches you

129
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:47,360
and desire equals pain, when desire touches you, you need to give in, because you are too painful, too painful to not give in.

130
00:12:50,400 --> 00:13:02,000
So there is no pleasure. There is no pleasure. Pleasure is relatively marvellous. Yeah. Pleasure is

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,680
misperception, sensual pleasure, sensual joy, sensual delight. It's all the result of a version of

132
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,000
perception. Regarding that which is generally painful, regarding the touch of the painful as

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,320
pleasant. Why? There is no reason why. That's why it's gratuitous. That's why you can free yourself from it.

134
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,640
By seeing that actually this is a, this is a predispanable. You will automatically stop

135
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:37,280
regarding it as pleasant. Does any infatuation, any desire, any loss towards it, evaporates,

136
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,760
cannot possibly remain. You are saying to certain experience and agree with perception. Do you

137
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,600
have to rewriting the deception? Yes, yes. I was in there this morning. Keep applying.

138
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Are you rewriting it so to speak? Yes, or rather restoring the right order, because now it's

139
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:06,000
the better order order. So that's why I meant by rewriting. Repair it. But seeing it is painful, seeing it.

140
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,520
Yes, seeing it. But you have to first allow that agreeable perception to arise for what it is.

141
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,680
And then while that phenomenon is present, while that phenomenon is persisting, while it is changing,

142
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,720
while it is enduring in your experience, which means you are mindful of it, simultaneously

143
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:32,080
with that phenomenon, you will get that phenomenon in its entirety as painful. While pleasant as

144
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:39,920
painful, while agreeable as actually disagreeable. And that is like finding the source of infection

145
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:50,000
and right there, just applying the antibiotic, the medicine, as opposed to having the source of

146
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,080
infection still covered up with that skin or whatever else, and then you're applying. And on top of that,

147
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,720
you're applying medicine on a completely different body part. So it's not just the fine

148
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:10,400
radius, but actually have to uncover it. So you have to get to that allow that sweet, delightful

149
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,560
enticing center to appear without actually pulling in, which means the restraint, virtue,

150
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,840
sealant needs to be well established before. That's what I said. You can't let your mind be engaging

151
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,840
in distractions, even of non-central nature, because that remains the basis for sensuality,

152
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:40,080
mental mind. So when the mind is not giving in to any distractions or any kind, then all it has

153
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,920
is what's in front of it, which is basically feelings or sensuality. It's always not free from it,

154
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,920
because that those thoughts are the thoughts that are becoming up, but now you haven't been

155
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,960
running away. You haven't been obscuring them to the distraction of a different kind. And obviously

156
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,280
you haven't been compromising the restraint. The restraint of the eye faculty, nose faculty,

157
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:11,840
ear and so on, haven't been compromising sealant virtue. So basically, then that sweet

158
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,280
sting of desire in regard to side sounds, mouth taste touches that hits you, you kind of let it

159
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,320
hit you basically. Because that's not the problem. The problem is you then doing all some things

160
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,800
on account of it. But now we know you want, because all the strain and non-distraction,

161
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:37,200
so when it hits you, it's seen. Actually, this is pain, because you have no choice. You're a victim

162
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:44,560
to it hitting you. And if the mind still has the assumptions of I was hit by the pleasure,

163
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,840
so to speak, you start seeing, yeah, that pleasure is aggressive, that pleasure is pain,

164
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:58,080
that pleasure is attack, that pleasure is a track. That is not a pleasure. A desire for pleasure.

165
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,840
A desire for pleasure. Well, it's, it's almost, it's converging itself. It implies the desire,

166
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:17,360
it implies the desire. So yeah, the pleasure is the perversion. Yeah, because it did.

167
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,040
You all need to do a sit, sit down, having been restrained. Having been restrained, having

168
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,240
practiced mindfulness properly, having not been engaging in all sorts of kind of

169
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,880
mind oblivion based meditation techniques, but actually practice clarity and composure.

170
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:56,560
Then when sensual thought arises, either rises in its entirety and you see for what it is.

171
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,760
And they end up being a whole danger. They hold danger with it, but still it will have that sweet

172
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:10,000
center. That it's still just that bit. It's still okay. This is all dangerous. This is all the

173
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,400
track. You can still let yourself, but the mind still regards this pleasure. This sweet center

174
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,960
is still the track. This will sweet delightful tip of the pleasure is still the track. It's still a

175
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,680
bit of danger, but it's still regarded as sweet delightful. And then you start seeing that.

176
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,560
And when you do that, you recognize sweet delightful equals pain, sweet delightful equals pain.

177
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,440
And then you don't have to do any management because you've really approved that sting.

178
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,040
It's, it's pushed out. It doesn't actually pierce you anymore in that sense. So the wound is closed

179
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:58,320
and this thing is out of here. And like I put it says, what is pleasant here? Nothing is felt.

180
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,720
Yeah, nothing is felt. So what is pleasant in the body and that freedom, the fact that nothing

181
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:13,680
is felt is the utmost pleasure. Because you see feeling as being. And by it seems so,

182
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:27,840
you're completely drawn from it. And the mind cannot turn away towards it.

183
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,360
I think it's really hard for me to sit down and meditate usually.

184
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,960
But when I'm sitting here, I'm listening to you. At the same time, mind goes in.

185
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,680
Yeah, because that's what your meditation should be. I know, like,

186
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,080
it's hard for me to sit down and meditate. I sit down and observe my breath or do something.

187
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,840
Yeah, it's a completely wrong thing to do to begin with. What you have to do is understand what

188
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,480
the Dharma is. Then you know how to meditate. So now you're trying to meditate. No one

189
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,640
that you can't. It's actually good that you can't do it because you have less of wrong notions

190
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,600
to undo later on. But while I'm listening to you, my mind gets really disturbed.

191
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
Well, exactly. Because that's the whole point. Understanding establish your mind. Understanding

192
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,240
is meditation. That's why the Buddha always talks about only about understanding. Everything

193
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,040
culminates in understanding and wisdom. While I'm listening to you right now, I've thought of

194
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,520
moments of pleasure sexually. Yeah, moments of pleasure. Now I'm repulsed by it, like my

195
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:03,200
can physically feel repulsed by it. Because that's the reason why people don't see. The reason why

196
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,600
people maintain the perversion of perception is because the mind is not developed in regard to it.

197
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,680
The mind has never been steady. The mind has never been developed. The understanding has been

198
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:21,040
initiated. Nothing like that. So then they just carry on. So even when you go and sit and meditate,

199
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,640
you should do the same. Read a sutra before and then try to understand it in your own. That's

200
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,120
what meditation is. Like really remove any notion of any technique, any body-watching, observing

201
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,040
sensations, but not none of that. Just understanding. When you understand, then you know how to

202
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,800
continue that as practice of clarity or practice of sanity or samadhi. It's still within the same

203
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,760
right view. But if there's no right view, then you'll be just wasting your time just doing some

204
00:21:51,760 --> 00:22:00,160
other relaxation techniques, I guess. And it was the same. That's why back in the day when people

205
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,040
would hear the dharma, the mind would come down. The mind would be focused. The mind would be in samadhi.

206
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,080
Not by watching the nostrils, but by actually understanding what is being taught. Dispression,

207
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:21,840
disenchantment, cooling down, the mind. That result in a calm mind. That's just how it works.

208
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:32,880
Right now I'm really investigated on this a sensual touch. I almost feel that vomiting, right?

209
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:41,280
Well, actually, yeah. Yeah, they had the suit as well. I think tell it, they would refer to that, like

210
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,200
like you sort of, you push, what I said pushed out, but I think I read before, you kind of

211
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:59,520
you vomit it out. The sting of sensuality was kind of deep inside of you. It comes out and it's

212
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,320
done. I always like, but the way I get the signal, like when you vomit the food, you have no desire

213
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:12,320
for it anymore, once you vomit it out. And that's when you see sensuality is painful, it's vomit

214
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:20,160
the food. That's how much you want it. Zero. Even if you're really hungry, you will not be eating that.

215
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:27,520
Because it's horrible. Because it is horrible. And let alone the fact that it's very dangerous.

216
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:36,480
But the key is that as a layman as well, indulging in sensuality. You indulge and then the

217
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,720
after effect you go, they're disgusting. That was disgusting. But that's not enough. There's no

218
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,560
no, but you know, there is, there is something. You need to begin it, yeah, because most people don't

219
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:52,400
even see it as disgusting. Because you've passed what you just did. Yeah. What you did yesterday.

220
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,480
But then you forget it. Even like when you're eating, try thinking about sexual

221
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,440
integrals. It's actually disgusting while you're eating. Well, when you're not hungry anymore,

222
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,560
then the mind goes, goes towards such fantasies. But even like somebody who's not really trained

223
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,560
or developed their mind, just think while you're eating. Then you say, oh, no, I'm going to eat.

224
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:29,760
Because it's pretty horrible. And I'm like, the monkey is like the dogs. Look at that. I'm actually

225
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:38,320
not horrible. But a version of perception needs to be seen directly. Like what I said,

226
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,280
pleasure needs to be seen directly while it's present as pain. Otherwise, everything

227
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,680
else is going to be revolving around it. And it will not be approaching that center of that

228
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,360
state. It's just going to be managing it while remaining stung by it.

229
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,160
Well, this is the suit that I'm going to read now. It needs to be connected with everything you

230
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:11,920
would talk about. Also from the Samyutani Kaya. And it's called exploration.

231
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,400
So that's how I heard on one occasion, the blessed one was dwelling among the kuru's.

232
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,680
But it was a town of the kuru's name, Kamasadama. They had the blessed one dressed

233
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,800
because that's Bikus. Venerable sir, those Bikus you've played, the blessed one said this.

234
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:36,560
Do you engage in inward exploration, Bikus? When this was said, one Bikus said to the blessed one,

235
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,960
Venerable sir, I engage in inward exploration. How do you engage in inward exploration, Bikus?

236
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,720
And the Bikus then explained, but the way he explained it not satisfied the blessed one.

237
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,600
Then the Venerable and under said, now is the time for this blessed one. Now is the time for this

238
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,120
fortunate one. Let the blessed one explain inward exploration. Having heard it from the blessed one,

239
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:10,000
the Bikus will remember it. Then listen and attend closely and under, I will speak. Yes,

240
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,320
Venerable sir, the Bikus replied. The blessed one said this. Here Bikus, when engaged in inward

241
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,640
exploration, a Bikus explores thus the many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world,

242
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,680
headed by aging and death. What is the source of the suffering? What is its origin? From what is it

243
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:41,760
born and produced? When what exists does aging and death come to be? When what does not exist? Does

244
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,480
aging and death not come to be? As he explores, he understands thus the many diverse kinds of

245
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,400
suffering that arise in the world, headed by aging and death. The suffering has acquisition as its

246
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:02,000
source, acquisition as its origin. It is born and produced from acquisition. When there is acquisition,

247
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,720
aging and death comes to be. When there is no acquisition, aging and death does not come to be.

248
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:19,600
Well, just to point out before, this is what you said, it is important to understand that acquisition

249
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:32,320
means, well, loosely owning regarding things as yours, acquiring them. But it doesn't mean that

250
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,320
it's the things fault. So when people sometimes release, they think, oh, so I must not own anything

251
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,720
and they start giving away and throwing stuff. Well, you might get rid of the stuff, but the

252
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,040
acquisition as a phenomenon will still remain, which means then you will just appropriate something

253
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,840
else. You will appropriate your status of being a beggar, or your status of not owning anything

254
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,840
will be on value. So it's not so easy as to just give up your possessions in order to be free

255
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,440
from acquisition. Acquisition is based on mental assumption of possibility to own things.

256
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,520
You stop acquiring them when you realize you can't own them in the first place. It's impossible.

257
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,800
Not fully understanding that it's impossible, but that's enough for the ownership. Even if you

258
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:33,520
don't have anything practical. It continues. He also understands ageing in death,

259
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,200
it's origin, it's cessation, and the way leading on that is in conformity with his cessation.

260
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,000
He practices in that way and conducts himself accordingly. This is called the Bikku

261
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,800
is practicing for the utterly complete destruction of suffering for the cessation of ageing in death.

262
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:59,040
Then engaging further in inward exploration, he explores thus. What is the source of this acquisition?

263
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:06,000
What is its origin? From what is born, from what is it born and produced? When what exists does

264
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,880
acquisition come to be? When what is absent does acquisition not come to be? As he explores,

265
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,320
he understands thus. Acquisition has craving as its source. Craving as its origin is born and

266
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,720
produced from craving. When it's craving, acquisition comes to be. When there's no craving,

267
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,840
acquisition does not come to be. He understands acquisition, its origin, its cessation,

268
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,160
and the way leading on that is in conformity with its cessation. He practices in that way and

269
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,840
conducts himself accordingly. This is called the Bikku is practicing for the utterly complete

270
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,480
destruction of suffering for the cessation of acquisition. Then engaging further in inward

271
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,760
exploration, he explores thus. When there's craving arises, where does it arise? When it settles

272
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,000
down upon what does it settle? As he explores, he understands thus. Whatever in the world has a

273
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,800
pleasant and agreeable nature, it is here that this craving arises. When it arises, it is here that

274
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:21,680
it settles when it settles down. And what in the world has a pleasant and agreeable nature?

275
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,240
The eye has a pleasant and agreeable nature in the world. It is here that this craving arises when

276
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,240
it arises, it is here that it settles when it settles down. So to the ear and nose, the tongue,

277
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,600
the body, and the mind have a pleasant and agreeable nature, it is here that this craving arises when

278
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,600
when it arises, it is here, that it settles when it settles down.

279
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,400
Because whatever ascetics and grounds in the past,

280
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,360
regarded that in the world with the pleasant and agreeable nature

281
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,360
as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure,

282
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,760
they nurtured craving, in nurturing craving, they nurtured acquisition,

283
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,320
in nurturing acquisition, they nurtured suffering.

284
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,360
In nurturing suffering, they were not free from birth,

285
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,640
aging in death, they were not free from sorrow,

286
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,880
lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.

287
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,240
They were not free from suffering, I see.

288
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,360
So it's just another way, basically, of describing

289
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,320
that but it's on by the principle,

290
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,120
just in case people are not free.

291
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,880
Yeah.

292
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,800
With this, this is, presence of craving, presence of acquisition,

293
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,120
presence of acquisition, manifold suffering in the world,

294
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,920
manifold suffering in the world, aging in death, sorrow,

295
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,200
lamentation, pain, belief, and despair.

296
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,280
But the principle is the same.

297
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,920
When what is present, this comes to be.

298
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,280
And craving is present, acquisition comes to be.

299
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,920
But that speakable, this association comes to be,

300
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,640
both are actually in the present tense.

301
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:09,120
So literally, when craving is present, acquisition is.

302
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,320
When acquisition is present, manifold suffering

303
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,000
in the world is.

304
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,120
If it comes to be, you kind of expect

305
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,400
certain amount of time to pass it.

306
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,560
But no, presence of craving equals presence of acquisition,

307
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,440
absence of craving, absence of acquisition.

308
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,960
That's why simply by nurturing that,

309
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,840
upon which craving depends, you nurture death

310
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,520
and everything else, at the very other end of the same principle.

311
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,080
As I said, with regard, if they regard the world with a pleasant,

312
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,600
as a pleasant and renewable nature, they

313
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,400
regard this permanent happiness as self, as healthy, as a cure.

314
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,040
They nurture, they nurture, they nurture, they nurture.

315
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,360
And as you don't have to go around and regard everything

316
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,600
as horrible, despicable, all you need to do

317
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,320
is just regard the pleasure as such when it arises.

318
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,240
When there is no pleasure, no need for anything,

319
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,920
no need for any application of that medicine

320
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,640
I was talking about before.

321
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,520
Because when it's a neutral feeling,

322
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,720
all you need to do is understand it,

323
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,920
not engage in indolence, not engage in distraction.

324
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:48,040
Not trying to go into boredom, but in my sound when, oh,

325
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,440
world is pain, world is a god.

326
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,520
In a way, yes, why?

327
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,560
Because you regard world as pleasurable.

328
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,320
But you apply the notion of this is pain, this is pain,

329
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,880
this is that only to that pleasure in regard to the world.

330
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,680
And if you do so, there will be any craving in regard

331
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,800
to the world.

332
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,440
Absence of craving, there will be any acquisitions in the world.

333
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,280
No acquisitions, no suffering.

334
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:26,000
No suffering, that's it.

335
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,640
So he gives a simony.

336
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,280
Suppose because there was a bronze cup

337
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,440
of a beverage having a fine color, a Roman taste.

338
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,360
But it was mixed with poison.

339
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,440
Then a man would come along, oppressed,

340
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,160
and afflicted by the heat tied, parched, and thirsty.

341
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,120
They would tell me, good man, this beverage in the bronze cup

342
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,880
has a fine color, a Roman and taste.

343
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,560
But it is mixed with poison, drink it if you wish.

344
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,120
If you drink it, it will gratify you

345
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,000
with its color, a Roman and taste.

346
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,040
But by drinking it, you will meet with death

347
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
or deadly suffering.

348
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,560
Suddenly, without reflecting, he would drink the beverage.

349
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,720
He would not reject it.

350
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,280
And thereby, he would meet with death or deadly suffering.

351
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,560
So you can think of the same simuline example.

352
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,640
Imagine, I come to you, and I actually give you poison.

353
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,280
Then I say, it tastes nice.

354
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,640
Would you drink it?

355
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
Would you drink any of it?

356
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,720
If I tell you, it's a deadly poison, he would use it.

357
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,920
This bottle has a poison.

358
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,560
This is a poison, 100% poison.

359
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,880
He has a very nice taste of poison.

360
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,040
Would you like to drink it?

361
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,880
Only five.

362
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,080
Only five is there.

363
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,520
But only if you haven't heard me, then I say it's poison.

364
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,080
Or completely mad, basically.

365
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,560
Which is why the Buddha did say, or put you in as a mad,

366
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,200
to the effect, because they're bombarded,

367
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,120
engaging in sexuality voluntarily.

368
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
That is madness.

369
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,000
Obviously, it's, you know, this is a lovely drink.

370
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,720
Then you have to discern, it's actually a poison.

371
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,600
But imagine if somebody comes and there's

372
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,800
no lovely drink, it's straight, poison.

373
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,200
That tastes lovely, like a lovely drink.

374
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,640
But you wouldn't even consider it as a lovely drink.

375
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,880
I drinkable.

376
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
Why?

377
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Because it's a poison.

378
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Would it be worth it?

379
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
It would be valuable.

380
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,760
It would not have the significance of to be drunk,

381
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,520
because it's a poison.

382
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,840
When you see a cup with a nice drink, nice juice, cocktail,

383
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,040
whatever, oh, this is a drink.

384
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
I'm going to drink it, but this is a drinkable.

385
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,280
But if you see a bottle with a scar and bones on it,

386
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,720
that's equally probably even tastier than this drink.

387
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
You still want to regard it as drinkable,

388
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,360
because it's a poison.

389
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,560
So that's my point here.

390
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,120
That's how you actually start, need

391
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,680
to start overriding that which you regard as drinkable,

392
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,280
as consumable, as delightful, as agreeable,

393
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,040
as pleasurable, centrality, like not even as such,

394
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,280
because it's a poison.

395
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,000
Because whatever ascetics and Brahmins

396
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,640
in the past and future or present,

397
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,840
regarded that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable

398
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,720
nature as impermanence, as suffering, as non-self,

399
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,200
as a disease, as fearful, they abandoned craving.

400
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,760
In abandoning craving, they abandoned acquisition.

401
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,520
In abandoning acquisition, they abandoned suffering.

402
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,040
In abandoning, in abandoning suffering,

403
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,160
they were free from birth, aging in death.

404
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,520
They were freed from sorrow,

405
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,640
lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.

406
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,480
They were freed from suffering.

407
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,280
Again, just period as it says there in the beginning,

408
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,240
that which is pleasurable, they regarded as pain,

409
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,360
as fear, as impermanence, as disease,

410
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,000
not everything around you, because things

411
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,320
that are neutral, things that are irrelevant in terms

412
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,720
of sexuality, in terms of pleasure,

413
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,200
in terms of delight, in terms of attraction,

414
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,520
you don't have to worry about.

415
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,640
And here's another summary.

416
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,040
Suppose because there was a bronze cup of a beverage

417
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,320
having a fine color aroma and taste,

418
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,200
but it was mixed with poison.

419
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,520
Then men come along, impressed, and afflicted

420
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,640
by the heat, tied, etched, and thirsty.

421
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,840
They were telling, good man, this beverage in the bronze cup

422
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,000
has a fine color, aroma and taste,

423
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,880
but it is mixed with poison, drink it if you wish.

424
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,440
If you drink it, it will gratify you

425
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,640
with its color, aroma and taste.

426
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,200
But by drinking it, you will meet death or deadly suffering.

427
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,240
Then the man would think, I can quench my thirst with water,

428
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,240
way, porridge, or soup.

429
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,120
But I should not drink that beverage,

430
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,440
since to do so would lead to my harm and suffering

431
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,520
for a long time.

432
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,800
And that's exactly the point I just said.

433
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,840
Having reflected, he would not drink that beverage,

434
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,800
but would object it, and thereby he would not

435
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,920
meet a death.

436
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,360
Things that are not pleasurable and citing

437
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,240
the life of intoxicating, they're not a problem.

438
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,040
So he can drink water, way, things that are not desirable,

439
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,640
but serve the purpose.

440
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,880
But things that are desirable are the ones

441
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,440
where sensuality is.

442
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,000
So basically, by freeing yourself from that,

443
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,320
by seeing the danger in desire, you feel yourself from desire.

444
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,440
That doesn't mean you stop eating, you stop walking,

445
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,040
you stop dressing, you stop talking,

446
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,680
you stop doing whatever you were doing.

447
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,160
Unless, obviously, whatever you were doing

448
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,720
was an awesome based on sensuality.

449
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,200
Then you won't be doing that.

450
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,440
So that's exactly what that man realises.

451
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,240
It's that sweet tip of the pleasure that he has to say,

452
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,560
because that's where the poison is.

453
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,360
So all he has to do is drink water, bring something else,

454
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,880
that it's not sensuality, that it's not craving after,

455
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:28,840
that it's not delighted in, something that is neutral.

456
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,720
He's so mean, it doesn't give you rise.

457
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,200
To desire, you have to.

458
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,040
But you can only do that when you full understood the danger

459
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,280
of desire, when you can spend your life eating,

460
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,600
the blank food and so on, and still be bound by sensuality.

461
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,200
Because obviously, you're not seeing

462
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,040
that desire is dangerous, you're just trying to avoid it,

463
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,040
prevent it from rising.

464
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,240
But the only way to prevent it from rising, once and for all,

465
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,760
is to develop full dispassion in regards to it, in regard to it,

466
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,480
not by trying to avoid things.

467
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,560
You have to start by avoiding, either by restraining,

468
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,560
but that in itself will not lead to understanding.

469
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,080
I think I said before, it's a necessary prerequisite

470
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,240
of as a basis for developing and understanding,

471
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,240
but in itself, avoiding, I mean, still avoiding sensuality,

472
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,040
but avoiding itself will not lead to the end of sensuality,

473
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:44,280
seeing pleasure as pain, seeing sweet as poison,

474
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,800
that is what's going to free you from sensuality,

475
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
and then you can engage in neutral stuff.

476
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Like what the city is called in English.

477
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,800
In what I just said before he started reading the sutra,

478
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,800
that's what meditation is, inward exploration,

479
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,800
figured like, made understanding, practicing understanding.

480
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,800
There's no method that will tell you how to do the understanding,

481
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:21,800
figured like, made understanding, practicing understanding.
