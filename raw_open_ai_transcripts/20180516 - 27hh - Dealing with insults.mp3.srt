1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's about dealing with tinsets for annoying people, for just in general how to not be offended

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
about what others are doing or what they are saying to you, no matter what, it's kind of

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
something insulting you, how do you become bullied?

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well that is, there is another thing that there has to be rooted in the strength before

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
basically because you get offended by people by insults because your mind has no control

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
over itself, so then immediately it jumps at the worst scenario, jumps at the insult and starts

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
not wanting it, resisting it, refusing it, wanting to retaliate because of it

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but if you were able to keep your mind in check then the insult would just come and go

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and you wouldn't be affected by it, but you can't expect to be able to keep your mind

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
in check if your body hasn't been kept in check and your speech hasn't been kept in check

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so that's why, that's why it's a hard thing to do in a way because people are generally impatient

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
so they have a problem, they want to fix, but if they don't, but in order to fix it

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
you need to start building these bases for the fix, for the solution

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
because if you were a well-restraint person in regard to your own desires

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
they usually move people left and right, if you have confidence, if you have confidence

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
come from the restraint, from being able to say no to yourself, then you wouldn't lose perspective

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
even when others are basically abused you verbally or even physically

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
like you wouldn't, the mind would not feel beaten because of it

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
because it's basically the mind gives in, the mind makes itself insulted and affected by it

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
because those, the words, I mean the physical actions can stop at your body

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the words, they stop at a level of speech, but then it's the mind picks it up,

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
persists, it doesn't want it, hates it, gives into your will on account of it or similar

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:57,000
so if someone calls you an idiot, your views are ridiculous

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if you were, you're going to get offended

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you get offended if you were not clear about your own views beforehand

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
if you were holding on to them for various unwholesome reasons such as

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
a sense of identity or because you fancy yourself as an intelligent person, smart person, intellectual person

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
or just generally insecure and then you kind of find solace in conviction, faith

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and then you solve the challenges that you did struck right in your call

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but if your views have used the product of restraint and wisdom, nobody can tell it

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I mean the whole world can disagree with it, like you wouldn't be able to be affected by it

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because it's nothing wrong with it, it's not based on unwholesome, it doesn't harm anyone

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and it frees you from suffering right there right now, sorry right here and now

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
in a sense of that you have a direct verification that you're not proved and controlled by your own desires

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and as much as you used to be, which means there's already that sense of confidence

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
oh yeah, no this works, people can come and tell them no, that doesn't work

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that's ridiculous, that's just nonsense

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
it won't make a difference to you because actually you've seen it work

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
so you would only, the only conclusion would be ah, they don't know what to talk about

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
because if they were to know, they would agree with this

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
which is universally right, freedom from desire in that sense, it means freedom

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
so if you have that kind of clarity internally, then insults will won't be able to insult you

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
like if somebody says something in your will, his or her or her or your wouldn't necessarily cause your or your will

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and then you wouldn't because you're not full of your will, you wouldn't lose your own perspective

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
which means you would be able actually to hear what they're saying

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
even if it's a completely ridiculous nonsense insult

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
you would still be able to hear it because you're not immediately automatically or in a defensive

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and then sometimes you would hear, actually he has a point there

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I mean he's completely wrong because his full will will and coming from a wrong place

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but that's not my problem

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but the content of what he was saying, yeah, I should have known better, I made a mistake

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and that's it, you wouldn't be able to take it personally

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you wouldn't be able to juggle, come in, you wouldn't be able to take it personally

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and that's the problem, people cannot help but take this, well people's mind cannot help

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
but take whatever comes their way personally and then immediately end up either rejoicing in praise

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
or defending against the blame and attacking and fearing blame as well

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
even if it's completely grounded and ridiculous

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
they'll still fear just the phenomenon of blame and then then

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
it doesn't matter by whom or for if it's completely like if it's just after fabrication

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
it's not very true, it doesn't matter they'll still try to avoid blame for the sacred because they fear it

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
because they don't have that clarity and transparency and control over their own mind

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
you wouldn't be able to jump in it in that irrational manner

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
what about things like that?

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
no, no, like, it's like the weather

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
well again it's the same, similar attitude, just slightly more, slightly more subtle

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
can you pull the curtain please?

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I know again it is a form of you resisting things that are not really your goal

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to get the example of the weather, to acquire your noise

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
because you have desires that require a good weather

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and while those desires are present, the bad weather is causing that discrepancy

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that's making you know you want to get rid of it

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
but can you get rid of the bad weather?

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
can't, so that's why it's important to recognize that that discrepancy is causing you to suffer

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
if it is then you will recognize that the way that you can remove that suffering is remove the discrepancy

75
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
so if you can't change the weather, you can't change external circumstances in the nature

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
which means what you can change is change what you want at the time, change your desire

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
if you remove the desires requiring a nice sunny day

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you will be affected by it by no amount of rain or any other weather

79
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
if you had the desire to just stay in and not going anywhere

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
it doesn't matter if you are a knowledge, it's got to be a reason

81
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and that reason is that basically what makes that discrepancy

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
so you can either continue blaming the circumstances, blame the weather, blame the world, blame the other people

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
or recognize that that is inevitable and that's not where that suffering is rooted, nor that discrepancy

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
it's rooted in things that you can say no to which is your own desire

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but people take that for granted so they never want to say no to their own desire

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
which is why it's always someone else's fault whenever suffering arises

87
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
it's because of this or because of that, it's never because, oh, I crave and I cause discrepancy with my desires

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and as a result of that discrepancy I suffer

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
there is no other cause of suffering like that as if craving is sometimes suffering or something

90
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
whenever there is suffering it's because discrepancy caused by craving, nothing else

91
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and not like more or less or a bit later

92
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to the extent that there is discrepancy to that extent there is suffering

93
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and that discrepancy with craving is either trying to prolong that which doesn't last as long

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
trying to get rid of that which lasts too long

95
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
because there is certain techniques that some people might do

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
if someone's, you know, someone who's very an insultive person

97
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
who's got a lot of your wealth in you

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
right?

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
then you see them, you sort of think that they're only human

100
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
they make mistakes

101
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
no, all of those things are management of the problem

102
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
none of them, management cannot approve the problem

103
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
it can only manage it which means it requires it

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
so yes, in the beginning when there is absolutely, you don't believe that confusion

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you don't know what to do so then your management can offer some sort of help

106
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but it's a mistake to regard management as a way of practicing towards

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
abooting the problem altogether she won't arise ever again

108
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
because management just covers up, just builds the door

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
which means when the next one comes you have to manage

110
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
which means that's not freedom

111
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
when you need to do something whenever this occurs

112
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I need to go through these motions, I need to do it

113
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
sooner or later it's going to get too much

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
that's a definition of a burden, do you teach?

115
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
so you want to aim at the development of mind or meditation

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
or practice whereby you don't have to do anything on a kind of suffering

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
except see it

118
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and you cannot not see it if you're just mindful

119
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
you'll always see it because you're mindful

120
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and suffering is something that universally you cannot be oblivious to

121
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
which means all you have to do is remain mindful

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and see the suffering and then the suffering which is

123
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I mean if you're doing things rightly

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
then seeing suffering means uprooting the suffering

125
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
because you understood it

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
but management of suffering does not mean uprooting of suffering

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
so management of annoyance does not make you

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
impenetrable to future annoyance and you know that

129
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you might become very skilled manager

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and be able to deal with these things very quickly

131
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
but still you need to deal with this

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
which means you're affected in the first place

133
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and freedom of it, freedom from it is when you're not affected

134
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
even in the first place

135
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
so that's the difference when it comes to freeing yourself from suffering

136
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
don't confuse management of it as the way out of it ultimately

137
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
it's not

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the way out of it is understanding the nature of it

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
whereby having suffering or isn't means you're free from it

140
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
or simply put having suffering or isn't means it can't touch you anymore

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
a rising of suffering just reminds you that you're free of suffering

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
which means it's not your problem

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
which means it's not your suffering

144
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:10,000
there is no suffering at all
