00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
So I was wondering if you could explain Anata, what is it?

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
That's non-self, not self.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
And what's the point of it? Why do we need to know that experience?

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
It's worth it again.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Well I think you can start by explaining what it isn't.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
And it is not a denial of self, as in there is not self.

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
Because usually people would basically hear that, hear the teaching Anata,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
and then end up kind of naturally jumping into an assumption of,

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
so there is no real self, because none of this is real.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
But denying the problem doesn't actually solve it.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
And especially doesn't work in this case because the sense of self,

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
it's not about some metaphysical mistake.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
It's about the intuitive sense of ownership of your experience, of your senses.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
And because of that ownership, the sense of self is generated.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
So the sense of self in people's lives is not a problem,

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
it's a symptom of an underlying problem or ownership.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
And if you discern that right order and stop regarding things as mine,

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
and by that I mean being emotionally connected to them, because that's the ownership.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
It's not like you don't care about things that you don't care.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
So if something happens to those things, you won't be affected.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
So you saying, oh that's not mine, makes no difference.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
You want to apply the attitude of not mine onto their personal emotional level,

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
as in you want to apply it onto things that you will be affected by if you lose them.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
If they change against your will.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
So Anata is the most fundamental principle of Buddhist teaching,

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
refers exactly to that, because there's nothing that you can actually own

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
in a sense of that you would be its master, controller, in charge of.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
And I'm going to talk about your life, the most fundamental aspects of your experience.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
So your feelings, your perceptions, your intentions are fundamentally given to you basically.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
You arise, and because you're not, you don't know any better,

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
you just assume that they're mine, because they're here.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
For me, who else is there is just me.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
But that's the problem with ignorance, because there is no first origin of that mistake.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
It is a mistake, but there is no first point where that mistake became

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
before which everything was nice and pure.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
So that mistake is a starting point, which means you have to accept that there is a mistake.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
You have to accept that there is a sense of self, that thinks it owns things.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
But then you listen to the Buddhist teaching, you read the suttas,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
and you actually get the sense that it's out of the way around.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
It's because you own things, you keep redefirming that sense of self,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
as that independent owner of these things.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
But as I said, it's out of the way around.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
It's because you keep engaging in the act of ownership.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
That sense of self is being maintained.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
So you stop doing that, and then the anatomy of teaching becomes apparent.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
It's not like there is no self, there is no mistake.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
But you undo the mistake of ownership, so then you can truly say,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
there is not self, as in not my own self.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
So that phenomenon of self still remains.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Now, it's not mine.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
There is no involvement or denial of the sense of self.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
It's basically accepting it as a reason phenomenon,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
and then undoing the ownership of it.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
So you can truly say, anata means that that, which is taken to be myself,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
it's not mine.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
And that experience is the experience of anata.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
And another thing is basically, I think you spoke about it before, actually.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
I don't know whether it was recorded or not, but

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
all the people would just quote random science or things like that,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
just to prove that everything is constantly changing,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
thus nothing is mine.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
But that's not anata that the Buddha talks about.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
It's that personal side of ownership, that emotional connection to it.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
So you are not proving any anata if you say,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
look, this stone over there is comprised of such and such minerals and elements

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
and atoms and neutrons and whatever else.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Thus it's not really, it's not really real, it's not really mine.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
But you don't care about it to begin with, so you're not proving anything.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Because that sense of ownership, it's not an ideology or kind of an abstract idea,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
it's emotional attitude.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Now try explaining the same scientific way to your own daughter,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
or your son, or your child, your baby,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
or something you are inherently bound with, emotionally.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
And then see how indifferent you can remain.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
In fact of your explanation that it's nothing, it is the clump of elements and cells.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
It's pointless, it's completely, doesn't even apply on the same domain, such explanation,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
which means people use it only for this ideological purpose to justify the views.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
But practically, basically the Buddha's teaching frees you from that emotional dependence,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
doesn't explain things to you.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
So if you think that Anata is this random, everything is constantly changing and nothing is mine,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
well it isn't, because that doesn't free you from that emotional dependence upon those things.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
So you want to basically find things that you are emotionally dependent upon,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
and then start undoing the ownership of them because you see yourself liable to suffering

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
on account of losing them, even if you don't necessarily lose them.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
And actually you don't want to wait for them to be gone to see that you're liable to suffering of them being gone.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
You want to do it before.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
So that's what I mean, Anata refers to that personal attitude of something that's dear to you,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
something that you are connected with.

06:39.000 --> 06:51.000
And I think, I think the etymology of that word, of the Sanskrit Nitya, as in Nitya.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Sorry?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Anitya.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Well Anitya and Nitya, as in Anitya and it's Sanskrit.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
It's been a long time ago since I was looking for that, but there are lots of synonyms with that word

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
and it can be used basically for a personal internal dear to me, Nitya.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And then basically Anitya would be the opposite of that.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
So yes, you can say it's impermanent, but actually it probably doesn't do it justice

07:17.000 --> 07:21.380
because of, well today's modern contemporary view is what people think

07:21.380 --> 07:27.380
of impermanence, impermanence is this kind of almost impersonal debate of physics,

07:27.380 --> 07:29.380
of how everything is impermanent, everything is constantly changing.

07:29.380 --> 07:34.380
But there's just denial of the existence of the things that you are emotionally bound with.

07:34.380 --> 07:40.380
And that denial can provide people with a relief, with a degree of relief,

07:40.380 --> 07:44.380
which is why they mistake it for some sort of truth, because you deny the problem,

07:44.380 --> 07:49.380
it covers the problem up, but it doesn't solve it, doesn't approach it,

07:49.380 --> 07:54.380
which means sooner or later, well you'll forget about denying it, or something else will point at it,

07:54.380 --> 07:59.380
remind you of it, and you're back the square one, you made no difference.

07:59.380 --> 08:04.380
So that's why you really want to first accept the problem and stop denying it,

08:04.380 --> 08:07.380
and stop finding justification for it.

08:07.380 --> 08:14.380
And that can be helped if you think that Nitya and Anitya actually refers to personal and dear,

08:14.380 --> 08:22.380
and then not taken personally and not dear to me, as in you're indifferent, emotional equilibrium.

08:22.380 --> 08:25.380
And there's that similarity that the Buddha gives to the monks.

08:25.380 --> 08:30.380
He said, monks people get basically upset, affected by suffering,

08:30.380 --> 08:36.380
when things that they are attached to are gone, are affected.

08:36.380 --> 08:39.380
So they should basically abandon the attachment.

08:39.380 --> 08:45.380
He doesn't say they should basically find the justification for the denial of the existence of those things.

08:45.380 --> 08:52.380
And then the simile that he gives is basically when he says they were sitting in the in the in the forest,

08:52.380 --> 08:57.380
and he said, so for example, see all these sticks and branches just lying around here,

08:57.380 --> 08:59.380
that you are completely indifferent to.

08:59.380 --> 09:05.380
Would you be upset if some people come here and start breaking these branches and taking them and burning them?

09:05.380 --> 09:10.380
Of course we wouldn't, why? Because we are completely emotionally indifferent.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.380
These branches are nothing to me.

09:12.380 --> 09:17.380
He says, well, that's how you should then cultivate the same attitude towards your own body,

09:17.380 --> 09:19.380
towards your own senses, towards your own life.

09:19.380 --> 09:23.380
But he didn't say, that's how you should start dismissing your own body and saying,

09:23.380 --> 09:25.380
well, it's not really real and whatever else.

09:25.380 --> 09:28.380
Because they would just be obscuring the problem.

09:28.380 --> 09:36.380
So yes, you won the attitude of completely indifferent,

09:36.380 --> 09:43.380
economists in regard to your own existence, your own senses, your own thoughts, basically your own feelings.

09:43.380 --> 09:48.380
But that cannot be done if you keep denying those thoughts and feelings or explaining them

09:48.380 --> 09:53.380
in some sort of ideological terms such as like a scientific take.

09:53.380 --> 09:58.380
Because often people would say, oh yes, the modern science is proving that the Buddha was right.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.380
If the modern science were proving that the Buddha was right,

10:01.380 --> 10:05.380
it means that every modern scientist who takes it at view would be at least a sort of animal.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.380
Or even more.

10:07.380 --> 10:10.380
But the fact that they are not means they don't know what the term is,

10:10.380 --> 10:13.380
so they cannot even accidentally prove it.

10:13.380 --> 10:19.380
And furthermore, science is directly divorced from any phenomenological proof of the Buddha's teaching

10:19.380 --> 10:24.380
because science inherently negates the existence of observer,

10:24.380 --> 10:27.380
of the subject, of the personal point of view.

10:27.380 --> 10:32.380
Science inherently operates under the assumption of a public world independent of all of us,

10:32.380 --> 10:37.380
failing to see that that's the point of view that you are completely bound up with

10:37.380 --> 10:39.380
and you cannot step outside of it.

10:39.380 --> 10:45.380
Which means if you engage in science on account of trying to understand the Buddha's teaching,

10:45.380 --> 10:50.380
or if you engage in a scientific view basically, you're engaging in the view of the denial of the problem

10:50.380 --> 10:56.380
of the personality, personal attachment, craving in regard to your feelings and all of that.

10:56.380 --> 10:59.380
Because then you're just explaining what's happening.

10:59.380 --> 11:02.380
You're not really uprooting it through understanding.

11:02.380 --> 11:05.380
Which is already what Sotopana begins to do.

11:05.380 --> 11:14.380
So similar actually to that.

11:14.380 --> 11:18.380
I got a book I wanted to read that bit.

11:18.380 --> 11:21.380
It's quite connected to that whole denial.

11:21.380 --> 11:26.380
It's when people, like the other similes in the suttas where people would say,

11:26.380 --> 11:35.380
well this body is made out of various organs and parts that, you know, when they break down,

11:35.380 --> 11:38.380
there won't be any life left, there won't be any body remaining.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.380
Thus there is nothing for me to take there to be mine.

11:42.380 --> 11:47.380
But people, again, it's easy to misread that because the point is subtle.

11:47.380 --> 11:52.380
So people would then think, ah, things that are made out of parts are not real.

11:52.380 --> 11:56.380
So there's the famous, the questions of the King Melinda when he says, well,

11:56.380 --> 12:01.380
it's like having a chariot that is made out of parts.

12:01.380 --> 12:05.380
And if you take the chariot apart, you have all these random parts.

12:05.380 --> 12:08.380
Thus, chariot doesn't really exist.

12:08.380 --> 12:17.380
But that argument fails to see that a chariot is already a particular functional assembly of parts.

12:17.380 --> 12:21.380
And if you don't call it chariot, you can call it an assembly of parts.

12:21.380 --> 12:24.380
And that's a completely valid reality and valid truth.

12:24.380 --> 12:26.380
And it was never the problem.

12:26.380 --> 12:29.380
But because the problem is subtle, the problem is not in the things that you own.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.380
It's not in the conventions or your designations.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.380
The problem is in your attitude towards it.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.380
As in attitude of appropriation and assumption.

12:38.380 --> 12:41.380
That's what we said, the five aggregates are not Upadana.

12:41.380 --> 12:47.380
Five aggregates are not assumption and attachment, but there is no attachment without the five aggregates.

12:47.380 --> 12:51.380
But these questions of King Melinda, he actually goes in explaining that see,

12:51.380 --> 12:54.380
five aggregates can actually be broken into parts.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.380
There is no real person there.

12:56.380 --> 13:01.380
But that is putting the problem of ownership, putting the problem of attachment into the five aggregates

13:01.380 --> 13:04.380
and then destroying the five aggregates, you destroy the problem.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.380
But the Buddha himself said the problem is not in it.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.380
It's in regard to it.

13:08.380 --> 13:15.380
Desire you lost in regard to the five aggregates, the attachment to your experience is there.

13:15.380 --> 13:19.380
So that's what I mean like using that kind of argument just obscures the problem.

13:19.380 --> 13:20.380
Doesn't solve it.

13:20.380 --> 13:24.380
Denial of the reality doesn't solve your attachment to it.

13:24.380 --> 13:28.380
Because then you become attached to the reality of that denial.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.380
And you just obscure it.

13:30.380 --> 13:35.380
When you read in the suttas, when the Buddha would encourage people to investigate, well not investigate,

13:35.380 --> 13:43.380
but really contemplate the various parts of your body as in a basis for experiencing a non-attraction and revulsion.

13:43.380 --> 13:49.380
That's basically to undermine your gratuitous notion of Bodhi's beautiful.

13:49.380 --> 13:56.380
Or to undermine your gratuitous notion of you are in control, like you are the master of this body.

13:56.380 --> 14:03.380
So in order to practice that contemplation rightly, you need to do it on the basis of that body that has arisen

14:03.380 --> 14:09.380
on the basis of that ownership of your body, which means you need to start seeing these parts of the body

14:09.380 --> 14:14.380
within that single unit of the functional arrangement that your body is.

14:14.380 --> 14:20.380
Because by seeing that there are parts of this functional arrangement of the unit of the body that I own,

14:20.380 --> 14:23.380
you can see that actually that ownership is gratuitous.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.380
It's not that that body is not real.

14:26.380 --> 14:32.380
The ownership is gratuitous because this thing that I own, that I think I'm the full master controller,

14:32.380 --> 14:39.380
is fully determined by these random things that I can't even access. For example, your beating heart.

14:39.380 --> 14:46.380
Like I see even the expression, my beating heart, you kind of assume the ownership because it belongs to this body that you own.

14:46.380 --> 14:53.380
Now you trying to say, oh well see this heart is on its own, operates on its own, if it stops, my life is gone, that's all true.

14:53.380 --> 15:01.380
But if you use that argument to say that thus there is really no body there, it's just these parts, well they're just obscuring the issue.

15:01.380 --> 15:08.380
Because there is the body there, because otherwise if there is nothing there, how can you even direct your denial at it?

15:08.380 --> 15:17.380
It has to be there to some extent. And that extent is the functional arrangement of the body that is actually comprised out of individual independent parts,

15:17.380 --> 15:22.380
not me and my sense of self and my sense of mastery and my control.

15:22.380 --> 15:28.380
So yes, it's mentioned in the suit as often this kind of reflection of various bodily parts,

15:28.380 --> 15:38.380
but it needs to be done correctly, needs to be done on the basis of the body, so that then you can remove that which is not necessary in regard to that experience,

15:38.380 --> 15:47.380
and that is your own ownership of it. Your gratuitous assumption of mastery of your life, like fundamentally, even like biological, my own heart.

15:47.380 --> 15:51.380
But if it were yours, you would be able to tell it when to beat and how to beat.

15:51.380 --> 15:59.380
You wouldn't be completely left out, pushed outside of it. You can't even access the notion of voluntarily controlling your heart.

15:59.380 --> 16:05.380
Yet if that random pumping muscle in your chest stops, your life's gone. That is.

16:05.380 --> 16:11.380
Yet at the same time you maintain the full notion of mastery over your life.

16:11.380 --> 16:21.380
So looking at the heart is just, if done correctly, it will approve that gratuitous mastery. It will not deny the reality of your life.

16:21.380 --> 16:26.380
And that's why Arahant, who is fully approved to that, and a light and person is fully approved,

16:26.380 --> 16:30.380
he still operates normally, seemingly from external point of view.

16:30.380 --> 16:35.380
He has intentions, he has choices, he has decisions. All that stays.

16:35.380 --> 16:42.380
What he doesn't have is the ownership of the five-aggregate. He doesn't have the ownership of the experience as a whole.

16:42.380 --> 16:46.380
He doesn't own his body, he doesn't own his intentions. It doesn't mean he's...

16:46.380 --> 16:50.380
And the only way to arrive, basically, and that point of not ownership is to first accept it.

16:50.380 --> 16:59.380
Hence the accepting of responsibility for your own actions, accepting the validity, basically, of actions, of the results of actions,

16:59.380 --> 17:04.380
of the results of practice needs to be the first step. That's the mundane right view.

17:04.380 --> 17:09.380
But if you keep denying it, as it's not real, you are denying the basis for your practice.

17:19.380 --> 17:23.380
It's very easy to deny the problem. There's no self.

17:23.380 --> 17:31.380
That for me is the most natural reaction, which is bound to the most fundamental attitude that the Buddha will describe it.

17:31.380 --> 17:36.380
When there is a pleasure, affirm it further, that's how people react.

17:36.380 --> 17:41.380
When people experience the unpleasant attitude denied, try to get rid of it, remove it.

17:41.380 --> 17:48.380
And that's like craving in regard to pleasant, craving in regard to unpleasant.

17:48.380 --> 17:54.380
So in this particular instance, you realize that there is a problem.

17:54.380 --> 18:03.380
There is a problem of the gratuitous sense of self that thinks it's a master and owner, yet the experience keeps contradicting it.

18:03.380 --> 18:13.380
Because the suffering, the discrepancy of experiencing suffering, should be enough for an authentic, transparent person to see that actually you are not in control.

18:13.380 --> 18:18.380
And your gratuitous notion of control, it's the reason for your suffering.

18:18.380 --> 18:23.380
You are the one responsible for the discrepancy of your resistance to them results in suffering.

18:23.380 --> 18:28.380
All results in being liable to suffer.

18:28.380 --> 18:31.380
It results in possibility to suffer.

18:31.380 --> 18:33.380
Possibility to be affected by suffering.

18:33.380 --> 18:37.380
And that in itself, recognition of that is what suffering is.

18:43.380 --> 18:46.380
What about seeing yourself directly?

18:46.380 --> 18:47.380
Sorry?

18:47.380 --> 18:49.380
Seeing yourself directly.

18:49.380 --> 18:54.380
Seeing your sense of self directly when you come, because you'll be seeing it with your sense of self.

18:54.380 --> 18:59.380
As in you'll be appropriating that in the gratuitous sense of mastery over the sense of self.

18:59.380 --> 19:04.380
Which means the sense of self, that's what I said, it's a symptom.

19:04.380 --> 19:07.380
It's not an issue that you can see and then directly address.

19:07.380 --> 19:12.380
It's a symptom caused by, so you have to start looking at it as such.

19:12.380 --> 19:18.380
Because if you blame the symptom for the illness, you're not going to see the illness.

19:18.380 --> 19:20.380
That undermines it.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.380
That underlies it, sorry.

19:22.380 --> 19:28.380
So you have to recognize that you can't access that sense of self directly because it's done with the notion of self.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.380
Which means your sense of self.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.380
You might think, oh, this is myself.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.380
And that means that you're that gratuitous sense of ownership in regard to that experience.

19:36.380 --> 19:37.380
Is it the background of it?

19:37.380 --> 19:39.380
It's always elsewhere from where you look.

19:39.380 --> 19:44.380
So you have to stop trying to expect you're going to find it through like looking and spotting where it is.

19:44.380 --> 19:48.380
Because you don't need to.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.380
Once you recognize it's a symptom, okay.

19:50.380 --> 19:53.380
So you stop trying to chase the symptom.

19:53.380 --> 19:57.380
You use it as a criteria whether the illness is still present.

19:57.380 --> 20:02.380
And that illness is the sense of ownership of things that you do have say.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.380
That you can kind of experience and relate to directly.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.380
Such as I choose centrality.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.380
I choose ill will.

20:09.380 --> 20:13.380
I choose this or with this because I'm purely acting out of desire for pleasure.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.380
Desire and lust in regard to the five aggregates.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.380
That's what I would describe.

20:17.380 --> 20:20.380
That's why the Upadana and the ultimate Upadana.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.380
The ultimate attachment is the attachment of the self view.

20:23.380 --> 20:27.380
That's just the key picking lady.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.380
Stop barking.

20:29.380 --> 20:34.380
The ultimate Upadana is the Upadana of the self view.

20:34.380 --> 20:37.380
And so you maintain basically that symptom.

20:37.380 --> 20:41.380
Because you keep engaging in that which is keeping you sick.

20:41.380 --> 20:45.380
You keep maintaining your desire and lust in regard to your experience.

20:45.380 --> 20:49.380
And that's something that you knowingly do.

20:49.380 --> 20:53.380
So that's the problem with people who kind of are familiar with the Buddhist practice.

20:53.380 --> 20:55.380
They're aware of the sense of self.

20:55.380 --> 20:59.380
They're aware that it's supposed to be seen as not myself as in anata.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.380
But they don't see necessarily the connection.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.380
So then they just keep trying to deny the sense of self.

21:03.380 --> 21:06.380
Trying to like go not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine.

21:06.380 --> 21:09.380
And address it on its own terms.

21:09.380 --> 21:12.380
Bailing to see basically that it's their desire and lust.

21:12.380 --> 21:15.380
They're fully aware in regard to other things throughout their life.

21:15.380 --> 21:19.380
That's the connection that they're missing.

21:19.380 --> 21:23.380
And that's why because of that the whole sense of the sensory strength

21:23.380 --> 21:26.380
and sea lion virtue comes first.

21:26.380 --> 21:32.380
Because you can't possibly not be perpetuating desire and lust in your thoughts.

21:32.380 --> 21:36.380
When your physical actions and verbal actions are fully engaged in it.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.380
You can think your thoughts are pure as much as you want, but they're not.

21:39.380 --> 21:44.380
Because your behavior is still perpetuating that mistake in pattern.

21:46.380 --> 21:54.380
So you have to start training it on that level so that then it can become clearly visible on the level of your thought.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.380
So that's what I mean.

22:01.380 --> 22:04.380
You have to see the connection between these things

22:04.380 --> 22:08.380
as in your security sense of ownership is maintained

22:08.380 --> 22:13.380
through your careless giving into the desire, giving into the ill will,

22:13.380 --> 22:18.380
giving into the distraction, giving into the unfals, some states, in your daily experience.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.380
And that's where the practice is.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.380
Being watchful of those things.

22:22.380 --> 22:25.380
Not being watchful of everything and nothing or trying to catch your sense of self

22:25.380 --> 22:28.380
or trying to catch a perfect moment that will reveal that nothing is real,

22:28.380 --> 22:30.380
that there is no self really.

22:30.380 --> 22:34.380
No, none of that was ever a problem.

22:34.380 --> 22:37.380
The only problem is you engaging in unwholesome.

22:37.380 --> 22:40.380
And that's why it's defined as unwholesome.

22:40.380 --> 22:46.380
Because it keeps, it's a direct determination of the problem of suffering,

22:46.380 --> 22:51.380
of the problem of gratuitous ownership and mastery of your experience.

22:51.380 --> 22:53.380
That's why it's unwholesome.

22:53.380 --> 22:55.380
If it doesn't partake in that, it's not unwholesome.

22:55.380 --> 23:00.380
Which means it's either neutral or it's either wholesome.

23:05.380 --> 23:06.380
Hey.

23:06.380 --> 23:08.380
Shut it.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.380
Shut it.

23:10.380 --> 23:12.380
Go and play the job.

23:12.380 --> 23:29.380
He's healthy.

23:29.380 --> 23:36.380
So what happens when you no longer own that sense of self?

23:36.380 --> 23:39.380
Well, that's true definition of freedom.

23:39.380 --> 23:43.380
You have basically laid down the burden.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.380
The burden of action, the burden of...

23:46.380 --> 23:49.380
You have laid down the liability to suffer.

23:49.380 --> 23:52.380
He just cannot affect you.

23:52.380 --> 23:54.380
And that's the direct measure of that freedom.

23:54.380 --> 23:59.380
Inability to suffer, I mean suffering.

23:59.380 --> 24:02.380
That sounds like a kind of madness.

24:02.380 --> 24:05.380
Like somebody who denies...

24:05.380 --> 24:06.380
Well, no.

24:06.380 --> 24:07.380
See, that's what I mean.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.380
That's what I keep saying.

24:09.380 --> 24:12.380
You have to start with non-denial because it will result exactly in that.

24:12.380 --> 24:15.380
People doing all sorts of horrendous things and then saying,

24:15.380 --> 24:17.380
well, there is really nobody there.

24:17.380 --> 24:20.380
Which was exactly one of the wrong views that the Buddha was criticizing.

24:20.380 --> 24:23.380
Back in the day when, in India, they believed.

24:23.380 --> 24:27.380
And actually, I read that there was in Bhagavad Gita was the whole point of saying,

24:27.380 --> 24:28.380
nobody, you can go and kill.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.380
You can chop people's heads off.

24:30.380 --> 24:31.380
And nobody gets healed.

24:31.380 --> 24:35.380
Killed is just a sword running through the elements and whatnot.

24:35.380 --> 24:38.380
The Buddha criticizes that as extremely wrong view.

24:38.380 --> 24:41.380
They can result in a lot of suffering for you if you act out of it.

24:41.380 --> 24:44.380
See, that's when you basically jump to a conclusion,

24:44.380 --> 24:48.380
not develop the understanding of the conclusion.

24:48.380 --> 24:51.380
And if you actually look closer to this conclusion, you realize,

24:51.380 --> 24:54.380
okay, in order to understand it, I must stop denying things.

24:54.380 --> 24:57.380
I must accept that human life is a real thing.

24:57.380 --> 24:58.380
A choice is a real thing.

24:58.380 --> 25:01.380
The body, it's a reality as such.

25:01.380 --> 25:04.380
Things appear differently, but they are real.

25:04.380 --> 25:06.380
In whatever manner they appear.

25:06.380 --> 25:11.380
So even a pure abstract thought, it is real as an abstract thought.

25:11.380 --> 25:14.380
That's a definition of phenomenology.

25:14.380 --> 25:18.380
As in basic understanding of phenomena, the standing of appearance.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.380
But people get a hint of it, maybe.

25:20.380 --> 25:21.380
Ah, there is really no self.

25:21.380 --> 25:24.380
They find their view pleasing without any understanding of it.

25:24.380 --> 25:26.380
And that's when they develop these conclusions.

25:26.380 --> 25:30.380
Ah, so I can do whatever I want because there is no doer there.

25:30.380 --> 25:32.380
And there is nobody who receives that doing either.

25:32.380 --> 25:34.380
And nobody affected.

25:34.380 --> 25:38.380
And that was exactly the view in the time of the Buddha.

25:38.380 --> 25:42.380
And before, and obviously after, whereby you can say things such as,

25:42.380 --> 25:45.380
no, no, no, it should you to go and kill these people.

25:45.380 --> 25:46.380
You can go and kill them.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.380
And nobody gets killed anyway.

25:48.380 --> 25:53.380
We are all already divine and saved and whatnot.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.380
So that's what I mean.

25:54.380 --> 26:01.380
The denial must stop first in order for basis of understanding to arise.

26:01.380 --> 26:06.380
Because how can you understand the ownership of something that you appropriate as yours

26:06.380 --> 26:09.380
if you keep denying that you appropriated anything?

26:11.380 --> 26:14.380
Oh, why are you going to give me back, I don't know.

26:14.380 --> 26:15.380
Those books, I'll end you.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.380
What books?

26:16.380 --> 26:17.380
There are no books.

26:17.380 --> 26:18.380
Books don't exist.

26:18.380 --> 26:20.380
What are you talking about?

26:20.380 --> 26:22.380
No, you took it.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.380
And in this case, it's even worse because you keep thinking it.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.380
That which is not yours.

26:26.380 --> 26:32.380
You keep regarding it as mine.

26:32.380 --> 26:35.380
So who's the real owner?

26:35.380 --> 26:40.380
Well, the real, the question of a real owner is based on the already that

26:40.380 --> 26:42.380
misperceived owner that you are.

26:42.380 --> 26:45.380
As in, okay, so if I'm not the owner, who's the real owner?

26:45.380 --> 26:48.380
And that's exactly, again, another view back in India,

26:48.380 --> 26:51.380
that's very prevalent today, the greatest sense of self.

26:51.380 --> 26:55.380
You abandon your sense of self by surrendering it to the greatest sense of self.

26:55.380 --> 26:59.380
But the slightest notion of the sense of self, you can only relate to it

26:59.380 --> 27:02.380
because you're maintaining it on your own self level.

27:02.380 --> 27:07.380
As in, if you abandon your sense of self, truly, if you see this thoroughly

27:07.380 --> 27:11.380
unhonable, so to speak, thoroughly independent of you because it depends upon

27:11.380 --> 27:15.380
things that you cannot even access, let alone control and tell him what to do.

27:15.380 --> 27:20.380
Notion, any extension of that sense of self is seen under the same nature.

27:20.380 --> 27:22.380
Not mine, not for me, not myself.

27:22.380 --> 27:27.380
So if people can conceive and conceive and act out of the greater sense of self

27:27.380 --> 27:32.380
as in God, for example, they do so based on the very personal sense of self.

27:32.380 --> 27:37.380
And that's why Sartre meant in the, basically, the most common idea of God

27:37.380 --> 27:38.380
is just the extension.

27:38.380 --> 27:44.380
It basically is the ideal of your sense of self, being the ultimate master creator.

27:44.380 --> 27:48.380
Then you project into this outer universe of the great, the great God,

27:48.380 --> 27:52.380
being of God, or whatever, the mystic energy and so on.

27:52.380 --> 27:56.380
All of that is relatable only through your sense of self.

27:56.380 --> 27:58.380
And that's another thing.

27:58.380 --> 28:02.380
You can either deny your sense of self, try to get rid of it, which fails,

28:02.380 --> 28:06.380
or you can try to envelope it in a greater sense of self, which is just, again,

28:06.380 --> 28:11.380
just extension proliferation of it, which is even worse because it's another way

28:11.380 --> 28:13.380
for executing your own sense of self.

28:13.380 --> 28:19.380
Same would be always, it was God's will and so on.

28:19.380 --> 28:26.380
You decided, you decided that what you've done was actually rooted in the greater sense of self

28:26.380 --> 28:30.380
because, yeah, truly, intentions arise on their own.

28:30.380 --> 28:33.380
But you are the one who chooses to act upon them.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.380
Intentions present themselves.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.380
You see a cup, you can use it for drinking, you can use it for throwing,

28:39.380 --> 28:43.380
chasing, chasing, chasing, chasing, I don't know, chasing a wild animal.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.380
You can use it for all these sorts of things.

28:45.380 --> 28:49.380
It's an object that has all this intentionality implied in it.

28:49.380 --> 28:55.380
But you choose to use it in a certain manner, on account of whatever you're trying to achieve.

28:55.380 --> 28:59.380
But then dismissing the, basically dismissing the reality of the cup

28:59.380 --> 29:06.380
or the object you chose to use, you hope to cover up your responsibility for the choice of that thing.

29:06.380 --> 29:09.380
And that's something you can't do.

29:09.380 --> 29:14.380
Or ascribing the intentionality of an object to a greater God

29:14.380 --> 29:19.380
and then saying, well, see, these things were presented to me in all these manner, that's why I used it.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.380
It's not my fault.

29:21.380 --> 29:25.380
Yeah, it's not your fault that things were presented in a manner of options.

29:25.380 --> 29:31.380
But it is your fault to choose to act upon it irresponsibly and deny the responsibility or act out of greedy version delusion.

29:31.380 --> 29:34.380
That's what I mean, denial must stop.

29:34.380 --> 29:39.380
Because as long as you deny things, you interfere with that, which is actually not on you.

29:39.380 --> 29:43.380
Arising of the thoughts, arising of the options, arising of the intentions.

29:43.380 --> 29:48.380
But you then choosing to act in a certain manner, on account of this or on account of that, that's on you.

29:48.380 --> 29:54.380
And that's why the Buddha would say all he teaches, basically, is suffering in freedom from it

29:54.380 --> 29:58.380
in a sense of by avoiding unwholesome, cultivate the wholesome.

29:58.380 --> 30:06.380
Because it's not unwholesome to have a thought of throwing the subject at somebody.

30:06.380 --> 30:14.380
But if you then start relishing that thought and thinking upon it further intentionally, now that bit is unwholesome and that's on you.

30:14.380 --> 30:21.380
Or even worse, if you choose then to verbally start acting upon it in an abusive manner and then physically start abusing somebody,

30:21.380 --> 30:27.380
well, that's of course, that's just the further proliferation of that unwholesome attitude.

30:27.380 --> 30:31.380
So that's what I mean, the responsibility must be taken first.

30:31.380 --> 30:36.380
The denial of things must be basically abandoned.

30:36.380 --> 30:39.380
And then you created the basis for the practice of Dhamma.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.380
And that's why it's a middle way.

30:41.380 --> 30:44.380
Because you don't go and deny everything or affirm everything.

30:44.380 --> 30:49.380
You recognize where the line is, where your responsibility begins and where it ends.

30:49.380 --> 30:54.380
And you start thinking like that, you can make sense out of what Arran is.

30:54.380 --> 31:01.380
Because people would often like, what, Arran is this like thoughtless, basically robot who just acts automatically.

31:01.380 --> 31:09.380
No, he's just a person who has basically removed any ownership, any appropriation, any interference of things that arise naturally,

31:09.380 --> 31:13.380
which means he's incapable of acting unwholesome.

31:13.380 --> 31:17.380
It doesn't mean that whatever he does or says will be pleasing to people.

31:17.380 --> 31:24.380
It means that he cannot be rooted in greater version delusion, cannot be rooted in the wrong view.

31:36.380 --> 31:38.380
Come here boy.

31:40.380 --> 31:41.380
Come here.

31:41.380 --> 31:43.380
Come here boy.

31:43.380 --> 31:44.380
Hey.

31:44.380 --> 31:47.380
You have trouble?

31:47.380 --> 31:52.380
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Focus. Sit.

31:52.380 --> 31:54.380
Good boy. Come here.

31:54.380 --> 31:57.380
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.380
You have trouble.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.380
But you're a good girl.

32:01.380 --> 32:04.380
I don't want him to go down there. That fence is fixed.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.380
You might discover.

32:06.380 --> 32:15.380
Boy, you wouldn't.

32:36.380 --> 32:51.380
That's when practical terms and ultimately, all a person would need to do really is keep an eye on their own intentions,

32:51.380 --> 33:04.380
motivations, what makes them act, because that's what determines wholesome and wholesome and then how wholesome or how and wholesome can be.

33:04.380 --> 33:08.380
And that's something you cannot not be aware of.

33:08.380 --> 33:13.380
And mindfulness is something you can't have too much of as the Buddha described.

33:13.380 --> 33:17.380
It's also like a rigid, mechanical observation of moment to moment to moment.

33:17.380 --> 33:21.380
No, it's awareness of that which is already present.

33:21.380 --> 33:25.380
Fundamentally, intentions.

33:25.380 --> 33:32.380
Because if you're mindful basically of your body being, you're mindful of your situation that's already intentional.

33:32.380 --> 33:36.380
If you're mindful of your feelings, you're mindful of the situation that's already intentional.

33:36.380 --> 33:42.380
Which means you're then mindful, not necessarily to the full extent.

33:42.380 --> 33:47.380
That's what Buddha said, mindfulness developed to the extent necessary for the final knowledge.

33:47.380 --> 33:53.380
But the possibility of you being mindful of it is always there because these things are present.

33:53.380 --> 34:01.380
So that means you can actually then discern the background of whatever your situation is, which is already that background is part of it.

34:01.380 --> 34:05.380
You can then discern the subtler motivation behind your actions.

34:05.380 --> 34:09.380
And if you discern it, you will see if it's wholesome or unwholesome.

34:09.380 --> 34:14.380
Is this rooted in desire, sensuality, greed, aversion?

34:14.380 --> 34:18.380
Is this rooted really in your will, desire to harm or something?

34:18.380 --> 34:24.380
What is generally rooted in good, in non-greed, non-aversion?

34:24.380 --> 34:29.380
And if once you discern it, you'll be able to then not act afterwards.

34:29.380 --> 34:35.380
What do you need to do? You don't need to try to get rid of the possibilities of unwholesome.

34:35.380 --> 34:38.380
They're just part of how things arise.

34:38.380 --> 34:41.380
You can use it for good or for bad.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.380
Responsibilities on your choice are hard to use it.

34:44.380 --> 34:49.380
Not on the possibility of how it can be used.

34:49.380 --> 34:56.380
But none of that can become apparent if you're just sort of completely, if you're completely obscured,

34:56.380 --> 34:59.380
that responsibility of your own choice, that wholesome, that unwholesome.

34:59.380 --> 35:02.380
And you've secured it through denying or through projecting it onto someone else.

35:02.380 --> 35:07.380
Someone else's fault, it's the God's will and everything else.

35:07.380 --> 35:15.380
Say, even if it's God's will to present you with a certain choice, he can't make you choose this A over B.

35:15.380 --> 35:21.380
That's why the early existential philosophy said, it's not that the phenomenology and phenomenological method,

35:21.380 --> 35:24.380
it's atheistic or anything like that.

35:24.380 --> 35:28.380
It's basically just recognizing the fact that God has no power over your choice.

35:28.380 --> 35:32.380
So you can allow the gods to exist as much as you want.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.380
But none of the gods can tell you how to choose it.

35:35.380 --> 35:39.380
You are the one who chooses what God told you to act upon it.

35:39.380 --> 35:43.380
Which means, whether things come your way out of complete circumstance,

35:43.380 --> 35:50.380
or randomness, accident, gods will, previews action, previews karma and the path and whatever else,

35:50.380 --> 35:54.380
makes no difference because you presently are responsible for choosing how to act upon it.

35:54.380 --> 35:59.380
Oh, this is because of, no, a lot of, sorry.

35:59.380 --> 36:01.380
I've done this because of that.

36:01.380 --> 36:05.380
No, because you've done that because you chose this to be the reason for it.

36:10.380 --> 36:13.380
Because you can always say no to everything, or yes to everything.

36:13.380 --> 36:20.380
Which means, you can always do the opposite of whatever is presented to you.

36:20.380 --> 36:22.380
Means the choice is always a new.

36:22.380 --> 36:29.380
That's why the whole definition in the philosophy was basically, man is condemned to be free.

36:29.380 --> 36:32.380
But you cannot not choose.

36:32.380 --> 36:35.380
Sometimes people think if I abstained from choice, I didn't choose.

36:35.380 --> 36:38.380
But abstaining from choice, it's another choice.

36:38.380 --> 36:40.380
You just chose that.

36:40.380 --> 36:44.380
That's why the Buddha said, the being means exactly this basically.

36:44.380 --> 36:46.380
Beings are bound with their actions.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.380
They cannot escape them.

36:48.380 --> 36:53.380
As in abstaining from your action becomes an action for you.

36:53.380 --> 36:58.380
So the only way to escape the action is to truly first accept it,

36:58.380 --> 37:03.380
and then see the degree of your responsibility in it and stop maintaining a fact.

37:03.380 --> 37:11.380
You're trying to overly deny action or overly explain it.

37:11.380 --> 37:12.380
Sorry.

37:16.380 --> 37:22.380
So in practical terms, people want to meditate and practice correctly.

37:22.380 --> 37:29.380
In this manner, always keep a corner of your eye at the back of your mind,

37:29.380 --> 37:32.380
basically where your intentions are.

37:32.380 --> 37:35.380
Now you do something, checking yourself, why are you doing it?

37:35.380 --> 37:36.380
Why do you want to do it?

37:36.380 --> 37:38.380
You always get an answer.

37:38.380 --> 37:44.380
It might take a time to cut through all that, like layers of cover-ups, but it's there.

37:44.380 --> 37:45.380
You know the truth.

37:45.380 --> 37:47.380
You know the truth.

37:47.380 --> 37:51.380
As we were discussing before, similarly I was telling you,

37:51.380 --> 37:54.380
for the example, it was really simply good.

37:54.380 --> 38:00.380
Say you're somebody who is on a...

38:00.380 --> 38:03.380
That's a beautiful ego.

38:03.380 --> 38:08.380
You're somebody who is on a not necessarily a strict meditation retreat,

38:08.380 --> 38:13.380
but say you're practicing seclusion, practicing non-distraction and so on.

38:13.380 --> 38:21.380
And then you have a thought that arises, I want to go to the library in the monastery.

38:21.380 --> 38:25.380
And now to get some sort of books so I can read and study harder.

38:25.380 --> 38:29.380
Now I see on the external, based on the external point of view,

38:29.380 --> 38:31.380
that's a good thing to do.

38:31.380 --> 38:36.380
Reading suit does, enriching the basis of your knowledge, contemplation and so on.

38:36.380 --> 38:39.380
But that's not the point of view that matters.

38:39.380 --> 38:42.380
It's the internal point of view that matters for whoever practices it.

38:42.380 --> 38:47.380
So where you usually want to do notes, like try to justify your impending action

38:47.380 --> 38:50.380
based on the external acceptance of it or denial of it,

38:50.380 --> 38:54.380
you want to justify it or not based on the internal reasoning.

38:54.380 --> 38:58.380
So if you start looking at it, why do I really want to go to the library

38:58.380 --> 39:00.380
and take these books right now?

39:00.380 --> 39:05.380
Wait for a while because probably you're not going to get the answer immediately.

39:05.380 --> 39:09.380
But you can then see that, oh actually I want to go because I hope there will be some people there

39:09.380 --> 39:11.380
and I'll end up being distracted.

39:11.380 --> 39:15.380
I'll end up talking to somebody because I feel a bit, well,

39:15.380 --> 39:17.380
pressure of doing nothing being alone.

39:17.380 --> 39:21.380
So going into the group of people can alleviate that pressure.

39:21.380 --> 39:24.380
But I can't admit that to myself directly.

39:24.380 --> 39:28.380
So I go, I find an excuse of going to a library to take the suitors.

39:28.380 --> 39:31.380
Where I know there is a 90% chance they will be like-minded people

39:31.380 --> 39:33.380
and they're going to start talking to me.

39:33.380 --> 39:35.380
But that's the whole point.

39:35.380 --> 39:38.380
Then I won't feel responsible for choosing to distract myself

39:38.380 --> 39:40.380
because of what they started talking to me.

39:40.380 --> 39:43.380
It would have been rude to just remain silent.

39:43.380 --> 39:47.380
But you fail to see that you already decided to talk to them

39:47.380 --> 39:50.380
by making yourself liable to that possibility.

39:50.380 --> 39:55.380
Of going in the environment where there is a good likelihood of people distracting you

39:55.380 --> 39:59.380
from your own basically self-awareness and solitude and so on.

39:59.380 --> 40:03.380
So now you can say, oh, so I'll never go to a library again.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.380
Well, that's also impossible.

40:04.380 --> 40:06.380
That's also trying to overdoing it.

40:06.380 --> 40:09.380
No, go to the library but for the right reasons.

40:09.380 --> 40:11.380
There might be a genuine need to go to a library,

40:11.380 --> 40:15.380
but it was the unwholesome part of your mind that made it into the unwholesome.

40:15.380 --> 40:18.380
Rooted it in unwholesome desire.

40:18.380 --> 40:21.380
Because yes, certain things you can abandon straight away.

40:21.380 --> 40:25.380
Engagement, sensuality, sexuality, lying, stealing, you abandon that.

40:25.380 --> 40:27.380
There is no wholesome way of doing that.

40:27.380 --> 40:30.380
But as the Buddha pointed out, there are things such as eating food.

40:30.380 --> 40:33.380
You can't stop that because you die.

40:33.380 --> 40:39.380
But if you eat it carelessly, if you're not aware of your reasons behind eating the food,

40:39.380 --> 40:44.380
if you don't keep those reasons present and clear, if you don't develop clarity in regard to them,

40:44.380 --> 40:50.380
inevitably you're going to eat out of greed and out of sensuality, out of enjoyment for taste,

40:50.380 --> 40:53.380
not need for the nutriments.

40:53.380 --> 40:57.380
And that's something you have to responsibly maintain each time you eat the food.

40:57.380 --> 40:59.380
And that's the whole point of that contemplation.

40:59.380 --> 41:05.380
I will eat for the sake of health and sustenance of the body, strength so I can continue practicing.

41:05.380 --> 41:10.380
I will not eat for beautification, I will not eat for sensual enjoyment, I will not eat for taste.

41:10.380 --> 41:13.380
But that's not something that's always written, like, decided for you.

41:13.380 --> 41:17.380
That's something that you choose to decide every time you go to eat food.

41:17.380 --> 41:21.380
So in this particular instance, all you need to do is be careless of you eating the food

41:21.380 --> 41:24.380
and immediately become central.

41:24.380 --> 41:27.380
If you're not careless, it doesn't go into sensuality.

41:27.380 --> 41:30.380
But people, that's that harder to maintain.

41:30.380 --> 41:35.380
So it's much easier to then just say, I'll not eat food or I'll only eat food that I hate and so on.

41:35.380 --> 41:38.380
That doesn't matter, you're still going to eat for unwholesome reasons then.

41:38.380 --> 41:43.380
Because the unwholesomeness of eating food for unwholesome reasons, it's not in the food.

41:43.380 --> 41:45.380
It's in your carelessness.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.380
So in the example of going to the library, no.

41:47.380 --> 41:53.380
You can still go to the library if you really need to get the suttas or other books that might help you contemplate further.

41:53.380 --> 41:56.380
But then you do it very, very carefully.

41:56.380 --> 41:59.380
Go to the hours when you know the Bombay people.

41:59.380 --> 42:02.380
If there are people of void looking at them.

42:02.380 --> 42:07.380
If you have to look at them, avoid talking to them even in the sake of being rude.

42:07.380 --> 42:11.380
And that's how you know you will not give rise to the unwholesome.

42:11.380 --> 42:14.380
But if you just say, I'll never step outside of my house.

42:14.380 --> 42:16.380
I'm going to be locked in this cell for three months.

42:16.380 --> 42:18.380
I will not talk to anybody ever again.

42:18.380 --> 42:20.380
You're just obscuring the problem.

42:20.380 --> 42:23.380
You're not going to see where the line of your responsibility is.

42:23.380 --> 42:26.380
Why? Because you're denying the whole thing.

42:26.380 --> 42:33.380
That's why the Buddha did make action sort of fence to engage in a practice of silence, not talking to anybody.

42:33.380 --> 42:39.380
Ever again, because they were like those ascetic surroundings that would just refuse to speak for the rest of their life.

42:39.380 --> 42:41.380
They said, well, it's misguided.

42:46.380 --> 42:49.380
But most people would just jump on the first excuse.

42:49.380 --> 42:51.380
Or why they need to go to the library?

42:51.380 --> 42:53.380
Oh, because together suttas and that's a good thing.

42:53.380 --> 42:54.380
Okay, fine.

42:54.380 --> 42:57.380
While the real reason remains underneath right there.

42:57.380 --> 42:58.380
But they refuse to look at it.

42:58.380 --> 43:04.380
Because then it will feel you will guilt, anxiety, sense of responsibility, which is already a burden.

43:06.380 --> 43:08.380
And that's where the practice is.

43:08.380 --> 43:10.380
I'm doing that burden.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.380
But in order to do the burden of responsibility, first you need to accept it.

43:13.380 --> 43:33.380
Not deny it.
