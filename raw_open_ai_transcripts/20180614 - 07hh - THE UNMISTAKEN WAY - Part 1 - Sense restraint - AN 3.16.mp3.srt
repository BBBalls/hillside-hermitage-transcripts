1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,720
Again, this is the Angutra, Bikku is possessing three qualities Bikku is practicing the

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,000
unmistakable and has laid the groundwork for the destruction of the tanks.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,640
While three, here are Bikku guards the doors of the sense faculties, observes moderation

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:32,640
in eating and is intent on wakefulness. And then it's number one. And how Bikku does

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,640
a Bikku guard the doors of the sense faculties. Here having seen a form with the eye, Bikku

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,720
does not grasp its marks and features, since if he left the eye faculty unrestrained, bad

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,720
unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him. He practices restraint over

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,280
it. He guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,600
a sound of the ear, having smelted odour with the nose, having tasted a taste. With the

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,760
tongue, having felt attacked our object with the body, having cognized the mental phenomenon

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,760
with the mind. Bikku does not grasp its marks and features, since if he left the mind

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,120
faculty unrestrained, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him.

13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,200
Bikku practices restraint over it. He guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,200
of the mind faculty. It is in this way that the Bikku guards the doors of the sense faculties.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:38,200
It's in terms of sensual restraint. And that seems to be the groundwork to begin practicing

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:46,800
a supermeditation, or wanting to be free from sensual irritation. So that you don't,

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,240
you don't necessarily have, you don't at all have to go and seek out beautiful objects.

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,880
And then practice this supermeditation. All you need to do is practice sensual restraint.

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Because the whole mind is already geared towards the mistake of sensuality. So even if you're

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,680
not actively seeking things with your senses, the mind and the thoughts and the way of

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,200
learning, it's already implying sensuality. So that's why you don't need to go and

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,200
prove to yourself that you just need to keep restraining until the knowledge in regard

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,880
to the nature of sensuality has fundamentally unattractive develops. And then of course

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,400
you won't have to prove anything because you've done it. That's how you go beyond senses

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,400
when you lose any form of concern with them, towards them, including concern of proving

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:50,280
that you're free from concern in regard to them. So if a thought comes up and image something

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,440
that you attract to you, which will inevitably happen exactly. So in order for those thoughts

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,320
of sensuality to become apparent, the actual senses must be well restrained beforehand.

29
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,520
That's why the winner, the sealer, comes first and that whole thing. So what you're saying

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,320
is to actually see the signs and features of it. Exactly, because sensuality is rooted

31
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,440
in those thoughts, but you're not seeing those thoughts because you're immediately out

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,280
with the senses seeking the pleasure. So that's the whole point of restraint. Like really

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,760
I'm wavering the strain, like you don't give in because if you do your undermining your

34
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,760
own clarity in regard to your own sensual thoughts, which means every time you give in,

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,160
you sort of induce more obscurity that you have to undo later. So that's why like seeing

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,560
the danger in the slightest fault. Because you know how hard it is to purify it and then

37
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,720
how hard it is to maintain it pure, yet that purity is necessary for any sort of insight

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,080
that you can develop in regard to the root of sensuality, which is the level of thoughts.

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
So if you want your thoughts, sensual thoughts to become apparent, to be seen through, as

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,600
founded upon the unattractive, the senses, the actual senses must be fully, fully restrained

41
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,800
beforehand. Then the mind becomes clearer. The mind affects the sensuality, the sensual

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,160
intent and so on. Or you will, the same. It becomes clearer when the body and the senses

43
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:26,440
have been restrained beforehand. So there is absolutely never a reason to give in to

44
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:34,140
non-restraint. If it's non-restraint means it's not done. Obviously, just restraining

45
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:40,840
senses in itself will not result in you understanding sensuality either. You need to know what to

46
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,080
look for, how to look for, what I described in the previous talk. You have to see the

47
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,600
unattractive basically in the heart of everything that's attractive, always. Like attractive

48
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,800
cannot step and become independent from unattractive. But if you don't see that, then yet, sense

49
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,000
restraint is good. And your mind will probably develop in various ways, but not to the point

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,360
of the right view and freedom from sensuality and so on. For that, you need a bit more.

51
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,000
But none of that will be available to be developed more if you don't have the sensual strength

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
beforehand.

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,600
So again, if this sensual thought arises and you pick up the signs and features of

54
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,280
sensual thought, you want to see that that sensual thought.

55
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,240
No matter what signs or features will be picked up, you also want to maintain the perception

56
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,640
of inherent foundations of disgust. So no matter where your mind goes, left or right

57
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,240
with those signs and features and prospects and possibilities, the unwavering perception

58
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,320
of it's still very much always within the container of unattractive disgust. You stop

59
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,240
assuming the external to it. You stop making it independent from any disgust, which is

60
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,520
when the mind gets pulled by a central craving. So that's what I mean. Like you have to see

61
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,600
it simultaneously present, not like going like a method or succession of steps or something

62
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
like that.

63
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,160
First, you restrain the senses. That's as much as a method as you're going to get. Like

64
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,640
don't negative method in a sense of you don't engage with a sensuality through your senses.

65
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,800
And then yes, when the mind inevitably thinks sensual thoughts, images, memories, the

66
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,400
signs and features of something, something beautiful that accidentally came across the

67
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,200
sound, the smell, the sight and so on, if the sensor is strained, then that you have

68
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,440
a groundwork now, which is the level of those thoughts that are picking up sensual signs.

69
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:51,920
So you want to basically learn how to simultaneously see the inseparable basis of disgust in regard

70
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,680
to any possibility of those sensual thoughts. Not this thought, that thought, or this particular

71
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,400
thought, any, just entirely in its nature and its domain. It's fully inseparable from

72
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,200
the unattractive. It's rooted in it, inconceivable from. And that's how you get to know it to

73
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
discern it.

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,400
And then you don't have to keep doing anything because whenever sensuality arises, it arises

75
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,920
with disgusting heart. And you can't want it at all, not even in your imagination anymore.

76
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,480
And that's how you would also understand that all the sensuality that has been in the past

77
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,480
that you did engage in, all the sensuality that you would even get, it's still the same

78
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,560
same nature, same everything cannot step outside of this basis, vessel of disgusted, fully

79
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:45,040
contained. In the same sense, slightly different than in the same sense, how Atawada ceases

80
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,840
when you see that external to the five aggregates is inconceivable. No matter what self-view

81
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,960
or what I have, what conceit, it's fully contained within the original experience as a whole,

82
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,360
which is the experience of the five aggregates. When you fully discern that, you will eventually

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,600
stop assuming any external dimension to it, which is basically the definition of Atawada,

84
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,960
a self that's external, that's independent of the five aggregates. And it's the same

85
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,320
principle in regards to assuming the external, beautiful, independent of the foundation

86
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:21,840
of the ugly, of not wanted, of this passion, which is why both are on the level of Upadana,

87
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:34,800
Atawada, and sensual, sensual desire.
