WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
So, what was your question, can you repeat it?

00:06.280 --> 00:07.280
Meditation.

00:07.280 --> 00:14.480
So, my question was that I didn't practice in meditation and I was here about meditations

00:14.480 --> 00:20.440
and I've done two different techniques but when you say meditation I don't really know

00:20.440 --> 00:25.520
like when then I do it, I don't know I just do it but if it's the proper way I'm doing

00:25.520 --> 00:32.080
it, if I'm just looking myself, it's just, um, my technique.

00:32.080 --> 00:41.100
One thing to get out of the way is only so-to-poin and can meditate properly so there is no

00:41.100 --> 00:48.560
samasama, without samadhi, so coming from that point of view you can see how silly the

00:48.560 --> 00:55.480
idea of a technique is that you can teach to others whereby they just emulate and mechanic

00:55.480 --> 01:00.960
properly repeat it, kind of leads automatically to wisdom or something.

01:00.960 --> 01:09.680
It doesn't, it leads to an experience of novelty or for kind and again, in connection

01:09.680 --> 01:15.640
to what I said half an hour ago, previous recording was repeating something thousands

01:15.640 --> 01:20.720
of times, right, based on your discernment, based on your faith, you know that these

01:20.720 --> 01:25.360
attending things like this is most likely right so you repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat,

01:25.360 --> 01:29.240
repeat thousands of times and then you get a confirmation, you get wisdom.

01:29.240 --> 01:33.920
You discern, oh it is right, what I've been doing.

01:33.920 --> 01:42.280
So getting a template technique that can sometimes somehow lead you to that right state

01:42.280 --> 01:49.760
is a rather, well it's obvious that it's kind of impossible because if I tell you a technique

01:49.760 --> 01:54.440
that works for everyone and everything, it doesn't mean it doesn't require you to be

01:54.440 --> 02:01.520
discerning anything, it just requires you to repeat these observances and these procedures

02:01.520 --> 02:06.800
that I prescribed for you, observe the nostrils when this happens, you do that, when you

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
do that.

02:07.800 --> 02:15.000
So it's not about like understanding, it's not about doing certain things, I'll tell

02:15.000 --> 02:19.640
you, you will understand, you will get knowledge, if you are mindful of your shoulders and

02:19.640 --> 02:25.640
you watch your breath in and you watch your breath out, how would it bring any understanding?

02:25.640 --> 02:31.320
At most that will make you experience certain things, oh a novelty experience of your body

02:31.320 --> 02:35.840
in this shape or that form or whatever else, but that is nothing to do with discerning

02:35.840 --> 02:40.800
and understanding because in order to discern and understand you need to know what you're

02:40.800 --> 02:44.400
supposed to discern and understand.

02:44.400 --> 02:52.360
If I tell you observe your act of breathing, seeing it as impermanent, seeing it as close

02:52.360 --> 02:58.440
of suffering, well that's a different thing, but that's not really a technique, isn't it?

02:58.440 --> 03:03.480
You can't say somebody, oh we'll try to understand things being given beforehand, which is

03:03.480 --> 03:07.760
the reason for you not being able to own them in the first place, you can't present that

03:07.760 --> 03:09.560
as a technique.

03:09.560 --> 03:14.120
I can say it, it can make sense to you, you can attend things like that, but that's

03:14.120 --> 03:18.560
the most that it can be and it doesn't need to be anything more than that.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.680
So you know, I know for a fact lots of people get upset when you dismiss the techniques

03:22.680 --> 03:25.680
or whatever they are, all the techniques have been helping me or whatever, what you as

03:25.680 --> 03:31.000
a protrusion, they have no criteria of what health is, your criteria is, it feels good,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.720
feels better.

03:33.720 --> 03:40.160
So the absolutely the first step is to get a right view, then you'll know how to meditate.

03:40.160 --> 03:44.000
So if you don't have a right view, then your meditation should be about gaffing the right

03:44.000 --> 03:59.720
view, because when you say that meditation is dwelling on the view that you have attained,

03:59.720 --> 04:04.320
dwelling on your right view, is meditation.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.120
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.800
So, but there is other meditation.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.480
There are many kinds of meditation, yeah, but only this one is the right one, as the Buddha

04:14.480 --> 04:20.120
said himself, I think we'll have spoke that well, I'll look at that and I said, you premeditated,

04:20.120 --> 04:24.280
overmeditated, undermeditated, mismeditated and so on, but he doesn't meditate and then

04:24.280 --> 04:30.440
he compares it to a dog waiting for a hair or a jackal or a cat waiting for a mouse praying

04:30.440 --> 04:32.880
upon something, that's usually what people's meditation is.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.560
And you realize, if you look at all these techniques that have been to, that is actually

04:36.560 --> 04:37.560
in common.

04:37.560 --> 04:42.920
It's all about by observing, observing, looking as close as possible, praying, waiting,

04:42.920 --> 04:46.040
waiting, and then it happens.

04:46.040 --> 04:52.440
So it's all about getting an experience of a novelty kind, anything.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.840
And no doubt you will sooner or later, why?

04:54.840 --> 04:59.920
Because all the efforts you're putting in, all the efforts are close observation, but all

04:59.920 --> 05:04.000
you're going to get is something you get when you look at things closer.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.600
But if that's all that's required for wisdom and niban and understanding, he wouldn't

05:08.600 --> 05:14.640
need the Buddha to tell you how to do it and the whole formulation of the dharma in like

05:14.640 --> 05:19.000
a great, great detail and so on, none of that would be necessary then for anyone.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.800
Because all you have to do is just look at things closer, if you look at things closer

05:24.800 --> 05:34.840
as a pathogener, with your ignorance, all you're doing is looking closer at your ignorance.

05:34.840 --> 05:41.040
And no knowledge can arise from that, because people are not going to think, you just need

05:41.040 --> 05:46.400
to chop everything, just sit and be like a baby, steal or whatever else.

05:46.400 --> 05:53.760
And don't judge, just go back to do whatever, promote the old state and that will teach you

05:53.760 --> 05:55.040
what you need to know.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.560
That's ridiculous.

05:56.560 --> 06:02.640
True and true, experience we talked about in being affected by a Vija means whatever you

06:02.640 --> 06:07.640
choose to stay with in your experience will be affected by that a Vija.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.120
Everything is corrupted for the Tujana.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.760
That's why I said, you can't accidentally step outside of your ignorance, why?

06:14.760 --> 06:18.880
Because a repetition is required.

06:18.880 --> 06:24.880
And in order to know that a repetition of something is the right thing, you get each other

06:24.880 --> 06:33.520
ignorance, you need to be told, then you need to do it.

06:33.520 --> 06:39.240
And doing is not just sitting and staring and waiting for things to teach you, because

06:39.240 --> 06:42.320
things are affected with ignorance as much as you are, why?

06:42.320 --> 06:46.080
Because they are part of your experience.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.000
So everything top to bottom is affected with a Vija.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.680
So even when you sit and meditate like that, all you're going to do is the meditate around

06:52.680 --> 06:55.760
your Vija.

06:55.760 --> 07:00.360
Which is not accidental that those people who are very much in technique will get upset

07:00.360 --> 07:04.640
if somebody dismisses their techniques.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.880
How would you get upset?

07:06.880 --> 07:12.600
So the Tujana can't get upset if somebody disparages the Dhamma or whatever it was at all.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.000
He will clearly know that person doesn't know what they're talking about, but he wouldn't

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
upset him.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
It's just impossible to take it personally.

07:22.000 --> 07:32.400
We said that also that the only, like if you're not assertive on it, during all sorts

07:32.400 --> 07:40.080
of techniques, the best thing you can do, which is a kind of meditation in a way, it's

07:40.080 --> 07:46.600
like trying to understand, to dwell on the suitors and go through them and to understand

07:46.600 --> 07:49.440
each point so thoroughly.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.440
That's an meditation in a proper sense of what?

07:51.440 --> 07:56.760
You're reflecting with your own experience, because again, like even the first jhana which

07:56.760 --> 08:01.120
is part of that meditation, it's thinking and pondering, or it's not an anomaly that

08:01.120 --> 08:06.560
is actually thinking and exploration of the right things.

08:06.560 --> 08:14.880
So it's just basically being whether you meditate or not, it's whether, when I say meditate,

08:14.880 --> 08:21.080
whether you sit down cross leg or whatever posture you prefer, you're doing the same thing.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.920
You're pursuing the right view and then the principles of the right view of the right

08:24.920 --> 08:25.920
insight.

08:25.920 --> 08:32.640
So you can do it more actively or more passively, but it's still the same thing.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.560
So when you get the right view, then you can sit in the summer and practice the summer

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
tab.

08:36.560 --> 08:40.320
But it doesn't mean forgetting about your right view and observing your kneecaps and shoulders

08:40.320 --> 08:45.720
and top of your head and roof or your mouth and nostrils and your lungs.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.720
It's just ridiculous.

08:46.720 --> 08:51.520
Well, you can observe those things correctly from the salayatuna point of view and then

08:51.520 --> 08:56.760
see how your body is just the composure of equal external element elements as the objects

08:56.760 --> 09:02.280
around you are, upon which you directly stand as a your mind, your personality, and everything

09:02.280 --> 09:03.280
else, and then disown it.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.280
Why?

09:04.280 --> 09:08.760
Because eyes, roof, your mouth, shoulder, kneecaps, is all given beforehand, what I was

09:08.760 --> 09:15.080
saying before, yet your life, as you know it, your past, your future, is inconceivable

09:15.080 --> 09:20.440
to be inseparable, to be independent of this living body.

09:20.440 --> 09:28.000
So this living body, less than two meters tall, full of organs, like a, like a, you know,

09:28.000 --> 09:33.120
a sack of, sack of beans tied at the top, which is different types inside, that is the

09:33.120 --> 09:34.120
reason.

09:34.120 --> 09:39.480
That is the necessary cause, necessary condition for your whole life, for early emotions,

09:39.480 --> 09:43.200
everything you've been through, everything you would go through, and you can't conceive

09:43.200 --> 09:45.600
it if there's no, not, not, not, not a living body.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.480
Thus, if that body comes to die, everything comes to an end, in that sense.

09:49.480 --> 09:57.320
To recognize that you have no input over that body, no say, no control over it.

09:57.320 --> 10:01.880
Any control you can exhibit is like what I spoke before, it's a movement along the given

10:01.880 --> 10:07.880
lines, before, they were given beforehand.

10:07.880 --> 10:12.000
So then you realize your whole life, whatever you've done, whatever you chose to do, your

10:12.000 --> 10:17.400
volition, it all determined by this external thing, it's because of it, over which you

10:17.400 --> 10:22.720
have no say, and now you can't ask for better meditation in that.

10:22.720 --> 10:26.400
Get that inside, get that thought, and then dwell on it, dwell on it, dwell on it.

10:26.400 --> 10:31.440
That's the repetition I was talking about, that's meditation, when meditation leads to wisdom,

10:31.440 --> 10:36.120
not when meditation leads to some mystical novelty states, oh, I fell this trembling,

10:36.120 --> 10:40.680
when I fell so peaceful, I fell this, I fell that, yeah, teach you get understanding

10:40.680 --> 10:42.880
at the end of your meditation.

10:42.880 --> 10:49.880
Lots of people don't have that kind of armor, I might give myself that, if you're sitting

10:49.880 --> 10:55.600
and to go and go watch your thought or think about a subject, what it seems to be better

10:55.600 --> 11:03.000
for a person, is writing it out and actually writing things, not for publication, but actually

11:03.000 --> 11:07.680
writing it out, describing it as I see it.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.920
In a way that's what I think I should be doing, obviously with my, because as I'm doing

11:10.920 --> 11:14.240
that writing, I have to bring most of that.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.240
You have to dwell on it.

11:15.240 --> 11:19.200
You have to dwell on it until it crystallizes to the extent that you're able to put it

11:19.200 --> 11:20.200
in the words.

11:20.200 --> 11:25.760
You don't just let it skim all of it, because you don't stop to kind of clarify anything

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
for yourself.

11:26.760 --> 11:33.640
It is clarifying, but it's difficult, because you're mind skipping this way that way.

11:33.640 --> 11:38.040
Exactly, because not used to clarifying the nature of things, so your meditation should

11:38.040 --> 11:44.520
enable you to do that, so it's not accidental that meditation results in the stillness

11:44.520 --> 11:45.520
of the mind.

11:45.520 --> 11:51.640
It means clarity increases, the mind is jumpy less, so you look at things more clearly.

11:51.640 --> 11:55.080
Again it's the same things you're trying to understand.

11:55.080 --> 12:00.600
People have this notion whereby, okay, you're trying to study, you contemplate, you reflect,

12:00.600 --> 12:03.520
and now it's a time for formal meditation.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.000
When you don't do that, you do formal meditation.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.200
What is formal meditation sitting down with your robot?

12:12.200 --> 12:17.040
What is formal meditation, following a technique, what is formal, like watching your breath

12:17.040 --> 12:18.040
or whatever?

12:18.040 --> 12:19.920
But why do you do all of that in the first place?

12:19.920 --> 12:22.960
Because you're going to be free from suffering.

12:22.960 --> 12:28.680
And who knows the way that leads you out of suffering, it's at least a certain point.

12:28.680 --> 12:35.880
So why don't you spend all of your time trying to become a certain person?

12:35.880 --> 12:39.280
And you will know how to meditate and what to do and how to do it.

12:39.280 --> 12:48.360
But I notice as well, like I struggle to do breath meditation, that's, you know, I try

12:48.360 --> 12:56.640
to do it, but then I don't mind one is off whatever, but if I write about it, I end up

12:56.640 --> 12:57.640
being calm.

12:57.640 --> 13:04.440
You know, because then I bring it, you do it in the end, that's the way I'm holding

13:04.440 --> 13:11.520
it all the time, so then, so it actually, I'm doing it without doing it the traditional

13:11.520 --> 13:17.280
way, you know, by writing about it.

13:17.280 --> 13:21.880
Tradition of way is a dignified way, because the tradition is written by people, by

13:21.880 --> 13:28.400
protugionists, by people who are not on the way to become out of house.

13:28.400 --> 13:35.040
And that's not just an empty dismissal, it's just that if you look at it, people who

13:35.040 --> 13:39.640
compile, compile commentaries and everything, they themselves said they were protugionists,

13:39.640 --> 13:42.800
famous commentaries and so on.

13:42.800 --> 13:51.280
You read the sutras, if the techniques were such a crucial factor, why would they never

13:51.280 --> 13:54.720
talk about it, why there is not a single technique?

13:54.720 --> 14:06.280
There's something I've got to notice as well, like the reason, what I can understand

14:06.280 --> 14:17.840
or what I can intellectually comprehend, is that the reason the arahats later on, doing

14:17.840 --> 14:25.120
write in the commentaries or they didn't do anything, it's just the putridionist that

14:25.120 --> 14:32.320
kept on writing things and adding things, is that they notice that they don't need

14:32.320 --> 14:34.600
for anything more than the sutras.

14:34.600 --> 14:40.880
More than enough, yeah, yeah, everything, all of the stuff that's been written later on,

14:40.880 --> 14:44.960
the preaching is now obscuring those things, because it's been written so long ago that

14:44.960 --> 14:48.720
now people take it to be the same.

14:48.720 --> 14:53.520
But you read the sutras and all the Buddha talks about all the time, he's understanding,

14:53.520 --> 14:58.600
developing, understanding, but he full understanding, he always results in full understanding, whatever

14:58.600 --> 15:02.920
approach of the practice you take, full understanding, what full understanding you get from having

15:02.920 --> 15:07.560
a mystical experience that overwhelms you, he's absolutely no understanding there, not

15:07.560 --> 15:09.440
even mindfulness often.

15:09.440 --> 15:16.440
So discernment, knowing the cause of suffering, like knowing the gratification, knowing the

15:16.440 --> 15:22.720
escape in regard to sensuality, in regard to various mental states, knowing the origin,

15:22.720 --> 15:29.840
knowing the gratification, knowing the escape, like knowing, like really, fully understanding,

15:29.840 --> 15:33.880
not analyzing, not getting all the facts, but fully understanding, penetrating with your

15:33.880 --> 15:38.400
mind, knowing it.

15:38.400 --> 15:47.280
And that's all, that's what it's all about, understanding the nature of things, understanding

15:47.280 --> 15:50.480
the nature of things, results in freedom from suffering.

15:50.480 --> 15:59.440
So I'm going back to my earlier question that, if I say, for the current state of mind

15:59.440 --> 16:08.080
if I'm being reflective about my thoughts and my actions, and if I'm trying to be as

16:08.080 --> 16:17.680
mindful as possible, is that meditation for my current state of mind?

16:17.680 --> 16:29.320
Yes, you can say that, but obviously be mindful as possible, again, the better you know

16:29.320 --> 16:34.640
what mindfulness is, the more established in mindfulness you are.

16:34.640 --> 16:41.960
So it's not just a state you emulate, you also want to understand what is presence of

16:41.960 --> 16:51.880
mind, what is the nature of it, what else appears there when I think I'm mindful.

16:51.880 --> 17:03.360
Well, mainly you're unsure, ignorance of what, what is, you see directly, you're not.

17:03.360 --> 17:11.000
You want to be, you want to be like investigating at the same time, not just kind of, when you

17:11.000 --> 17:14.560
sit and meditate, again, you want to meditate together as you.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.640
You can't get the right view accidentally, so you can't just sit and be mindful of here

17:18.640 --> 17:22.120
now, present moment, and then learn from it.

17:22.120 --> 17:25.720
The only way you can learn from it is if you know why you're supposed to learn, if you

17:25.720 --> 17:31.200
know why you're supposed to look for in things, otherwise you're just staying with your

17:31.200 --> 17:39.080
ignorance, and you'll be as ignorant on the thousand day as you were on a day one.

17:39.080 --> 17:43.720
So reading the sutras, and then if you want to sit and meditate the sutras, and then

17:43.720 --> 17:49.800
there will be parts that will kind of make sense to an extent, or at least seem promising

17:49.800 --> 17:55.320
that you might go, there is something to this, I could, what is in mind, I could perhaps

17:55.320 --> 18:02.200
understand is better, and then take that to your meditation, and then dwell on it in

18:02.200 --> 18:07.680
that sense that the Tanya was saying, don't just let it, you know, slip or slide, if you

18:07.680 --> 18:11.960
need to, you write it down or whatever, but you want to plurify it.

18:11.960 --> 18:15.680
And that's the thing, you know, I remember when I was doing work in meditation, and I got

18:15.680 --> 18:21.400
into a lot, and you kind of just, in a pondering on the sutras and various things, and I might

18:21.400 --> 18:27.480
have said this many times before, and you know, like the five aggregates, and then you

18:27.480 --> 18:32.680
just think about the five aggregates, but then it occurred to me, well, when I read the

18:32.680 --> 18:40.680
sutras that say consciousness or they talk about matter or feelings, why do I think

18:40.680 --> 18:49.480
did I understood by the thought, what consciousness refers to, what feelings refer to, whatever

18:49.480 --> 18:54.120
I, other aggregated with the mentions, why, why do I, why did I assume that I know what

18:54.120 --> 18:56.720
they're refers to?

18:56.720 --> 19:02.080
And then, then I started thinking, okay, so what is matter then, can I explain to myself

19:02.080 --> 19:07.800
what Rupa is in my experience right here, right now, while I'm explaining it?

19:07.800 --> 19:13.200
And then I went like that for every aggregate, and you realize that you don't really have

19:13.200 --> 19:20.880
a clear idea, you just assumed, you just picked up and you have a vague kind of ambiguous

19:20.880 --> 19:26.320
concocted concept of it, but if you stop and think, okay, when I say consciousness, consciousness

19:26.320 --> 19:32.080
or if I say feeling, feeling, what does that exactly stand for, is there a clarity that

19:32.080 --> 19:36.640
you don't know, and then you realize, well, that's what the practice is, undoing all these

19:36.640 --> 19:44.320
wrong views and wrong concepts and misconceptions and misconceiving the things, that you just

19:44.320 --> 19:50.120
stood for granted now, so now when even you come, even when you come to practice, the

19:50.120 --> 19:54.760
stuff you did in the sort of, well, you approach it with same polluted concepts, tools,

19:54.760 --> 19:59.440
not understood things, that you never question, you just start building on top of them, your

19:59.440 --> 20:05.840
practice of Dhamma, so it's no wonder you end up following weird, various intense techniques

20:05.840 --> 20:11.440
searching after praying upon like those animals in the sutras that the Buddha says, pray upon

20:11.440 --> 20:18.720
its prey, wait for it, for novelty states, for mystical experiences, take you over, as

20:18.720 --> 20:23.200
a form of validation or confirmation of what you've been doing, so your whole spiritual

20:23.200 --> 20:29.920
life would be misdirected, because you never actually re-evaluated the very kind of basics,

20:29.920 --> 20:34.400
and when you did, if you did, if you were, then you would realize, oh, the practice is

20:34.400 --> 20:39.600
actually in a completely different direction, it's the direction of undoing, so that things

20:39.600 --> 20:46.520
can be recognized correctly, not in finding out and rediscovering or something, like something

20:46.520 --> 20:50.880
has been obscured, and you just, no, it's, well, it was obscured, you can say it was obscured,

20:50.880 --> 20:57.720
by your own misconceiving, so you want to be able, that when you say to yourself, feeling

20:57.720 --> 21:02.960
feeling, that statement, that designation stands directly, for that which feeling is

21:02.960 --> 21:09.040
in your experience right there, and then, if there is no that clarity, that, well, there

21:09.040 --> 21:14.880
you go, there's a work laid out for you, and you can specifically take feelings, because

21:14.880 --> 21:19.760
craving is regard to feelings, and that's the whole point, learning how to feel and overcome

21:19.760 --> 21:27.200
the feeling, thus, never ever again, experiencing suffering, the Buddha said, my teaching is, for

21:27.200 --> 21:35.200
the one who feels, and he teaches only two things, suffering and fear for me.

21:35.200 --> 21:46.840
I actually find a bit of an advantage, personally, for me, that when I approach it, with both

21:46.840 --> 21:54.280
languages, it gives two different descriptions to each individual of the phrase, or it can

21:54.280 --> 21:59.240
be, yeah, we get closer, closer to the meaning, in a sense, when you kind of, you look at

21:59.240 --> 22:03.920
the parli, you learn the parli, then you look at different translations, different angles,

22:03.920 --> 22:07.800
that all becomes necessary, but not for a scholastic purpose, but for the purpose of

22:07.800 --> 22:13.400
clarifying, because you see, it's not about, again, finding out some, some, some, some divine

22:13.400 --> 22:20.560
providence, mystical light, it's about undoing, your wrong views, so that you recognize

22:20.560 --> 22:26.720
what the right view is, and when it comes to undoing, that's the whole point, you need

22:26.720 --> 22:33.560
to have as clear as possible, instruction, so you know what to look for, like the utterance

22:33.560 --> 22:39.000
of another, well, the Buddha's not around anymore, and, actually, even when he was, he referred

22:39.000 --> 22:44.440
to a miracle of instruction, so being able to convey the dhamma to somebody, and they

22:44.440 --> 22:49.440
fully understand it, and then become Arachandra Khandrava, equals to miracle, why bad will

22:49.440 --> 22:56.920
you see yourself, because we all take things in terminology, to mean, you know, sometimes

22:56.920 --> 23:04.320
completely, sometimes slightly different things, but even a slight variation in what it means

23:04.320 --> 23:09.480
for me, when I uttered it for him, can be quite a lot at the end of the line, like you

23:09.480 --> 23:17.000
imagine a boat or a ship is setting on a course, and in the beginning, you know, it doesn't

23:17.000 --> 23:21.320
matter if it's a meter to the left, a meter to the right, but after, you know, thousands

23:21.320 --> 23:26.800
of miles of journey, that tiny little kind of variation will result in missing a whole

23:26.800 --> 23:31.600
continent, so that's where you want to get as much, because you don't have a criteria

23:31.600 --> 23:41.880
about right or wrong, so you want to try to clarify for yourself as much as you can,

23:41.880 --> 23:49.440
so that then you kind of decrease the chances of being wrong, later on, or at least not

23:49.440 --> 24:11.480
go too far off, I like to, let's come to a mind from this, and I think in a mind from

24:11.480 --> 24:19.400
what that is, because this is thinking about it, clarifying that, which is quite helpful,

24:19.400 --> 24:23.520
because then you can look at things better, you can try to do certain things better once

24:23.520 --> 24:30.120
you know how to be mindful, because most people must be, must be, oh, I can be mindful,

24:30.120 --> 24:35.880
I've just been being here and now present, but then you kind of, then how do you, well

24:35.880 --> 24:40.720
exactly, because when you realize, yeah, you can be mindful, but if you have lots of wrong

24:40.720 --> 24:47.040
view, you'll be mindful with your wrong views, and it's actually quite true, when you

24:47.040 --> 24:52.760
take an average person sort of being mindful, if you were to us and to describe it, well,

24:52.760 --> 24:57.080
first of all, they probably wouldn't be able to, the second, it would all revolve around

24:57.080 --> 25:02.080
the wrong views of, as if I'm in the present moment, as if the present moment is sort

25:02.080 --> 25:09.920
of, in a constant change, constant flux that I step into, just to remind myself of mindfulness,

25:09.920 --> 25:16.240
then also another belief comes that, well, if I just have enough, a sufficient amount

25:16.240 --> 25:23.320
of mindful mind moments, then I'll be, I'll reach nibbana automatically or whatever else,

25:23.320 --> 25:30.600
but you realize, well, mindfulness is obviously the absolute necessity, but if you're not

25:30.600 --> 25:37.000
knowing where to, how to do your avidja, what you're going to be mindful is, or rather

25:37.000 --> 25:41.760
whatever you're mindful of, will be mindful of with your avidja, will be ignorant in regard

25:41.760 --> 25:44.520
to it.

25:44.520 --> 25:50.640
So mindfulness needs to, well, mindfulness and authenticity, like self-transparency, being

25:50.640 --> 25:56.760
honest to yourself, is the first step, feeds on the other, but if you're genuinely mindful,

25:56.760 --> 26:00.560
the first thing you're going to recognize is, I don't know, the second thing you can

26:00.560 --> 26:06.000
come to sort of recognize is, well, okay, what do I need to know then?

26:06.000 --> 26:12.040
And then you sort of start to narrow it down, you don't need to know everything, you just

26:12.040 --> 26:16.280
need to know suffering and freedom from it, so that's why your mindfulness should also

26:16.280 --> 26:22.560
be concerned there, with your feeling, what feeling is present, then it will become

26:22.560 --> 26:28.520
apparent that actually, well, for example, as I mentioned, the idea of the, the idea of

26:28.520 --> 26:32.560
the flock, the idea of, everything is constantly changing, it doesn't make sense because

26:32.560 --> 26:36.440
if everything is constantly changing, they wouldn't be any change at all, so when you're

26:36.440 --> 26:42.880
mindful, there is something, your experience is present as such, it's mindful, it's enduring,

26:42.880 --> 26:46.960
which means if you were to then say, oh, it's constantly changing or any other wrong

26:46.960 --> 26:52.040
view of that kind, that would mean you're adopting an external explanation to your present

26:52.040 --> 26:55.080
experience, that it's not validated by your mindfulness, your mindfulness tells you

26:55.080 --> 27:00.360
the contrary, which means you then ignore your mindfulness to explain it based on the

27:00.360 --> 27:06.600
views that you accepted beforehand, so then you want to stop doing that really and then

27:06.600 --> 27:11.280
develop mindfulness and then the views that come from what's evident in your mindfulness,

27:11.280 --> 27:15.600
there was a whole idea of phenomenology, like the philosophical movement of essential

27:15.600 --> 27:21.000
is basically describing only what's evident in a phenomenological art of which is the

27:21.000 --> 27:26.080
mindful art of mindfulness, and then if anything else would fall off, no matter how plausible

27:26.080 --> 27:32.160
it was, they would recognize, well, that's an explanation, and if it's an explanation means

27:32.160 --> 27:36.760
it's not actually coming from the direct mindfulness, direct description, direct understanding,

27:36.760 --> 27:43.880
as such it can be accepted, obviously, feminologists and essential philosophers couldn't arrive

27:43.880 --> 27:53.480
at greater conclusions, but it's a valid method, because in that case, if you were to do

27:53.480 --> 27:59.120
it, you can't, like, you know, you can go off the tracks a bit, left or right, but you

27:59.120 --> 28:05.240
can't go off too far, because this principle of being based upon mindfulness is not abandoned,

28:05.240 --> 28:12.240
so it will always bring you back and restart, but that means person will have to be willing

28:12.240 --> 28:21.320
to completely let go, challenge, abandon his own most personal views, let alone not

28:21.320 --> 28:26.280
get angry over it, or upset, or argumentative, but really genuinely whenever he approaches

28:26.280 --> 28:31.200
to the new view, or to the view that sort of challenges his own view, he approaches

28:31.200 --> 28:37.640
it with a sense as something that might be right, and it might has to be accepted, which

28:37.640 --> 28:43.120
means that what he has now, even if it's years of practice invested, are always in question,

28:43.120 --> 28:50.880
because that's what mindfulness is, but if you do it like that, then the solid core

28:50.880 --> 28:58.160
will actually remain, and you will be abandoning everything unnecessary, everything wrong,

28:58.160 --> 29:04.640
while the right things will stay there, why, because they were right, but it's not easy,

29:04.640 --> 29:15.440
I mean, it comes to a point where you experience fear by reading different views, by reading

29:15.440 --> 29:21.520
views that are challenging yours, by talking to people that are saying you're wrong,

29:21.520 --> 29:27.240
like genuine existential anxiety, fear, it's not, it's not optional, holding views, it's

29:27.240 --> 29:33.360
not optional, like views are what you are, it's kind of your own foundation, so challenging

29:33.360 --> 29:39.720
them feels like you're really shaking your own foundation, well that's what most people

29:39.720 --> 29:44.560
get angry, exactly, if you say I'm a meditation technician nonsense, how dare you say that,

29:44.560 --> 29:50.840
I've been meditating for 20 years, well good for you, why do you get angry on a kind of

29:50.840 --> 29:56.080
it, meditation is supposed to free you from greed, aversion, delusion, why are you getting

29:56.080 --> 30:04.640
angry now, because of your meditation, that's a contradiction in terms, so you either

30:04.640 --> 30:09.600
haven't been meditating rightly since you're not free from anger, or the Buddha was wrong,

30:09.600 --> 30:19.000
so which one it is, we all know which one it is, so if I recognize that I don't have

30:19.000 --> 30:25.840
any mindfulness, and in order to develop it, if I keep reflecting as much as I can, like

30:25.840 --> 30:30.880
as the moment passes, oh, see there you go, what moment passes, not the moment passes,

30:30.880 --> 30:36.840
nothing like, more like the moment that I pass, reflect, keep reflecting like on my actions,

30:36.840 --> 30:45.760
as passes I can, no, see again, as fast, what, you're chasing something, are things moving

30:45.760 --> 30:50.120
out, like if you don't see them immediately, are they gone, how can you think of them

30:50.120 --> 30:56.640
then, even as gone, if they were gone, well if I can only, like I can't, we recognize

30:56.640 --> 31:03.160
it as being a rising, but just, what do you mean, well exactly, so if you can't see the

31:03.160 --> 31:10.560
point of origin, I think, if you can only find it as originated, what is that chase, why

31:10.560 --> 31:19.440
why do you have to be fast, in any way, it's already there, and it's still there, and

31:19.440 --> 31:26.480
it's persisting there, can I call that a mindfulness, or is that just a reflection, well that's

31:26.480 --> 31:34.440
mindful reflection, that's mind, it's inseparable, sati recollected, sati sampajana, mindfulness

31:34.440 --> 31:43.320
and awareness, sati is the same word used for memory, so that's the whole, this whole

31:43.320 --> 31:49.040
misconception of kind of observing the external moment, chasing them, being fast, quick,

31:49.040 --> 31:58.840
fast, the completely misguided view, if it's truly past, it's inconceivable, you can't

31:58.840 --> 32:05.200
even think about it, you can't even speak about it in a past tense, it's gone, but the

32:05.200 --> 32:10.800
fact that you can, means it's not gone, means it still persists, while it's changing on

32:10.800 --> 32:18.800
some level, so you recognize that, you recognize the stillness within the particular movement,

32:18.800 --> 32:28.400
you stay with the stillness, you're mindful of the movement, but if you go after the movement,

32:28.400 --> 32:33.200
well, you're pulverated, you're done, and again, the symbol in the suit is a man who needs

32:33.200 --> 32:39.960
to keep an eye on, I don't know, 20, 30, I don't know, 5,000 of children, he can't possibly

32:39.960 --> 32:44.480
go around chasing after every one of them, if he does, he'll exhaust himself, even if

32:44.480 --> 32:48.800
he doesn't, he can see only one at the time, the one that he is chasing, which means the

32:48.800 --> 32:57.040
other 49 children are not, he's not mindful of, so he recognizes that instead of chasing

32:57.040 --> 33:03.120
individually, he finds a slightly elevated ground from which he can see them all at once,

33:03.120 --> 33:07.400
so he's not particularly involved with any one of them, but he can see them, so if one

33:07.400 --> 33:14.280
of them goes too far, he calls them back, and that's like the basic practice of mindfulness

33:14.280 --> 33:19.880
which is the practice of meditation, there is no, some other, there is no meditation of

33:19.880 --> 33:28.080
any kind, without mindfulness as a foundation, he's basically sitting down, you can, I don't

33:28.080 --> 33:34.080
know, be mindful of your breathing if you want, but don't sweat it, so to speak, but be

33:34.080 --> 33:38.720
mindful of what you're thinking while you're sitting down, while you're seated, to be

33:38.720 --> 33:43.560
more precise, but then don't try to be kind of chasing your thoughts of grower, or seeing

33:43.560 --> 33:47.480
where they originate, or look for every moment of your thoughts, because they will assume

33:47.480 --> 33:52.120
you being external to your own thoughts, or your thoughts external to it, but you are

33:52.120 --> 33:58.040
your thoughts, so once you're mindful of them as what has a reason, or these thoughts are

33:58.040 --> 34:03.880
present, leave it, just don't, don't, don't, don't, try kind of holding it tightly, trying

34:03.880 --> 34:12.240
to see every like microscopic moment, because there is no such thing, that's an assumption,

34:12.240 --> 34:16.280
what you have is such thought is present, then another thought is present, so you don't

34:16.280 --> 34:21.320
want to interfere with it directly, but you don't want to lose sight of it completely,

34:21.320 --> 34:26.160
again, you don't want to be chasing all those children all the time, you want to step

34:26.160 --> 34:33.160
back so that you can see them more, more of them, without, so you're not chasing directly,

34:33.160 --> 34:37.640
but you're not, not looking at them either, so that's the attitude you want to have with

34:37.640 --> 34:44.480
your own mind, your own thoughts, when you sit down and meditate, let things arise, don't

34:44.480 --> 34:48.440
interfere with it, because it's nothing to do with you in the first place, but then don't

34:48.440 --> 34:53.560
lose the sight of it completely, and that's a practice in itself, practice of mindfulness,

34:53.560 --> 34:58.960
practice of meditation, practice that can bring the discernment, thus, although even as

34:58.960 --> 35:03.000
a protusion, you can be emulating things rightly, and if you emulate it long enough, it will

35:03.000 --> 35:09.160
lead to the right results, so keeping a peripheral sight, keeping a corner of your eye on

35:09.160 --> 35:15.920
your thoughts, is basically how you establish yourself in mindfulness, that allows other

35:15.920 --> 35:22.440
things to arise, as this will change, in front of you directly, but at the back of your

35:22.440 --> 35:30.720
mind, there is still a corner of your eye looking at it, so peripheral vision, you don't

35:30.720 --> 35:39.360
stare at things that I can only see them, you need an example of a, like a dancer, you

35:39.360 --> 35:45.040
stand by the gate, yeah, yeah, there we go, yeah, there is a certain, yeah, and you don't

35:45.040 --> 35:50.840
, you don't shift the person and check, because you know what, you know, you figure out,

35:50.840 --> 35:55.000
you understand, you discern beforehand, if whoever comes in, whoever goes out to have

35:55.000 --> 36:00.120
to come to here, and that's all you have to do, just stay there, whoever came in, you

36:00.120 --> 36:04.680
don't go after them, you know, they're in, that's all I need to know, whoever goes out,

36:04.680 --> 36:10.680
you know, they're out, that's all I need to know, if something, there is a temptation,

36:10.680 --> 36:15.680
it pulls you once you go in, you resist that, why, because you know, well, I leave this

36:15.680 --> 36:21.720
entry point, this door, this sole entry point, I will lose a sight of everything else, so

36:21.720 --> 36:28.240
you don't leave that, so it's like mindfulness of the feelings, or mindfulness of the nature

36:28.240 --> 36:33.880
of your thoughts, which means you don't have to be mindful and concerned with every particular

36:33.880 --> 36:39.160
thought, for as long as you're mindful of the thought is there, in the same sense with

36:39.160 --> 36:43.560
the body, you know, to be mindful of the body internally, externally, internally, externally,

36:43.560 --> 36:51.480
mindfulness, mindfulness, all, he's mindful of the body is there, to be extended, necessarily

36:51.480 --> 36:58.120
for the final knowledge, so you know, such a general thought, ah,

36:58.120 --> 37:07.080
body is there, he sees that always peripherally, because the body is always there, whatever situation

37:07.080 --> 37:14.760
you're in, good or bad, neutral, left or right, up or down, your body is there, peripherally,

37:14.760 --> 37:21.200
you know, you, you, 99% of your attention can be taken by whatever else, but in that

37:21.200 --> 37:25.640
distance, peripheral distance, there is still a reclamation, there is still knowledge

37:25.640 --> 37:30.680
of all is there, and that's your anchor of your mindfulness, which means that these 99%

37:30.680 --> 37:35.800
cannot actually take you away, cannot overwhelm you, why? because there is still that 1% anchor,

37:35.800 --> 37:40.800
proper, and that's what anchor is, you throw an anchor, you let it sink, and then you forget

37:40.800 --> 37:49.800
about it, in a sense that you're not constantly pulling it up and throwing it in, pulling it

37:49.800 --> 37:56.240
up, because that's pointless, and that's what meditation does, I end up doing it, I'll

37:56.240 --> 38:01.880
just get back to the moment, get back to the moment, get back to the present moment, why?

38:01.880 --> 38:05.200
You get back to the present moment, when you completely forgot about it, you get back

38:05.200 --> 38:13.840
to it so that you can let it go, let it take its course, while you remain slightly

38:13.840 --> 38:19.600
anchored in it, I peripherally keep an eye on it, so you throw an anchor, and then you

38:19.600 --> 38:26.800
let the boat float away, and when an anchor is established properly, the boat will not float

38:26.800 --> 38:34.960
away too far, or it will float away as far as the anchor allows it to, but the common

38:34.960 --> 38:40.120
contemporary techniques basically will translate into throwing an anchor, and pulling it up,

38:40.120 --> 38:47.000
and throwing it in for the sake of doing it, so you can never ever get a concept of mindfulness,

38:47.000 --> 38:55.040
concept of things enduring, persisting while changing, movement within thing that is still,

38:55.040 --> 38:59.440
why? Because you're constantly just joking left and right, just throwing it, throwing it,

38:59.440 --> 39:04.440
throwing it, throwing it, throwing it, throwing it, what's the best tool point, you know,

39:04.440 --> 39:09.840
because even trying to think about what the body is, you can't lose ground, but you know,

39:09.840 --> 39:14.960
different times are different, that's why there's so many, like different foundations of

39:14.960 --> 39:21.160
mindfulness, but what you're saying, like also what you're saying, experience as a whole,

39:21.160 --> 39:27.480
you don't, you don't, you don't come across that term in the sutras, you've got the feeling

39:27.480 --> 39:35.840
of mind, but when I hear experience as a whole, and I see that God, we experience as a whole,

39:35.840 --> 39:43.080
it's happening now, that phenomenon, my experience as a whole, it seems to be easier to come on.

39:43.080 --> 39:48.560
Again, I think that just depends on the person, yeah, but even within the same person, sometimes

39:48.560 --> 39:53.880
you'll need to, you'll need to do different things, because sometimes, you know, like the

39:53.880 --> 39:58.640
habit of ignorance, we still prevail, and then you'll end up just like not, not, not

39:58.640 --> 40:02.440
getting the same mind, so you have to, that's why there's so many different approaches,

40:02.440 --> 40:07.080
different types, sometimes just to refresh your mind, you would, you would take a different

40:07.080 --> 40:10.560
approach, sometimes different approach will make more sense than the previous approach.

40:10.560 --> 40:15.200
The point is, the principles of those approaches remain the same, the principle of mindfulness,

40:15.200 --> 40:18.880
the principle of understanding, the principle of determinations, all of those remains the

40:18.880 --> 40:23.800
same, but it doesn't really matter what particular manifestation of the principle you're

40:23.800 --> 40:29.000
engaging in, or as long as you're aiming at the principle, it's all contributing towards

40:29.000 --> 40:38.360
the same understanding, because why I like that experience as well, because I can't

40:38.360 --> 40:46.040
doubt that I'm experiencing, but I can doubt, is this my body, is that my body, you know

40:46.040 --> 40:51.920
it, but the body is there, you can't doubt, because all of these movements in regard to

40:51.920 --> 41:01.840
that body, is this, is this, is that, is that possible, because that body is a reason?

41:01.840 --> 41:05.160
Yeah, sure, once you get it, once you come, because yeah, as it, as it, experience the whole

41:05.160 --> 41:11.200
watching that, nothing else, nothing's going to happen without, it happening within that

41:11.200 --> 41:17.680
experience, so it's guarding experience, you, and once you get used to guarding it, then

41:17.680 --> 41:22.960
you can start making the effort within that and discerning it, so within that experience

41:22.960 --> 41:27.680
as a whole, what is feeling, when I say feeling feeling, what does that stand within that

41:27.680 --> 41:32.760
experience as a whole that I'm already mindful of, so you're creating like a ground on

41:32.760 --> 41:40.880
which you can start doing the work, because it has to be something, and you're referring

41:40.880 --> 41:46.000
to feeling feeling what does that designation stand for, what does it aim at, what does

41:46.000 --> 42:02.280
it signify, and you want to clarify that, does that mean I'm, again, paying attention

42:02.280 --> 42:08.760
to one child, though, well that means you're doubting what's also, what's an also, if you're

42:08.760 --> 42:12.280
paying attention to feel like it's also my also, and if you don't know if it's also my

42:12.280 --> 42:23.840
also, so what you want to do is develop criteria, all of your mindfulness whereby recognizing

42:23.840 --> 42:28.600
being mindful of something will already know if what you're mindful of is also my own

42:28.600 --> 42:45.720
also, what's the criteria, well the criteria would be the right view, so reflection of an

42:45.720 --> 42:46.040
action to be holding on, holding has to happen at a different time, well it can happen

42:46.040 --> 42:49.600
through that, for as long as you don't deceive yourself into thinking that you already

42:49.600 --> 42:55.400
know what's awesome, what's some awesome, only a person with the right view knows

42:55.400 --> 43:02.720
this wholesome as wholesome, unwholesome as unwholesome, there's a tutor again, a two time

43:02.720 --> 43:09.000
to thought, and he devised, the Buddha did, well, previous, before, he's not the Buddha

43:09.000 --> 43:15.920
yet, but he devised his thoughts into two cards, that was his thought connected with

43:15.920 --> 43:27.240
him, he'll go through the version, the version Alice, and then thought connected to non-heal

43:27.240 --> 43:36.640
will, non-culti and renunciation, but then he reflects, is this what I'm doing, good for

43:36.640 --> 43:44.520
me, good for another, does it bring about wisdom, and then it all, is it not good for me,

43:44.520 --> 43:50.560
not good for another, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be sure, very flexible, through those questions

43:50.560 --> 43:57.720
that kind of, then he knows that this is, this is wholesome, this doesn't disturb me,

43:57.720 --> 44:05.200
it doesn't disturb anyone else, and I'm, my understanding is developing wisdom, so he,

44:05.200 --> 44:17.440
but that's the criteria you can trust, even in the potusion, and you can see that none

44:17.440 --> 44:21.960
of the techniques you would be doing in terms of meditation would come under that, always

44:21.960 --> 44:28.480
than you're developing by watching a nostril, makes you feel good, makes you feel good,

44:28.480 --> 44:32.320
so really it comes down to discernment, mental discernment, something that you cannot

44:32.320 --> 44:39.040
put into a method, so you need to cause, oh, is what I'm doing, what I'm thinking, would

44:39.040 --> 44:47.600
that be harm, would that imply, is that connected, harming others, harming me, harming both,

44:47.600 --> 44:54.000
harming neither, okay, it doesn't seem this harming neither, but then is it also making me

44:54.000 --> 44:59.640
discern things, is it making things clearer, so when I say feeling, feeling or when I say

44:59.640 --> 45:04.040
perception, perception, doing no, what those things stand for clearer, and there is one

45:04.040 --> 45:08.520
thing in these things out, is because those things are the five aggregates, and the five aggregates

45:08.520 --> 45:15.600
are the ones affected with assumptions, with the wrong views, you do padana, so even in

45:15.600 --> 45:20.520
your speech in designation, that's all form of, of, of, of, of padana, can be, if it stands

45:20.520 --> 45:27.720
for wrong things, it expresses the wrong things, the wrong assumptions, so you want to have

45:27.720 --> 45:33.560
things clear for you, not explained, not laid out, like, like, as a, as a nice little tidy

45:33.560 --> 45:38.160
chart, a map of things, oh, this is what it is, this is what it is, you know, you want to

45:38.160 --> 45:43.840
know exactly when you use after a designation, you know what it stands for, phenomenologically.

45:43.840 --> 45:50.280
That's why I reckon, so that's what means like developing the sermon, developing wisdom,

45:50.280 --> 45:54.880
that's what it's necessary, and you have to keep thinking like that, because if you are,

45:54.880 --> 45:58.280
well, you will at least be striving in the right direction, but if you don't see that

45:58.280 --> 46:03.640
as a criteria, developing that kind of wisdom, then exactly, then you can, yeah, what,

46:03.640 --> 46:08.400
watching, watching my nostrils, doesn't harm anyone, doesn't harm me, doesn't harm others,

46:08.400 --> 46:19.720
so it's great, well, exactly, it doesn't, and when it comes to developing wisdom and understanding,

46:19.720 --> 46:25.600
there is no method you can engage in, as I said before, it just doesn't work like that.

46:25.600 --> 46:40.400
It's, it's, it's to each individual, and it's also understanding in this sermon of

46:40.400 --> 46:46.880
the nature of things precedes the designation, the nature of designation, so you can hear

46:46.880 --> 46:53.120
the instruction, but then you understand what it pretends to, it precedes it, that's

46:53.120 --> 46:59.040
why the Buddha referred to it as miracle, so that connection is something through your own

46:59.040 --> 47:05.680
efforts can become apparent, and you're so responsible for that, which means even the

47:05.680 --> 47:13.440
instruction utterance of another can go only so far, but then me designating you a set

47:13.440 --> 47:20.120
of, set of methods and observances you go through, and then you just adhering to it, that

47:20.120 --> 47:24.800
can that somehow magically lead you onto that connection, that you, your self-responsive

47:24.800 --> 47:28.600
connection understanding, that doesn't, doesn't work, which is why it's wrong, it's a

47:28.600 --> 47:37.240
fetter, seal about the Paramasa, holding onto virtue and duty, like people translate that

47:37.240 --> 47:43.680
seal about the Paramasa is holding onto rights and rituals, whereby it means rights and rituals,

47:43.680 --> 47:49.400
and that that's kind of obvious, we all know that, you know, piling to the random stone

47:49.400 --> 47:54.200
shrines doesn't mean anything, so we all abandon that fetter, we just do it for whatever

47:54.200 --> 47:59.000
reasons, but we know it's not the practice, but actually the, the pali is seal about the

47:59.000 --> 48:06.920
Paramasa, seal is the virtue and duty, seal about the Paramasa means holding onto the

48:06.920 --> 48:14.400
sense of virtue and duty, and basically holding onto thinking, your seal, your purity,

48:14.400 --> 48:20.760
your valid, genuine purity is what practice is, holding onto, onto your sense of duty as

48:20.760 --> 48:24.320
somebody who practices the Buddhist teaching, or I should be doing this, I should be meditating,

48:24.320 --> 48:29.560
I should be holding onto that to be the practice, all of that is a fetter, why, because that's

48:29.560 --> 48:35.200
not the practice, and it did say, there is no dhamma without vinaya, but vinaya is not

48:35.200 --> 48:41.520
dhamma, and dhamma is not vinaya, but obviously you need vinaya in order to be able to practice

48:41.520 --> 48:52.360
dhamma correctly, but dhamma is not vinaya, dhamma is not seal, so even your preset,

48:52.360 --> 48:57.280
you need to be pure, you need to be kept, and nothing to do with dhamma, you can ignore

48:57.280 --> 49:01.520
that, dhamma is elsewhere, and if you look at it, why, well it's obvious, because

49:01.520 --> 49:09.560
presets are something you do, you observe techniques are something you do, you perform, but understanding

49:09.560 --> 49:16.760
of the nature of things is something you cannot do, you cannot perform, this is completely

49:16.760 --> 49:23.400
different domain, obviously the understanding of the nature of things cannot happen, if

49:23.400 --> 49:29.680
your behavior has not be purifying externally to keep in the presets and not engaging in

49:29.680 --> 49:39.960
maintaining and wholesome things through those bad habits, but that purification through

49:39.960 --> 49:45.120
that behavior is not the understanding, because you can be as pure as, you know, anything

49:45.120 --> 49:50.800
that comes, but still not understand things, so there is no guarantee of understanding

49:50.800 --> 50:00.280
through following methods or observances or duties, why, because that's not what understanding

50:00.280 --> 50:05.840
is, it obviously like, you know, that does not mean that, oh I can do whatever I want

50:05.840 --> 50:13.320
and get in the standing, well if you didn't understand things, when things were favourable

50:13.320 --> 50:19.840
for you, when you were keeping the presets, where you are not increasing the greater version

50:19.840 --> 50:22.960
of the illusion, well then you are certainly not going to understand when your behavior

50:22.960 --> 50:28.160
is increasing the greater version of the illusion, hence it's a necessary prerequisite,

50:28.160 --> 50:38.200
but it's not it, so you can see why then like thinking, oh certain prescribed technique

50:38.200 --> 50:43.360
or can you, Ajahn, can you give me a technique or something I can do that will lead me to,

50:43.360 --> 50:49.400
you know, magical place of Arhantji, it's actually a very serious, wrong view because

50:49.400 --> 50:55.000
it becomes an impediment, because you think that you are actually practicing by observing

50:55.000 --> 51:00.760
this mechanical technique, which means that's where your effort stopped, you don't stop

51:00.760 --> 51:06.440
and then start reflecting on that, the nature of what you're doing, which is what understanding

51:06.440 --> 51:11.080
is, no you're just doing it, just doing it, I just repeating, budo, budo, budo, budo,

51:11.080 --> 51:16.240
like a robot and that brings me full understanding of stuff, yeah right, if that brings you

51:16.240 --> 51:20.320
into understanding then the whole tipitaka would be just budo, budo, budo, budo, budo,

51:20.320 --> 51:23.520
budo, budo, budo, wherever you're opening or whatever you're paying to open it, but

51:23.520 --> 51:29.280
it's not, not even once, never the budo say you just repeat this mantra and it will establish

51:29.280 --> 51:36.800
you in mindfulness, many other followers and the emptyages of different sects and religions

51:36.800 --> 51:45.160
said that, and they were all mentioned as wrong, right, because nothing may happen,

51:45.160 --> 51:50.840
any mechanical such as repeating, budo, budo, or watching the tip of your nose or can

51:50.840 --> 51:55.640
bring understanding, the only thing that can bring understanding is your attitude that's

51:55.640 --> 52:01.080
trying to understand, and that attitude can be in regard to anything that is established

52:01.080 --> 52:07.840
upon wholesome, hence the meditation techniques, well they're wrong because people think

52:07.840 --> 52:12.640
them, take them to be right, but in themselves they're not even wrong, they're absolutely

52:12.640 --> 52:17.680
pointless, you can be watching your nostrils or not, what's the point, you can watch tips

52:17.680 --> 52:24.120
of your ears, like the budo, when he's teaching, he's talking about these things, certain

52:24.120 --> 52:31.160
things, you know, five days with the followers, he's talking about these things, and people

52:31.160 --> 52:35.440
understand, they get people from something, because they're understanding the designations

52:35.440 --> 52:42.280
that he's using when he says, he's not ringing a bell, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, and

52:42.280 --> 52:47.000
they will become our hands, right there and then by listening to them with a speak, not

52:47.000 --> 52:53.200
by watching their nose for three hours, and then we go walking, yeah, understanding what

52:53.200 --> 52:57.240
he's talking about, isn't it, actually paying attention, paying attention to designations

52:57.240 --> 53:05.080
that he's using, and then seeing them for what they are in their own experience, they

53:05.080 --> 53:11.920
have the right attitude, trying to understand, and the designations that himself were operating

53:11.920 --> 53:17.800
were not as polluted as most of other people today's designations are, so then it's nothing

53:17.800 --> 53:22.640
magical about people becoming our hands upon listening to budo speak, oh, well, you know,

53:22.640 --> 53:26.040
the budo knew their mind, yeah, sure, but that's not the reason why they became our hands,

53:26.040 --> 53:31.280
they became our hands because they understood what he was saying, right, so if now you don't

53:31.280 --> 53:35.240
understand what the budo is saying in the sutras is because you just have so many obstructions

53:35.240 --> 53:41.400
and assumptions of your own doing, which you're fully responsible, obscuring the meaning

53:41.400 --> 53:50.360
of the sutras, so undo your own assumptions, undo your own designations to the extent necessary

53:50.360 --> 53:55.440
whereby you read the sutras and it's directly describing your experience, when that's

53:55.440 --> 53:59.960
the case, 100% you'll be an arah, because every sutra describes experience of an arah

53:59.960 --> 54:03.960
or how to be humble.

54:03.960 --> 54:12.440
If you read a sutra and it seems like common sense, oh, that means you have some serious

54:12.440 --> 54:20.200
work to do, and yellow to people say, well, this is just common sense, it's just repetition.

54:20.200 --> 54:24.840
If you think of it just in terms that I said, imagine if every designation of the budo

54:24.840 --> 54:30.440
would use stands for direct description of your experience, then him repeating it through

54:30.440 --> 54:36.760
different aspects of it would be bringing it in your experience, one aspect within the

54:36.760 --> 54:40.840
other, within the other, within, so you can see it's almost like a natural progression

54:40.840 --> 54:46.880
of understanding, like fortifying it in regard to this, in regard to this, within that,

54:46.880 --> 54:54.080
within this, you realize the sutras are far from just repetitive kind of tautological

54:54.080 --> 55:00.080
folklore descriptions of something, it's actually direct phenomenological instruction

55:00.080 --> 55:05.680
and like leading on further and further and further in developing of your understanding

55:05.680 --> 55:12.960
and your purification of your own designations, they were carrying around assumptions.

55:12.960 --> 55:20.160
So if you approach it directly, rather correctly, if you approach it correctly, we derive

55:20.160 --> 55:27.280
view and phenomenological mindfulness establish reading the sutras would be like directly

55:27.280 --> 55:33.000
purifying your own experience while you're reading them, because that's what they are.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.440
Hence repeating it for 20 times would be 20 repetitions of purifications, 6 times, 12

55:39.440 --> 55:43.520
times, 18 times, no matter how many times it will be, you would read it and each time it

55:43.520 --> 55:50.880
would be a purified image of a correct designation, things standing correctly for what they are.

55:50.880 --> 55:56.960
So reading the sutras becomes the direct practice, the direct insight.

55:56.960 --> 56:03.440
Which is how it was when the Buddha was speaking, to those who became sotapanas or arahants

56:03.440 --> 56:11.880
upon listening.

56:11.880 --> 56:18.280
So that's why repetition in the sutras, because it's not explaining, it's a direct description

56:18.280 --> 56:23.080
of your experience and if you repeat it 6 times in regard to every sense, that's how

56:23.080 --> 56:27.280
it needs to be seen, repetitively in regard to every sense.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.280
Why?

56:28.280 --> 56:34.280
Because if you leave a sense and turn, ignorance will stay there.

56:34.280 --> 56:54.080
Yeah, far from, okay, we're talking about the other day, but John has been, you know,

56:54.080 --> 57:00.880
by thinking and pondering in the correct way, one enters the John's, because you know,

57:00.880 --> 57:07.080
he secluded from unhulsing states, you guiding your mind, so you notice I'm secluded from

57:07.080 --> 57:11.600
awesome states, anything has to come through, has to come through here, I'm really straining

57:11.600 --> 57:19.080
my senses, my senses are guarded, and then you enter, well, they've become joy and so

57:19.080 --> 57:20.080
on.

57:20.080 --> 57:24.080
So it's just, there is no blanking out ever.

57:24.080 --> 57:30.120
No, no, no, no, no, you know, the sutra one by one, I think it was 109, am I doing

57:30.120 --> 57:31.120
that?

57:31.120 --> 57:36.240
About Sadi Puthas going through different sort of establishments of his mind, the first

57:36.240 --> 57:40.200
John, the second John, the third John and so on, all the way up to station perception

57:40.200 --> 57:48.040
field, and every of those states had mindfulness, first John, the second mindfulness there,

57:48.040 --> 57:55.440
fully established, just fortifying that same mindfulness, which is not like completely the opposite

57:55.440 --> 58:00.080
of what people expect to achieve through various meditation techniques, when you're just

58:00.080 --> 58:06.680
not aware of anything, is it sorry, I went to the state, I went to the state of neither

58:06.680 --> 58:11.200
perception or perception, because I don't, just the state I entered, and the next thing

58:11.200 --> 58:15.840
I know, it was five o'clock in the morning, it's like, yeah, we heard you're neither perception

58:15.840 --> 58:22.400
or perception snoring, or like, oh yeah, well, I go into this state when I don't hear

58:22.400 --> 58:29.840
or see anything, or whatever, that's a good meditation, not according to the sutras,

58:29.840 --> 58:34.000
I mean there are neither perception or perception of genuine kind, cessation of perception

58:34.000 --> 58:37.680
and feeling, but in order to get there, your mindfulness has to be utterly, completely

58:37.680 --> 58:38.680
unshakable.

58:38.680 --> 58:46.680
A lot of people refer to this mind to, you know, this is a feeling of experience, isn't

58:46.680 --> 58:47.680
it?

58:47.680 --> 58:51.320
Well, yeah, like, you know, I kind of, in the beginning, I was given a benefit of doubt,

58:51.320 --> 58:56.520
and then the more they talk about it, you realize, you were just asleep, mate, or you

58:56.520 --> 59:01.640
know, when you go in a state, when you can't fall asleep, because you're not lying down,

59:01.640 --> 59:07.720
but you're kind of half out, lots of people end up in that state, because they're seated

59:07.720 --> 59:11.680
on the floor, so you can't quite fall asleep, that's why I lie down, that's why I lie

59:11.680 --> 59:18.000
on, which again, that that that that genre is confirmed by kind of external eye of nodding,

59:18.000 --> 59:22.400
you can see them nodding left and right, bobbing and weaving sort of, oh yeah, I have a good

59:22.400 --> 59:30.160
meditation, yeah, we saw that.

59:30.160 --> 59:38.000
So again, it's the lack of a person being authentic, they lie to themselves, and yeah,

59:38.000 --> 59:43.720
you know, quite a few people like that that are met, were very sensitive about a topic of

59:43.720 --> 59:48.480
meditation, they would be implied, they're maybe not meditating rightly, or if somebody else

59:48.480 --> 59:52.280
would be implying indirectly that what they're doing is not right, they give a upset,

59:52.280 --> 59:58.200
you know, well, what's the point of your meditation, if you hold on to it so dearly and personally,

59:58.200 --> 01:00:07.240
you're getting upset, if somebody criticizes it, and surely you're not doing it right,

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:14.840
if someone else's random video can shake you up so much, you can offend you, you should

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:30.360
be grateful anyway, exactly, like there you go, I just laid it out for you, that's why,

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:39.200
if I read this Roman philosopher's Greek philosopher, they sought out challenges, you know, yes.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.640
You sought out a challenge of your view, not the challenge to prove your seal is good

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.520
or something like that, which some of those people do, you want to challenge your views,

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.520
absolutely.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:54.880
So someone says, oh, I tell you your view, that's the attitude you can be sure about, they

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:03.160
can't lead you to wrong, is attitude of challenging every view, no matter how dear to you it is,

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.240
and that's it, the views are dear to you, but they said, oh, surely you're holding to

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:14.560
the view because it pleases you, it's dear to you, you know, when that man said to the

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.400
Buddha, I don't hold to any views, no views are pleasing to me, and he said, well, surely

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:30.600
that view is pleasing to you, and he said, oh, okay, yeah, you have a point there, but

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:37.000
when you have a view, that no view will be dear to you, including that view, in a sense,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.640
that whatever view you have, you recognize you always have to have a view, you can't

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.680
have a state of no view, because that's a view, which means if you believe it's not the

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.560
view you're contradicting yourself, thus you're even more wrong, so it's not about not having

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:56.680
any views, which is impossible, it's about finding the right view, and then going beyond

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:02.360
even the right view, which is possible, which is our answer, but in order to get the right

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.920
view, you must not hold to any view for the sake of pleasing you, oh, this view is pleasing

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:14.640
to me, you can't help having a view being pleasing to you, but where you can't help is

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:23.800
not leaving it unturned, not taking for granted, not leaving it unquestioned, so you get a view,

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.760
then you find the views that are opposing to the view, and if you think, oh, this is a

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:35.120
wrong view, well, you need to fully understand why, how, and where that view is wrong, not

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.560
just decide this is wrong because somebody else said, even the Buddha, or the Buddha said

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:45.400
that, well, sure, but do you understand it for yourself? Do you understand why wrong views

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:51.520
are wrong, if you do, you have the right view? Yes, it's dangerous, so I think it's probably

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:58.640
useful if someone, you know, someone who can challenge you, you know, if you don't have

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:05.640
any good challenging, then open any book, because you're bound to think, oh, these views

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.440
are wrong, well, open those books, read them, and try to see for yourself why, how, and

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.760
where those views are wrong, not just assume they're wrong, and same, oh, the Buddha's

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:22.120
right, okay, open the suitors and understand where, how, and why, it's right, and if you're

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:28.760
doing it correctly, you'll see, you'll be fearful, you'll be like anxious, to read other

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:34.240
stuff that you think it's wrong because you might not see, it is wrong, thus, you're

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.040
not as right as you think you are, but that's inevitable, you have to go through that.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:47.040
Yeah, it feels like the thing that you think is wrong, because if there is anything right,

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:54.960
it's that which cannot be taken personally, and it will stay, it will stay on, you won't

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.880
drop off. Yeah, it can't be, no one can challenge it, yeah, no one can take it, you can't

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:09.760
challenge it, you've been challenging it, you've been like, like attacking it without, and

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:15.480
whatever was susceptible to doubt, was affected by it, except those things that were beyond

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:24.080
doubt, so you go beyond doubt by basically reaching a point where the doubt cannot enter,

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:29.400
not because you were shying away from doubting it, but because you were doubting full on,

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:35.560
you fully became doubt, and then you recognize that their points, the doubt cannot enter,

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:42.360
and that's doubt free, it's beyond doubt, beyond doubt means inaccessible to doubt, doesn't

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:49.600
mean, oh, I never doubt this because, yeah, I fear, I fear that if I doubt, I might change

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:56.680
my mind, re-evaluate everything, and 30 years that I invest in this, down the drain, yeah,

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:04.600
from the day one, full on doubt, very unpleasant, but, you know, relatively quick way of progressing

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:14.080
if you do it right, because you know, oh, this is beyond doubt, not because I'm not doubting

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:27.040
it, because it's nature, it's impenetrable to doubt.
