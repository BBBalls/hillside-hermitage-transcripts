00:00.000 --> 00:11.840
So, as one of you could say, a little bit about social compassionate, engaged acts as

00:11.840 --> 00:23.600
a path to freedom, you know, to engage bullism as a very big thing nowadays, and that as

00:23.600 --> 00:26.320
a path to freedom from suffering.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.680
Like, path got a hundred?

00:28.680 --> 00:44.240
I mean, I guess depending on how you define engaged, to one extent, depending how you

00:44.240 --> 00:53.000
define engaged, but what you said social engaged means like engaged with society, the social

00:53.000 --> 00:56.840
work and stuff like that, no, it's impossible.

00:56.840 --> 01:02.760
Basically, the maximum amount of engagement is what the Buddha prescribed for the monks,

01:02.760 --> 01:06.840
in the part and giving the teachings to those who want to hear it.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.840
That's about it.

01:07.840 --> 01:12.840
Even that, it's kind of on the margin.

01:12.840 --> 01:18.280
So, yes, first, there's four laypeople engaging socially compassionate.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.840
Well, that's fine, but they cannot expect the results of our relationship, but as a

01:22.840 --> 01:25.360
monk, devoting your time.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.520
Well, it's a contradiction in terms that you'd be better off as a layperson devoting

01:29.520 --> 01:34.880
a time to that, because there's a monk wearing the robe, keeping the vineyard, it's like

01:34.880 --> 01:38.880
your statement that you're practicing towards the arrangement of supposedly.

01:38.880 --> 01:45.080
So, if you dress as a monk, I mean, you are a monk, you keep the vineyard, but you act

01:45.080 --> 01:50.480
like a layperson and social engaged, it's nice in lay terms and secular terms, and it's

01:50.480 --> 01:54.160
very worldly, but there's nothing to do with practice of done, quite the opposite.

01:54.160 --> 01:59.920
I mean, the Buddha was criticizing the monks who were quite detained at the time, like

01:59.920 --> 02:05.000
Ananda and other teras, when they were sobbing the robes in that sutra, and they were just

02:05.000 --> 02:09.160
talking around, like, you know, they had katina and sobbing the robes, and the Buddha came

02:09.160 --> 02:11.520
in and was like, what was going on here?

02:11.520 --> 02:15.120
When they said, oh, it's just Lord, you know, it's the katina with sobbing robes, like,

02:15.120 --> 02:20.000
well, I thought he was like a band of fishermen, like shouting, like when they sell fish,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.760
there's this ridiculous noise, and then he rebuked them all, and Ananda especially, you

02:24.760 --> 02:28.800
should not be socializing in that manner, and those like monks with monks, for the, you

02:28.800 --> 02:33.600
know, the great purpose of the katina, which is usually regarded as this great gathering,

02:33.600 --> 02:40.040
yeah, the Buddha is just completely cutting down, because they were just, yeah, socializing

02:40.040 --> 02:49.840
for no dharma purpose, basically, and you could see how much more that would be the truth

02:49.840 --> 02:56.080
in case of, like, socializing for something completely secular.

02:56.080 --> 03:03.120
It's nice, charity is nice, but it's no more than a good deed, so if a person is practicing

03:03.120 --> 03:09.960
for art andmanship, he cannot afford, basically, to spend his time doing charity, unless he

03:09.960 --> 03:16.720
can do charity completely in an undistracting manner or something, but it's highly unlikely,

03:16.720 --> 03:21.360
and the best the person can really do is free themselves, that's how you contribute

03:21.360 --> 03:27.760
to the well-being of the entire humanity, one being, one five aggregates less that is

03:27.760 --> 03:34.480
trapped by samsara, there is no greater contribution to the big perspective of samsara, you can

03:34.480 --> 03:38.760
be building hospitals and schools and everything else, and they will last, you know, maybe for

03:38.760 --> 03:43.760
hundreds of years, but that's about it, but if a person frees themselves, they contribute

03:43.760 --> 03:52.600
it to basically one entire being that's been tied for eons and eons and eons, they would

03:52.600 --> 03:57.520
be freed from samsara never to return, there is no greater contribution towards the world

03:57.520 --> 04:06.320
than that freedom of one by one, like, every person can help one being, let one being

04:06.320 --> 04:11.440
be themselves, exactly, oh, well, that secondary, whether that being is yourself or not, but

04:11.440 --> 04:17.720
yes, if you have to be yourself, exactly, you cannot do enlightenment for somebody else,

04:17.720 --> 04:21.880
but when it comes to enlightenment, it ceases to be, when yourself, you remove the ownership,

04:21.880 --> 04:26.320
which is why you become enlightened, that's the whole point, but from the ultimate point

04:26.320 --> 04:31.200
of view of the, like, samsara and being strapped in it, that is the greatest contribution,

04:31.200 --> 04:35.120
obviously, a person who cannot, people who cannot see beyond their sense of self and self

04:35.120 --> 04:39.480
centeredness, they'll think, oh, that's your selfish, they're just doing that, but everything

04:39.480 --> 04:43.720
you do, everything you have a desire to do, it's selfish, because you're just fulfilling

04:43.720 --> 04:47.680
your desire, even if it's to help the others, so that's not optional, so you just want

04:47.680 --> 04:55.120
to basically see how limited your goals will be or how expanded, you know, dedicating

04:55.120 --> 04:59.800
your life to something that will make a difference in the world is very limited from the ultimate

04:59.800 --> 05:03.880
point of view, it's certainly better than not doing anything at all, neither practicing

05:03.880 --> 05:08.600
for enlightenment nor being generous and doing charity, but the problem is when people

05:08.600 --> 05:13.800
start to charity thinking that's what leads to enlightenment, well, that's not true,

05:13.800 --> 05:17.680
so if you can do a charity that won't impede your way towards enlightenment, that's absolutely

05:17.680 --> 05:22.360
fine, but as I say, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to do that, or you might have

05:22.360 --> 05:29.200
to limit your activities towards charity and helping others, because they should not

05:29.200 --> 05:34.440
be the priority of somebody, we supposedly dedicated their life towards the practice of

05:34.440 --> 05:41.440
enlightenment, I, about this month.
