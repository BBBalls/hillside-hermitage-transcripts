00:00.000 --> 00:22.360
So it's generally referring to like the senses, but also then kind of what the senses disclose.

00:22.360 --> 00:28.840
Like I was thinking about like how I disclose, for example like space and distance and stuff

00:28.840 --> 00:32.160
through to the senses and trying to figure that out.

00:32.160 --> 00:39.880
So I'll just read to you what I wrote and you can stop me any time, so I wrote the

00:39.880 --> 00:47.800
senses can be discerned as a point of view or an orientation regarding things.

00:47.800 --> 00:55.400
The working sense base allows for the disclosure of a respected field for a respected world

00:55.400 --> 01:03.280
of visual objects of sounds etc. It must absolutely be this point of view for there to be experience

01:03.280 --> 01:12.120
to have no point of view or every point of view is inconceivable and completely abstract.

01:12.120 --> 01:20.160
Furthermore the position of this point of view corresponds with the location of that respective

01:20.160 --> 01:27.240
matter as disclosed through other senses. The one must be sure to remember that this is

01:27.240 --> 01:34.180
not the matter itself. I can touch my eyeball, but that is a perception of touch, not the

01:34.180 --> 01:37.720
eye which is that by which there is vision.

01:37.720 --> 01:44.200
Hence the senses are negative phenomena, they do not appear, but the fact that there

01:44.200 --> 01:51.260
is a presentation within limits allows for their discernment, the senses then also

01:51.260 --> 02:00.600
disclose space such as in the form of distance, area and so on. Thus I can designate a near

02:00.600 --> 02:11.000
or far or a hear or yonder and so on. This here by appropriating the senses, it comes

02:11.000 --> 02:19.040
me in terms of a spatial positioning. I am here, things are there. I am internal, everything

02:19.040 --> 02:25.800
else is external. With the cessation of that appropriation, things still stand in the

02:25.800 --> 02:35.160
world, but now simply seen as a conscious space body and name and form externally.

02:35.160 --> 02:47.420
I was going to say, when you started, I was about to say, you have to point out that

02:47.420 --> 02:51.760
senses do not appear, but then you pointed it out.

02:51.760 --> 02:59.520
I just was on a tangent at one point where it is kind of like, how do I know that the

02:59.520 --> 03:06.520
sense there is, they do not appear, and that is because there are things, that is how

03:06.520 --> 03:07.520
you can infer.

03:07.520 --> 03:15.520
Yes, you can know. I was just kind of working on that word as point of view, instead of

03:15.520 --> 03:18.520
using the designation senses.

03:18.520 --> 03:24.520
It is a point of view because it is already, anything that is directed, which I think

03:24.520 --> 03:28.520
is conscious, it is already directed. There is consciousness, there is a direction, which

03:28.520 --> 03:34.520
is there is a point of view, and senses in themselves, they have their own direction of

03:34.520 --> 03:37.520
senses towards sense objects.

03:37.520 --> 03:45.520
Absolutely, that is what point of view is.

03:45.520 --> 03:51.520
One other thing I was also thinking about is, in terms of mind, I was trying to sort out

03:51.520 --> 03:58.520
my ideas on what mind as mono, first mind as chitta.

03:58.520 --> 04:06.520
I understand in some basic sense that mono is like, let's say, that by which I can imagine

04:06.520 --> 04:14.520
things, imaginary objects, realistic objects.

04:14.520 --> 04:21.520
So in that kind of sense, though, is there some overlap between that and, let's say,

04:21.520 --> 04:24.520
a thought of a feeling, let's say.

04:24.520 --> 04:30.520
Is that something that appears in the senses that I want to describe that, or is it different?

04:30.520 --> 04:34.520
Would you mean thought of a feeling?

04:34.520 --> 04:41.520
Like, I think such a feeling is present as a thought.

04:41.520 --> 04:48.520
And as one could describe it, it has like a mind object with the mind sense base.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.520
Yeah, sure.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.520
So then the chitta refers to something different.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.520
Yes.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.520
And what's that?

04:58.520 --> 05:03.520
Well, chitta refers to the actual feeling with big felt, and perception that is being

05:03.520 --> 05:12.520
perceived, the peripheral of that, people of chitta is.

05:12.520 --> 05:20.520
So simultaneous presence of Sangha and Vedina.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.520
That's what chitta is in regard to that.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.520
That's the first role that he said.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.520
Well, yeah.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.520
You can say another.

05:30.520 --> 05:38.520
That's the previous presence with the presence of Sangha and Chalva and Vedina.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.520
The simultaneous, to the same extent.

05:41.520 --> 05:48.520
So to the extent of feeling being felt, perception being perceived, the mind is there.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.520
So in terms of the mind as a sense.

05:50.520 --> 05:58.520
So it's not actually inaccurate to translate it as heart, as I really mentioned once,

05:58.520 --> 06:01.520
because it involves feelings, obviously.

06:01.520 --> 06:07.520
That chitta is inconceivable without feelings being felt, perceptions perceived.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.520
So it's the mind on that level.

06:10.520 --> 06:17.520
By the way, you want to say heart, because it brings notion of self-indulgence.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.520
Oh, kind of.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.520
Yeah.

06:20.520 --> 06:30.520
So it's certainly, it's certainly, well, you can say it's, well,

06:30.520 --> 06:32.520
it's a completely different phenomenon.

06:32.520 --> 06:40.520
But it's also, as such, it is quite a, quite a more of a, of a, of a negative.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.520
More general than man with itself would be.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.520
The actual thinking in terms of the mind objects.

06:49.520 --> 06:54.520
So when it comes to chitta, it's, it's more passive in that regard.

06:54.520 --> 06:58.520
In comparison to the mind.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.520
So you can't.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.520
That's why, that's why the moods, the states of mind,

07:03.520 --> 07:10.520
a late in mind, depressed mind, mind with joy, a cornerless mind,

07:10.520 --> 07:13.520
kind of very, very general states.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.520
You discern as something that has a reason.

07:17.520 --> 07:22.520
And you just find it as, as such.

07:22.520 --> 07:26.520
Which means those, those moves are of, of a very general nature.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.520
And, and basically.

07:30.520 --> 07:31.520
Yeah.

07:31.520 --> 07:36.520
You can't be actively, so to speak, involved on that level.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.520
In as much as you could with, with actually choosing what you want to think.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
Yeah.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.520
In terms of the mind objects.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.520
And that's probably important to distinguish, because people are mind, mind.

07:46.520 --> 07:52.520
And then when the moods are present or some, quite, quite general kind of feelings

07:52.520 --> 07:54.520
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and big used perceptions.

07:54.520 --> 07:58.520
They know, we got back in the same sense as, as people regarded.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
So which is why, actually.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.520
Often people dismiss it as well.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.520
We have said, let's just accept thought.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.520
Cause they can't, they can't conceive it in any other way.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.520
So that they played all in front of them.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.520
Yes.

08:12.520 --> 08:20.600
But so Chita is more of something that's being felt, and obviously some of them use the

08:20.600 --> 08:26.940
perceived at that general level, in some biguse notion, like a notion of expansion, a notion

08:26.940 --> 08:36.560
of trunk, a notion of light, a notion of heavy, those are the perceptions in regard to Chita.

08:36.560 --> 08:46.560
And then you can say that we use a term accessible, inaccessible, in terms of root, but especially.

08:46.560 --> 08:53.560
Could we say something similar with Chita, like that, whenever there's a mood of the mind,

08:53.560 --> 08:57.560
they say, you can say basically the same in regard to the whole five aggregates.

08:57.560 --> 09:01.560
They're really inaccessible to it, in their nature.

09:01.560 --> 09:08.560
Now know either, you access it. You develop up around it in regard to it, and you assume that.

09:08.560 --> 09:13.560
So I think I'm in a bad mood, but that thought is not the mood itself.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.560
Exactly, exactly.

09:14.560 --> 09:19.560
But because you don't know what the mood itself is, that's thought, which is actually not,

09:19.560 --> 09:23.560
the mood itself, is the only thing that stands for that mood for you in that experience.

09:23.560 --> 09:34.560
You assume that, and it is.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.560
Because I was thinking too about, like, in terms of sense basis.

09:38.560 --> 09:54.560
There's a, this seems to me in some sense, out of what this, some, like, sort of say, different view required,

09:54.560 --> 09:59.560
like, for the mind as opposed to, like, the eye.

09:59.560 --> 10:03.560
Because, like, it was back to the distance, for example.

10:03.560 --> 10:09.560
We can't, doesn't make really distance in my mind, except in reference to the other sense basis.

10:09.560 --> 10:14.560
But, like, in terms of just a thought, there's no distance, so to say.

10:14.560 --> 10:21.560
Well, yeah, I mean, there is no, so much of a defined distance, but the distance is very much there.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.560
The space is very much there.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.560
It's actually primarily spaces metal.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.560
That's what the space is.

10:30.560 --> 10:35.560
What the intentions are with the movement is, the notion of movement, even if nothing moves.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.560
The possibility of movement.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.560
So they'll ask at least in a space.

10:41.560 --> 10:45.560
No, that's how space is being generated, so to speak.

10:45.560 --> 10:52.560
So, that's how, because of that, you can see it in things, around it.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.560
So, it is, that's why space can be used.

10:56.560 --> 11:02.560
So, it's often described as one of, like, after the four great elements, then the element of space, the element of consciousness.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.560
Or, it's not a fundamental one.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
It almost is.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.560
I mean, it's only in person, or, obviously.

11:08.560 --> 11:13.560
And they have that base of infinite space.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.560
So, I found that, or curious.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.560
Well, it is, it is.

11:18.560 --> 11:25.560
And, obviously, it's, you know, there is plenty of things to be contemplated on.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.560
In regard to that.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.560
In terms of, to develop your mind.

11:28.560 --> 11:33.560
Because, if you do develop a notion of space, I'm even being spaced out.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.560
Spaced for that.

11:34.560 --> 11:41.560
I mean, like, generally, understanding that the phenomenon of space, as a negative in regard to the phenomena that appear.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.560
But it's, it's real as such.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.560
It is real as a negative phenomenon.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.560
What do you mean by it as a negative?

11:48.560 --> 11:55.560
Well, the space without the object is in concealment, without the object, sir, that is, it is in concealment.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.560
So, there is no such thing as a pure space.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.560
Even the infinite space.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.560
It's the infinite negative.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.560
So, you step into it, negative, though.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.560
You don't take it up as an object, which is important.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.560
You can't look at it that way.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.560
Exactly.

12:12.560 --> 12:20.560
So, it is more simple level than, let's say, space disclosed through my eye.

12:20.560 --> 12:28.560
You're saying, basically, that all that appears is, of course, vision and objects of vision.

12:28.560 --> 12:40.560
And within that field, it's almost like you're saying, basically, space is only disclosed by objects.

12:40.560 --> 12:48.560
Well, space is disclosed by mind in regard to objects.

12:48.560 --> 12:55.560
So, the eye and the objects, there wouldn't be any space, discerned.

12:55.560 --> 13:00.560
But then, obviously, there wouldn't be any scene, discerned if there is no mind present.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.560
So, it's that presence of the mind.

13:02.560 --> 13:09.560
That's what space is.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.560
Yeah, I'm having trouble seeing that.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.560
I can understand that, no mind or vision.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.560
No, you don't have to see it elsewhere.

13:18.560 --> 13:25.560
Basically, what you think now, that the space is, that's being discerned through your eye and the vision,

13:25.560 --> 13:29.560
stay with that same space, just putting the place of mind.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.560
Don't attribute it to the eye.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.560
But it's the same thing that you've seen.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.560
You're just assuming it at the wrong place.

13:39.560 --> 13:45.560
So, the eye can only see, but the mind is not disclosed here, the under and the between.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.560
Well, yes, but see, even the eye can only see, would make any sense.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.560
You couldn't even think that if you can't think it.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.560
But if it's not being thought.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.560
So, the senses, regardless of the mind, are inconceivable.

13:58.560 --> 14:05.560
They don't operate.

14:05.560 --> 14:11.560
So, that's, you know, you won't find the space, it's clearly defined phenomena in your mind.

14:11.560 --> 14:17.560
But what I'm explaining now might be enough, basically, to just sort of bring it back,

14:17.560 --> 14:24.560
just a couple of millimeters back, so to speak, which is enough to stop assuming

14:24.560 --> 14:31.560
and rooting that space into the actual eye and forms,

14:31.560 --> 14:36.560
means basically misconceiving it.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.560
So, in that sense, that's why the mind comes first.

14:49.560 --> 15:00.560
Although the whole notion of space, for example, is negative in regard to things that appear.

15:00.560 --> 15:05.560
Structurally, it precedes things that appear.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.560
Space, their mind.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.560
Either way, let's, we're talking about space.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.560
So, let's say space.

15:12.560 --> 15:17.560
So, if you then discern that, that, okay, so space can't stand on its own.

15:17.560 --> 15:22.560
You know that. So, you're not misconceiving it as a separate mystical universal entity

15:22.560 --> 15:26.560
of some of some great providence of the divine nature or whatever else.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.560
So, you know what it is.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.560
You discern it as an eighth phenomena.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.560
But, you know that it comes structurally.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.560
So, simultaneously present with the things that have been seen,

15:36.560 --> 15:42.560
her touch, taste, smell, taste and thought of.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.560
So, the space is simultaneously present with those things.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.560
But, it structurally precedes them.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.560
It's more fundamental.

15:51.560 --> 15:56.560
Which is how people under-pursuming that space and time are universal entities.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.560
That we inhabit in.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.560
We are in them.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.560
But, obviously, there is overshooting the mark.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.560
That's when you give it complete independence.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.560
But, it's not independent.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.560
It would not be discernible.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.560
The space, if there are no things that occupy space.

16:12.560 --> 16:17.560
But, there is a truth in it in a sense that it is more primordial structurally.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.560
So, not before, not after.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.560
Simultaneous to present.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.560
And, in that sense, it precedes.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.560
It comes first.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.560
And then everything else comes second.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.560
So, if your mind is discerned directly,

16:28.560 --> 16:31.560
and establishes itself upon the phenomenon of space,

16:31.560 --> 16:35.560
then you can see basically how it will be withdrawn.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.560
The mind from everything else that occupies that space.

16:38.560 --> 16:43.560
With your established mind on that.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.560
Exactly.

16:44.560 --> 16:53.560
And such general negative phenomenon of space is infinite.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.560
It's not kept to it.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.560
You can put it on the system today.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.560
And the mind gets established upon that.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.560
And if it is established upon that,

17:01.560 --> 17:05.560
it can't possibly be exercised for it to attain any last version of the illusion

17:05.560 --> 17:08.560
in regard to anything that occupies that space.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.560
Now, is that seen as circumstantially risen?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.560
That infinity of space.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.560
That's, I'm going to go on a limb and say,

17:15.560 --> 17:18.560
that's not referring to, like, oh, the universe is infinitely...

17:18.560 --> 17:19.560
Oh, absolutely not.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.560
No, no, no.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.560
That's the projected concealed space in time.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.560
The protrusion of space in time.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.560
They look scientific.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.560
Exactly.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.560
Scientific space in time.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.560
No, no, no, no.

17:31.560 --> 17:34.560
The infinity of space is the infinity of the mind.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.560
The infinity of the attention is the infinity of the structure

17:37.560 --> 17:40.560
of the five aggregates.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.560
So what are we saying when we're saying space?

17:43.560 --> 17:45.560
Then what are we saying?

17:45.560 --> 17:48.560
Like, what is space referring to, I guess, one of the space?

17:48.560 --> 17:49.560
Space.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.560
Yeah.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.560
Like...

17:52.560 --> 17:55.560
There is space between you and me, space.

17:55.560 --> 17:58.560
Yeah, you can, you can, you can, particularly, you can say that there is also space.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.560
And she is the same nature as the general, you know,

18:01.560 --> 18:04.560
base of infinity, infinite space.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.560
I have to think about that some more.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.560
Yeah.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.560
You have to, basically, the mind is trained in regard to it,

18:16.560 --> 18:19.560
because you don't want to make it into an object.

18:19.560 --> 18:23.560
Like, you, me, two positives.

18:23.560 --> 18:27.560
And a different angle of the spectrum from this point of view.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.560
And then, oh, where is the space now?

18:29.560 --> 18:33.560
And then you try to grasp the space in the same positive terms.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.560
Try to disclose it in the same manner.

18:35.560 --> 18:36.560
You want that...

18:36.560 --> 18:39.560
Well, you'll disclose something, but that won't be the space.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.560
So if you think that is that what space is,

18:41.560 --> 18:43.560
then you'll be serious when it's consuming it.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.560
Or not finding it.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.560
So it has to be seen the same level as mind, so to say.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.560
Yes.

18:51.560 --> 18:57.560
Has to be seen as a peripheral phenomena that structurally comes first.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.560
Not temporarily.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.560
What is meant when something structurally comes first?

19:05.560 --> 19:07.560
It means it's simultaneously present.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.560
But it's not second.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.560
It's first.

19:15.560 --> 19:20.560
And you're saying you can have ideas of non-temporal with at first and second.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.560
Yeah.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.560
First and second.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.560
Well, you can have this and this.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.560
But one of the best is the first best.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.560
The other one is the second best.

19:30.560 --> 19:35.560
As if one is more fundamental than the other one.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.560
Well, it's fundamental.

19:37.560 --> 19:43.560
Fundamental means basically it precedes the other one in that order.

19:43.560 --> 19:48.560
So imagine you have a line of people in front of you.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.560
Or just two people in front of you.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.560
They're in the same line.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.560
They don't let the right not before or after.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.560
They're right there at the same time.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.560
But one of them is closer.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.560
The other one isn't.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.560
Close.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
Yeah.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.560
Can you explain that?

20:05.560 --> 20:07.560
It's a vertical point.

20:07.560 --> 20:10.560
Not the linear.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.560
Like you said in the preface.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.560
Yes.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.560
Okay.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.560
I think you're the virus in there.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.560
Yeah.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.560
Yeah.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.560
That's better in there.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
Yeah.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.560
So simultaneous presence of the two things.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.560
Why is it close to the other one?

20:23.560 --> 20:26.560
But they're both simultaneously present.

20:26.560 --> 20:33.560
Is that similar to like thinking of things as more external, less external?

20:33.560 --> 20:35.560
Or is that a different kind of route?

20:35.560 --> 20:37.560
Well, it's a different route.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.560
It will be a different route.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.560
Yeah.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.560
How do we do the right with the same simultaneous principle?

20:42.560 --> 20:43.560
But it's over there.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.560
But yeah, I wouldn't try to.

20:45.560 --> 20:49.560
But yeah, I wouldn't try to.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.560
I realized after I said it, I know.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.560
Yeah.

20:53.560 --> 20:59.560
It's a different route.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.560
And the first thing is the mind.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.560
It's always the first, most first, first.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.560
Yes.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.560
Yeah.

21:09.560 --> 21:14.560
Is it something like a place which has no good cavity?

21:14.560 --> 21:17.560
It's the things.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.560
Place.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.560
If it wasn't, there wasn't a place for it.

21:21.560 --> 21:24.560
So it could be placed.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.560
It's a place, but you can't.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.560
Space.

21:28.560 --> 21:29.560
Yeah.

21:29.560 --> 21:36.560
Space is that it's a kind of place which it places.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.560
It's like a place.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.560
Yeah.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.560
You can say that.

21:41.560 --> 21:45.560
I know what you're doing, but the thing is, when you say place,

21:45.560 --> 21:47.560
you put imagine an actual setup.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
Yeah.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
Yeah.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
Yeah.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.560
It's like a non-located unit.

21:53.560 --> 21:57.560
Well, that's the thing, because the structure,

21:57.560 --> 22:01.560
the space is infinite, so to speak.

22:01.560 --> 22:05.560
That means that's why things are possible to arise on a particular level

22:05.560 --> 22:08.560
on the basis of that space.

22:08.560 --> 22:13.560
So the mind, mind, is off space and off time,

22:13.560 --> 22:15.560
not in space and in time.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.560
It's made of it.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.560
That's where the mind is.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.560
So that's why you want to think about that because in that,

22:21.560 --> 22:23.560
when you think about mind,

22:23.560 --> 22:25.560
well, you won't make it mind.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.560
You'll see it as part of the space.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.560
And when you think about the space, scientific space,

22:30.560 --> 22:32.560
you won't make it into scientific space because you know

22:32.560 --> 22:36.560
well, it wouldn't be there because that's where the mind is.

22:36.560 --> 22:40.560
But if you divorce it, then yes, you get the scientific space

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
that we want to have it and you get this mind,

22:42.560 --> 22:45.560
inside of this brain, then nobody,

22:45.560 --> 22:48.560
the only mean knows and sees.

22:48.560 --> 22:53.560
But space is off mind and off time,

22:53.560 --> 22:56.560
not in space and in time.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.560
It brings to mind, like if you,

23:04.560 --> 23:07.560
you know, you get a lot of people trying to organize

23:07.560 --> 23:08.560
their thoughts in it.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.560
It almost feels like they're organizing things in space,

23:11.560 --> 23:13.560
like mental space.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.560
A very mundane example, but it's trying to start with.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.560
Well, yeah.

23:19.560 --> 23:23.560
If the mind is off space,

23:23.560 --> 23:26.560
you can possibly be entering this external public

23:26.560 --> 23:28.560
assumed space over the science.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.560
It's going to work without me.

23:31.560 --> 23:35.560
I would also contribute to me starting to think in this way

23:35.560 --> 23:40.560
was I was observing a particular thought, let's say.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.560
And it's so easy to assume,

23:42.560 --> 23:46.560
oh, my thoughts are happening here somewhere.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.560
And that's where I got thing, oh,

23:48.560 --> 23:51.560
just not why assume that.

23:51.560 --> 23:55.560
And that's how the mind can expand itself

23:55.560 --> 23:57.560
in terms of the development,

23:57.560 --> 24:00.560
in terms of getting established upon different bases.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.560
When you stop assuming it right here,

24:03.560 --> 24:05.560
in this head or whatever,

24:05.560 --> 24:06.560
whatever kind of assuming,

24:06.560 --> 24:08.560
because that's completely materialist.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.560
So then you're actually, you know,

24:10.560 --> 24:13.560
my thought cannot really be placed in this head.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.560
So that's already quite a transcendental dimension,

24:16.560 --> 24:18.560
that you will never aware of,

24:18.560 --> 24:19.560
yet it's a simple thought.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.560
Any thought?

24:21.560 --> 24:23.560
Oh, so the thought arises,

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
it is real as phenomena,

24:24.560 --> 24:26.560
it endures,

24:26.560 --> 24:29.560
it persists while it's changing,

24:29.560 --> 24:31.560
yet you can put it in that space

24:31.560 --> 24:33.560
that you regard as space,

24:33.560 --> 24:36.560
usually in a common sense reading.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.560
Exactly.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.560
Same with the nature of perception.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.560
Same with any of the aggregates.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.560
Because aggregates are not in space,

24:44.560 --> 24:48.560
they're of space.

24:48.560 --> 24:53.560
For other, the space is basically generated

24:53.560 --> 24:55.560
by the positioning of the five aggregates

24:55.560 --> 24:58.560
of the simultaneously present matter,

24:58.560 --> 25:04.560
feeling, perception, intentions, and consciousness.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.560
You've got a pinpoint, I'll say.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.560
No, no, no, no, of course not.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.560
It's because there it is, isn't it?

25:11.560 --> 25:12.560
Yes, yes.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.560
Because it perceives that destination

25:14.560 --> 25:16.560
of its there is here.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.560
Because the five aggregates

25:18.560 --> 25:20.560
are present, it's not one,

25:20.560 --> 25:21.560
point of view.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.560
It's five, point of view.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.560
It's five, point of view.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.560
It's five, the main five heaps.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.560
That's where they're called heaps.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.560
Can't they just pact?

25:33.560 --> 25:35.560
I mean, they're pact over each other.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.560
So to speak, but not like they don't mix,

25:38.560 --> 25:40.560
they don't merge, they don't start,

25:40.560 --> 25:43.560
they don't connect, they move into one mass.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.560
They remain fully distinct

25:46.560 --> 25:53.560
and cannot possibly encroach into another domain.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.560
And that's already off space.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.560
But I think, actually,

25:57.560 --> 26:02.560
is our other space confusing.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.560
I kind of said in the space.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.560
But it's not in the space.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.560
It's giving the space the priority

26:09.560 --> 26:11.560
over the five aggregates.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.560
But it doesn't matter.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.560
That's why you can go past in three different spaces.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.560
It's not the ultimate development of the mind.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.560
It's perception and feeling.

26:20.560 --> 26:25.560
Conversation of it, that's the ultimate development of the mind.

26:25.560 --> 26:31.560
Which means space is secondary from that point of view.

26:31.560 --> 26:35.560
Simultaneous present.

26:35.560 --> 26:40.560
Just enough squares.

26:40.560 --> 26:53.560
That's what means off space.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.560
So the space that you're thinking of,

26:55.560 --> 26:59.560
that you're seeing in the established mindfulness

26:59.560 --> 27:02.560
of experiences are all.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.560
It's not, you know, there is a space.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.560
You don't have to find the right, the correct space.

27:07.560 --> 27:12.560
All you have to do is stop assuming it as being ultimately the first,

27:12.560 --> 27:16.560
in a sense that everything is inside of it.

27:16.560 --> 27:19.560
So just maintain the Simultaneous presence of that phenomena,

27:19.560 --> 27:23.560
but see it secondary.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.560
Like something's proceeding.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.560
Yeah, something's determining it.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.560
Which in the final gets.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.560
Which is experiencing it as a whole.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.560
Or resting on it together.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.560
The object's resting on it.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.560
I don't mean that.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.560
It's supported.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.560
It is caused by the equities.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.560
Well, yes, yes.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.560
Yes, yes.

27:47.560 --> 27:53.560
If that will establish this Simultaneous mindfulness

27:53.560 --> 27:55.560
of the two Simultaneous things.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.560
Then yeah, you can do that.

27:57.560 --> 28:01.560
But it's not.

28:01.560 --> 28:08.560
And the space is not the same protein as the phylogic aids.

28:08.560 --> 28:12.560
It's in regard to them, but not them.

28:12.560 --> 28:17.560
It's very much like up and on it.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.560
Yeah, we'll see if they feed or not.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.560
Well, the space.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.560
Yeah.

28:22.560 --> 28:27.560
Well, no, there's a thing.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.560
Because how can you, well, think of it as this.

28:30.560 --> 28:35.560
How can you have a notion of space if you're not thinking it?

28:35.560 --> 28:40.560
If it's not present as a no matter how ambiguous thought is still a thought.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.560
Which means the mind does come first.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.560
It is of space.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.560
It's not in space.

28:47.560 --> 28:54.560
So you can't have the mind without the space.

28:54.560 --> 28:58.560
But mind is not in the space.

28:58.560 --> 29:05.560
Because even the ambiguous general mystical notion of just pure space,

29:05.560 --> 29:07.560
it's a notion.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.560
It's a thought.

29:08.560 --> 29:13.560
It's a reason they're not present.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.560
And that would not be the case.

29:15.560 --> 29:23.560
If that genuine space would precede your thought and your thought would be in the space.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.560
Well, that is actually inconceivable.

29:26.560 --> 29:31.560
You can't even think of why even that misconception, it's kind of contradictory.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.560
Because you can't even misconceive it even if you want to.

29:33.560 --> 29:40.560
That's why once you discern things, you can't undo the knowledge.

29:40.560 --> 29:44.560
Because it just becomes incomprehensible.

29:44.560 --> 29:48.560
So in this particular sense, that you have now a notion of things that are in space.

29:48.560 --> 29:55.560
But then that whole notion rests upon ignoring the fact that that space is also thought.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.560
So these thoughts are in the thought.

29:58.560 --> 30:05.560
Well, that's not then the space that I'm attributing it to.

30:05.560 --> 30:09.560
Which means thoughts are thoughts.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.560
So then thoughts of space are thoughts of space.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.560
Can't be thoughts in space.

30:15.560 --> 30:21.560
Because there will be another thought.

30:21.560 --> 30:26.560
So it's inaccessible.

30:26.560 --> 30:35.560
Basically, saying that it's inaccessible means ceasing the assumption of it.

30:35.560 --> 30:41.560
Because when you know when it becomes inaccessible, means you cannot access it through ignorance.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.560
It's basically cannot be assumed.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.560
Means it's known.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.560
You cannot assume something when you know it.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.560
And that's an involuntary, that's not an optional thing.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.560
There can be worldly assumption that you might have.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.560
Oh, I assume such places, such and such.

30:57.560 --> 31:02.560
And then you find out you've got there and you see for yourself what it is.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.560
And even if your assumption was right, that assumption is gone now.

31:06.560 --> 31:12.560
Because now you actually experienced it and seen it for yourself, understood it.

31:12.560 --> 31:19.560
So even if you think about your past assumption, you can't possibly revoke it.

31:19.560 --> 31:24.560
Because now the knowledge is tightly fitted in the space where there's no place for assumption to end it.

31:24.560 --> 31:32.560
Hence it becomes inaccessible to assumption.

31:32.560 --> 31:42.560
It's a bit of vision of space.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.560
I see space.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.560
Of space.

31:47.560 --> 31:58.560
Now that space, whatever I perceive it as as a thought, that's not the space.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.560
Well, no, there's no space you have.

32:01.560 --> 32:06.560
So it's either going to be, there's no real space as opposed to space you have.

32:06.560 --> 32:10.560
There's only concealed space or space free from consumers.

32:10.560 --> 32:15.560
So an assumed space or space known for what it is and not assumed.

32:15.560 --> 32:27.560
But now you're trying to have both there at the same time and compare them and see which one is right.

32:27.560 --> 32:42.560
So the vision of space, it's not technically of space, it's of things that negatively reveal what other show the space as there, as not things.

32:42.560 --> 32:54.560
So you kind of say that the difference is like instead of saying this is in space, rather one should say there are things that disclose the presence of space.

32:54.560 --> 33:04.560
Yes, and that disclosed space is more fundamental in regard to those particular things that disclose it.

33:04.560 --> 33:13.560
But on the point of view of the mind and the final aggregates, it isn't the ultimate fundamental.

33:13.560 --> 33:25.560
So as I said, if you use space in a way to practice contemplation in regard to particular things, that's fine because basically that space will stand for the mind.

33:25.560 --> 33:41.560
But you want to be careful not to develop views that you are somehow in this universal public space and give it, like, and make it an entity that it's independent of yourself.

33:41.560 --> 33:45.560
So if you want to do that, well then don't forget that the mind is a fundamental thing.

33:45.560 --> 34:11.560
So in other words, what I'm saying, you can take particular things and then practice contemplation in regard to development of the mind, discerning of the nature of the thoughts and the mind and the citta, because that already includes that space.

34:11.560 --> 34:18.560
Basically, all you want to do is develop, or rather descend the principle between the actual and the peripheral.

34:18.560 --> 34:22.560
So if that actual is the extensive object, peripheral will be space in regard to it.

34:22.560 --> 34:28.560
And that's fine, if you develop knowledge of the principle.

34:28.560 --> 34:33.560
But if you start looking at the peripheral space as the actual, well then mind will be peripheral in regard to it.

34:33.560 --> 34:37.560
The final aggregates will be peripheral in regard to it.

34:37.560 --> 34:41.560
So then you develop again, understanding of the same principle.

34:41.560 --> 34:54.560
But you don't want to be discerning peripheral space in regard to things and then just assuming the same space that shares the same in regard to the mind as well.

34:54.560 --> 34:58.560
Then you're not the relevant principle of the simultaneous present.

34:58.560 --> 35:05.560
You're not discerning it in regard to either.

35:05.560 --> 35:12.560
So space is always peripheral, it's always negative, unless we're thinking.

35:12.560 --> 35:17.560
Then it isn't.

35:17.560 --> 35:26.560
Then you can say something else is, which means what you're thinking of is then not is misconceived space.

35:26.560 --> 35:52.560
Because you think of space where the space cannot be found.

35:52.560 --> 35:59.560
That's why from the point of view of discerning the peripheral, it doesn't matter if you refer to the space or the mind to the peripheral.

35:59.560 --> 36:10.560
It doesn't matter how you refer to it, as long as it's seen as peripheral.

36:10.560 --> 36:21.560
So then when you have a thought of space, then when you may mind fully in regard to peripheral, it may matter a lot of the peripheral in regard to that thought of this space.

36:21.560 --> 36:24.560
And then soon enough you'll see that that's not the space.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.560
The space is always on the peripheral level.

36:27.560 --> 36:43.560
The space, your experiences of space, can be in the space.

36:43.560 --> 36:57.560
In the space would mean basically when you would feel it to give a complete independent, what complete independence to the notion of actual thought of space.

36:57.560 --> 37:06.560
And then attribute even the peripheral to it, say it's in the space.

37:06.560 --> 37:13.560
And that's a view, that's a wrong view, that's a wrong assumption.

37:13.560 --> 37:25.560
Like this thing, if I say something in space, it's assuming space was already kind of just there hanging out with it.

37:25.560 --> 37:40.560
So you can have a thought of the space in the space, but don't give it that full independence and don't attribute that which is peripheral in regard to that thought of this space.

37:40.560 --> 37:45.560
Don't attribute the peripheral to it.

37:45.560 --> 38:11.560
As in everything is in the space, because that's completing your choice with actual no basis for that assumption.

38:11.560 --> 38:22.560
And if you want to discern space in the right terms, you don't have to try to think it out because it's pointless.

38:22.560 --> 38:28.560
Just feel the feeling, perceive where there was being perceived simultaneously.

38:28.560 --> 38:39.560
Then experience will be the experience of space.

38:39.560 --> 38:49.560
And then experience even precedes the craving that you have now to fit the space in the right terms.

38:49.560 --> 38:54.560
And if you see the craving, then well it's fit in the right terms.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.560
Not pollutants.

38:57.560 --> 39:15.560
Hence the emotions of it you might have had then, before that of all space was this space is that it just becomes pointless.

39:15.560 --> 39:28.560
I think one has to work very hard to get out of the typical notions of space.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.560
Yeah, well that's the thing, that's what I'm pointing at.

39:30.560 --> 39:35.560
You don't have to get out by thinking your way out.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.560
You just have to get out by seeing it for what it is.

39:38.560 --> 39:46.560
So accepted, did you have notions of space? And then that's a present, there is an experience as a whole for what it is.

39:46.560 --> 39:52.560
And then in regard to that, feel the feelings, perceive those perceptions.

39:52.560 --> 40:02.560
Basically uprooted with mindfulness. Don't try to figure it out and explain it to yourself.

40:02.560 --> 40:12.560
So it needs to be understood and seen and discerned, but it doesn't mean explain it to yourself.

40:12.560 --> 40:18.560
So that's kind of why I wanted to understand something but not necessarily to put it into words.

40:18.560 --> 40:23.560
Well no, no, that means you did not quite understand it.

40:23.560 --> 40:28.560
Okay. That's why you qualify it just as I said it.

40:28.560 --> 40:35.560
Explaining it to yourself, sorry, explaining it to yourself is not, it's not the same as understanding it.

40:35.560 --> 40:40.560
Like explaining it is finding a plausible explanation from the point of view that you still have.

40:40.560 --> 40:44.560
That's why I explained it, it's plausible to me now.

40:44.560 --> 40:48.560
But the criteria of what's plausible are not, it's not fully developed obviously,

40:48.560 --> 40:53.560
because otherwise you wouldn't be resorting to the temporal explanations of things.

40:53.560 --> 40:58.560
What you're referring to is describing something once it has been understood.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.560
And that's definitely not an explanation, it's a description.

41:02.560 --> 41:07.560
Because why? Because throughout that description, the thing remains present because it's understood.

41:07.560 --> 41:11.560
In explanation, that's not the case. In explanation, you might arrive at it.

41:11.560 --> 41:16.560
Well, so you think you arrive at it when you explain it.

41:16.560 --> 41:22.560
But that means you didn't have it to begin with. That's how can you explain it if you don't have it to begin with.

41:22.560 --> 41:26.560
So really, you want to replace explanation with descriptions.

41:26.560 --> 41:32.560
Thermological descriptions. That's what suitors are. Just pure descriptions.

41:32.560 --> 41:37.560
Another, let's say, that's a real space.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.560
Peripheral.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.560
See, even ocean of peripheral, it's already an ocean of...

41:42.560 --> 41:43.560
It's fans.

41:43.560 --> 42:05.560
Well, in a way, yeah. The expanse.

42:05.560 --> 42:11.560
Oh, this is actually, and then everything else that's not that,

42:11.560 --> 42:14.560
it's already the expanse in regard to it.

42:14.560 --> 42:18.560
That's where the mind is. That's where the space is.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.560
Like foreground.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.560
So background.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.560
The experience.

42:21.560 --> 42:22.560
Sure.

42:22.560 --> 42:23.560
Yeah.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.560
So that's why you don't...

42:25.560 --> 42:31.560
That's why when you have, even if you have a thought of doubt, what is space then?

42:31.560 --> 42:41.560
Find peripheral in regard to vent. And that's where the space is.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.560
And that's how it becomes impenetrageable to doubt as well.

42:44.560 --> 43:00.560
Because doubt can only be actual.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.560
Going back a bit.

43:02.560 --> 43:05.560
The whole thing we've just been talking about is,

43:05.560 --> 43:08.560
is there is a reason why we can also do...

43:08.560 --> 43:13.560
There's many things like internal external that's also spatial.

43:13.560 --> 43:14.560
Yes, yeah.

43:14.560 --> 43:21.560
Basically, the external would kind of naturally be attributed to anything that's sort of in space.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.560
In space, actual through the senses.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.560
Everything else, this whole, the expanse, I was referring to,

43:27.560 --> 43:30.560
would be kind of these in videos internal.

43:30.560 --> 43:33.560
But when there's also seen a simple tendency present phenomenon,

43:33.560 --> 43:36.560
not as the sense objects, obviously,

43:36.560 --> 43:39.560
but is that which is, which pertains to the mind,

43:39.560 --> 43:42.560
then, yeah, either way, whether it's internal or external,

43:42.560 --> 43:50.560
are seen basically as external in regard to you, to your point of view.

43:50.560 --> 43:54.560
Because, you know, for someone for the untrained mind,

43:54.560 --> 43:57.560
things around me that I can see touch, taste, mouth, and so on.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.560
Those are the ones that I can access that I can have.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.560
And that's everything is external.

44:03.560 --> 44:11.560
Everything that's not that is internal and I'm kind of in between and everywhere.

44:11.560 --> 44:15.560
And usually, people like that for them, their own thoughts are not even seen.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.560
There's something that exists.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.560
They clearly talk about what they think.

44:20.560 --> 44:27.560
They will not give it the same amount of existence as they would to the things

44:27.560 --> 44:29.560
that they can obtain through the senses.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.560
Why the mind? Because the mind would so far out,

44:31.560 --> 44:35.560
proliferate the towards the senses that became the threshold of what's real,

44:35.560 --> 44:41.560
what the being is, what the extent of the being is.

44:41.560 --> 44:50.560
And then everything under that threshold is just assumed to not exist.

44:50.560 --> 44:53.560
Although that's a contradiction in terms of existence.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.560
Because you can say this doesn't exist.

44:55.560 --> 45:02.560
Well, it clearly exists, but otherwise you can refer to it.

45:02.560 --> 45:10.560
How can you attribute non-existence to something that doesn't appear at all?

45:10.560 --> 45:14.560
You can't, but the fact that it's attributed non-existence to something means it has appeared,

45:14.560 --> 45:19.560
which means it actually exists.

45:19.560 --> 45:30.560
That's the same mind from the senses.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.560
That's right.

45:32.560 --> 45:40.560
Yes, that's what it means, like you can't.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.560
Every reflection, every contemplation,

45:43.560 --> 45:47.560
I didn't mention it in the last of the review,

45:47.560 --> 45:51.560
has to be rooted in the experience as a whole,

45:51.560 --> 45:55.560
mindfulness of the experience as a whole.

45:55.560 --> 45:58.560
It has to be rooted there, that has to be the starting point.

45:58.560 --> 46:01.560
And now think about space on the basis of that.

46:01.560 --> 46:09.560
Note on the basis of your preconceived notion of the space that you had from before.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.560
You actually have to...

46:11.560 --> 46:13.560
You might feel the craving to know about it,

46:13.560 --> 46:16.560
but I have to understand it on these terms, you can't.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.560
It's the same order to those terms.

46:18.560 --> 46:22.560
And there are several terms on the basis of the mindfulness of the experience as a whole,

46:22.560 --> 46:30.560
and then there think about space without losing that basis of that mindfulness.

46:30.560 --> 46:34.560
So basically that you descend space within that.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.560
You're going to assume it.

46:35.560 --> 46:37.560
You don't fabricate it.

46:37.560 --> 46:46.560
You find it for what it is.

46:46.560 --> 46:53.560
That's you.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.560
That's the point.

46:54.560 --> 46:55.560
It makes everything else.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.560
It reveals everything else.

46:57.560 --> 47:03.560
That's deep.

47:03.560 --> 47:04.560
The lens.

47:04.560 --> 47:09.560
The objective here.

47:09.560 --> 47:14.560
If you don't have that, do you have that view?

47:14.560 --> 47:15.560
Anything else?

47:15.560 --> 47:17.560
Be an explanation.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.560
Yeah, pretty much.

47:19.560 --> 47:23.560
And also, as I said,

47:23.560 --> 47:28.560
I'm pretty sure I mentioned that in the last episode as well, you have to know

47:28.560 --> 47:31.560
what you're supposed to do without view.

47:31.560 --> 47:34.560
You have to know that that view is not the end.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.560
It's just the beginning.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.560
That view, basically, is the view,

47:38.560 --> 47:40.560
upon which you can develop discernment.

47:40.560 --> 47:44.560
That view is not the discernment.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.560
The lens here.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.560
Yeah, it's here.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.560
It's too.

47:48.560 --> 47:52.560
It's too, exactly, for seeing things through that lens.

47:52.560 --> 47:56.560
But for most people, mindfulness and experience of all is the ultimate kind of

47:56.560 --> 48:00.560
combination of the spiritual practice, whereby you just stay mindful in this pure

48:00.560 --> 48:03.560
pristine awareness and what not.

48:03.560 --> 48:05.560
You just stay mindful with your ignorance.

48:05.560 --> 48:09.560
Because you're clearly not trying to revel in it.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.560
Oh, no, too much thinking.

48:10.560 --> 48:15.560
Yeah, too much thinking if you're thinking on a non-mindful base.

48:15.560 --> 48:20.560
Then, yeah, you're just revolving around the same, same ignorance, same assumptions

48:20.560 --> 48:26.560
and basically psychotherapeuticizing your way out of it,

48:26.560 --> 48:30.560
explaining it to yourself, managing whatever else.

48:30.560 --> 48:31.560
That's not the Dharma.

48:31.560 --> 48:34.560
That's not the practice.

48:34.560 --> 48:38.560
But if you establish the mindful base of the mindfulness of experiences of all

48:38.560 --> 48:44.560
then you can be all the thinking you want.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.560
Because then it's the right mindful thinking.

48:46.560 --> 48:50.560
It's the thinking, basically, it's the Dharma.

48:50.560 --> 48:56.560
Another thought for mental objects is Dhammas.

49:06.560 --> 49:09.560
But people are all dismissed by thinking.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.560
Is this thinking?

49:11.560 --> 49:13.560
Well, we look to them.

49:13.560 --> 49:16.560
All dating God did mindfulness of experiences of all

49:16.560 --> 49:19.560
as this kind of overwhelming spiritual experience.

49:19.560 --> 49:20.560
It's just mindfulness.

49:20.560 --> 49:25.560
It might provide you with some novelty perceptions and all of the feelings

49:25.560 --> 49:27.560
because you never mindful on that level.

49:27.560 --> 49:30.560
But it's just mindfulness of experiences of all.

49:30.560 --> 49:33.560
It's mindfulness of experience.

49:33.560 --> 49:37.560
And then you know when you're supposed to look for within that.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.560
And you know that, but even so.

49:39.560 --> 49:44.560
By the service of this, by the investigation of the meeting.

49:44.560 --> 49:48.560
You won't tell you the answers by itself, which is what people think.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.560
Just teach me what I need to know.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.560
I've heard it so many times.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.560
It's like, yeah, right.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.560
You know that it will teach you what you need to know.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.560
It will teach you more evidence.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.560
Otherwise, you will naturally be free from some sort.

50:01.560 --> 50:04.560
Yeah, that's what you have to take up with it.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.560
You're ready for some sort of perception.

50:06.560 --> 50:11.560
You need the right instruction here.

50:11.560 --> 50:13.560
The basis for contemplation.

50:13.560 --> 50:15.560
Think about the senses.

50:15.560 --> 50:16.560
Yeah, with that.

50:16.560 --> 50:18.560
And full understanding of the fire against.

50:18.560 --> 50:20.560
Full understanding of the same basis.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.560
Full understanding of what it's about.

50:22.560 --> 50:25.560
Full understanding of now that we are in our Europa.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.560
Full understanding of anything from the sutras.

50:27.560 --> 50:28.560
Think of that.

50:28.560 --> 50:32.560
Full understanding of wholesome is wholesome, unwholesome is unwholesome.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.560
Doesn't matter what it is from the sutras.

50:34.560 --> 50:37.560
The whole thing is fully understood from the basis of mindfulness.

50:37.560 --> 50:39.560
So this means it's a home.

50:39.560 --> 50:40.560
That's your meditation.

50:40.560 --> 50:43.560
That's your repulsion and that's your sum.

50:47.560 --> 50:49.560
Yeah, this how it says there.

50:49.560 --> 50:50.560
It's there.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.560
It's the same thing.

50:51.560 --> 50:55.560
It's holding with mindfulness while basically the right order of things

50:55.560 --> 51:13.560
being established through our thinking.

51:13.560 --> 51:17.560
I don't know if this topic is going to turn out to be exactly related,

51:17.560 --> 51:23.560
but it's using some of the same terminology we've been kind of thinking about.

51:23.560 --> 51:28.560
You've mentioned a lot of times the consciousness being external

51:28.560 --> 51:34.560
with the objects as both to thinking, oh my consciousness is here.

51:34.560 --> 51:38.560
I just kind of trying to think about that.

51:38.560 --> 51:42.560
It's not to say that you do need the sense base for there to be.

51:42.560 --> 51:43.560
Yeah, I see the problem.

51:43.560 --> 51:47.560
I mean, I said that in a very well-defined context.

51:47.560 --> 51:51.560
And that context was basically...

51:51.560 --> 51:54.560
It's not a level of objects that you see.

51:54.560 --> 52:00.560
It's on the level with the matter is because of which there are objects that you can see.

52:00.560 --> 52:02.560
And you're not seeing the matter.

52:02.560 --> 52:05.560
But when people don't know, when people still have assumption and conceive

52:05.560 --> 52:07.560
is that they're seeing that which matter is.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.560
I'm looking at the cup and that's where the matter of the cup is.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.560
Like I'm seeing the matter.

52:11.560 --> 52:12.560
I'm not seeing my perception.

52:12.560 --> 52:16.560
Then they would think I'm just saying consciousness is out there with that cup.

52:16.560 --> 52:19.560
Which again,

52:19.560 --> 52:23.560
could actually aid somebody in right thinking,

52:23.560 --> 52:25.560
even if they say it wrongly.

52:25.560 --> 52:28.560
If they investigate further, they'll find out, okay, surely it's not with the cup.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.560
But it's with the matter of the cup.

52:30.560 --> 52:34.560
Which obviously I have perception in regard to because of, but I can't perceive it.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.560
Which means you can't even exist consciousness like that.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.560
But it belongs.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.560
It's oriented from the point of view of the matter,

52:41.560 --> 52:45.560
not from your point of view of the inside of whatever you assume.

52:45.560 --> 52:49.560
When you say that, that kind of gave me a start.

52:49.560 --> 52:52.560
Matter, it could be like this matter, that matter.

52:52.560 --> 52:55.560
I'm not obviously just needing what is actually matter,

52:55.560 --> 52:58.560
but like the base or the other, if they're both matter,

52:58.560 --> 53:00.560
consciousness is saying it's on that level.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.560
Yes, external.

53:02.560 --> 53:03.560
Yes, because that matter is external.

53:03.560 --> 53:05.560
Consisting is bound with it.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.560
Okay, that clarifies.

53:07.560 --> 53:08.560
Because yeah, I was thinking, like,

53:08.560 --> 53:10.560
they're really with the cup.

53:10.560 --> 53:11.560
Yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.560
No, you would just be basically like,

53:13.560 --> 53:15.560
well, I'm sure they were using philosophy,

53:15.560 --> 53:17.560
they were just saying consciousness in our day.

53:17.560 --> 53:19.560
And I mean, my even, even in existentialism,

53:19.560 --> 53:21.560
such, they were saying,

53:21.560 --> 53:23.560
but obviously it was quite clear.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.560
But the way he would put it,

53:25.560 --> 53:28.560
was intentionality is out there with the things.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.560
And in a way, that's true.

53:30.560 --> 53:32.560
Because then that out there,

53:32.560 --> 53:36.560
oh, that means basically this inside is internal of me.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.560
It comes out there.

53:37.560 --> 53:39.560
It comes because of the things.

53:39.560 --> 53:41.560
You can have these thoughts about,

53:41.560 --> 53:43.560
oh, I'm going to do this and this and this with that.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.560
And that thing over there,

53:45.560 --> 53:48.560
only because those things are already given.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.560
But it doesn't need to be qualified,

53:52.560 --> 53:54.560
because it's too easily assumed.

53:54.560 --> 53:57.560
It's too complex to be just put in one sentence,

53:57.560 --> 53:59.560
without it being misunderstood by somebody

53:59.560 --> 54:02.560
who's coming from the point of view of wrong views.

54:02.560 --> 54:05.560
Compossibly, just get that right.

54:06.560 --> 54:08.560
No, I think that clearly

54:08.560 --> 54:11.560
seems quite clear.

54:11.560 --> 54:12.560
So next time.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.560
Yeah, sure.

54:23.560 --> 54:25.560
Doesn't even say,

54:25.560 --> 54:26.560
it's the same time also,

54:26.560 --> 54:28.560
it's not obviously the matter,

54:28.560 --> 54:29.560
it's conscious, so to say,

54:29.560 --> 54:31.560
it's consciousness, it's conscious.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.560
Is that so?

54:33.560 --> 54:36.560
But they need each other.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.560
No, really.

54:38.560 --> 54:40.560
That's the ultimate thing.

54:40.560 --> 54:41.560
No.

54:41.560 --> 54:43.560
That's when you really use the word juxtaposed,

54:43.560 --> 54:46.560
when you came to consciousness and the matter.

54:46.560 --> 54:48.560
They're not even connected.

54:48.560 --> 54:53.560
They're just placed side by side for no reason.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.560
And that's a whole life.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.560
No reason to.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.560
No reason, no preparation.

54:59.560 --> 55:03.560
No preparation or suffering.

55:03.560 --> 55:06.560
But like, you need the eye in a certain state

55:06.560 --> 55:09.560
for there to be visual conscious, no?

55:09.560 --> 55:11.560
Like, yes.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.560
Like, stab my eyes.

55:13.560 --> 55:16.560
There's not going to be that conscious anymore.

55:16.560 --> 55:17.560
Yeah, sure.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.560
Well, look, they won't be under the matter.

55:19.560 --> 55:22.560
And then the consciousness won't be their idea.

55:22.560 --> 55:24.560
You can't have a pair side by side

55:24.560 --> 55:26.560
if one of the pair is missing.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.560
So you're saying they're a pair,

55:28.560 --> 55:29.560
but...

55:29.560 --> 55:30.560
Jack's supposed.

55:30.560 --> 55:31.560
They're not in the same footing.

55:31.560 --> 55:33.560
They're just there.

55:33.560 --> 55:36.560
And again, you can don't think they're in space.

55:36.560 --> 55:39.560
They're not sitting there next to you on the fire branch,

55:39.560 --> 55:41.560
talking to each other.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.560
There's completely Jack's supposed.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.560
Everywhere and nowhere.

55:45.560 --> 55:47.560
So to speak, because you can't put it in space.

55:47.560 --> 55:49.560
One of the actors is Jack's supposed.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.560
Is Jack's supposed to superimpose?

55:51.560 --> 55:54.560
Well, see, like superimposed,

55:54.560 --> 55:57.560
kind of implies a direction.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.560
Superimposed.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.560
Superimposed doesn't.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.560
Is this place side by side?

56:03.560 --> 56:05.560
And the result of that placement

56:05.560 --> 56:07.560
is the whole rising manifestation

56:07.560 --> 56:09.560
of the fire ivy ex

56:09.560 --> 56:13.560
of the ore of Namhoopa.

56:13.560 --> 56:15.560
That placement is removed.

56:15.560 --> 56:20.560
And you can't even conceive that Jack's supposed relationship.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.560
You can discern it right away,

56:22.560 --> 56:25.560
but you can't actually access it,

56:25.560 --> 56:28.560
because it's way below your feet and always moving.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.560
So then you recognize

56:30.560 --> 56:33.560
that the entire experience that you have,

56:33.560 --> 56:34.560
as you just said,

56:34.560 --> 56:37.560
all you need to do is have your eyes removed.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.560
And it's gone.

56:39.560 --> 56:41.560
The whole domain of vision,

56:41.560 --> 56:43.560
everything you ever seen,

56:43.560 --> 56:45.560
everything you ever would have seen,

56:45.560 --> 56:47.560
everything you ever experienced,

56:47.560 --> 56:48.560
any feelings you experience,

56:48.560 --> 56:50.560
an account of things you've seen,

56:50.560 --> 56:52.560
thoughts, plans,

56:52.560 --> 56:54.560
happiness, sadness,

56:54.560 --> 56:56.560
for eons and eons of lifetimes,

56:56.560 --> 56:58.560
and that's it.

57:02.560 --> 57:04.560
Your eyes have been removed.

57:04.560 --> 57:06.560
The whole vision's gone.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.560
But just the thing is,

57:11.560 --> 57:13.560
then you're reborn again.

57:13.560 --> 57:14.560
Right, yeah.

57:14.560 --> 57:17.560
It was using us like just trying to get the terms.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.560
Yeah.

57:21.560 --> 57:23.560
And you can't even,

57:23.560 --> 57:25.560
you can't take possession

57:25.560 --> 57:27.560
of that relationship,

57:27.560 --> 57:30.560
which means you're just borrowing.

57:30.560 --> 57:34.560
You're just basically a user

57:34.560 --> 57:37.560
of that which doesn't belong to you,

57:37.560 --> 57:39.560
yet you use it as if it is you want.

57:39.560 --> 57:44.560
Eyes, nose, ears, tongue, body, thoughts.

57:47.560 --> 57:50.560
But because of which those things are,

57:50.560 --> 57:55.560
you can't possibly access or have or influence.

57:55.560 --> 57:58.560
Is this just completely inaccessible for my redirection?

57:58.560 --> 58:00.560
You're taking the answer.

58:00.560 --> 58:01.560
Thank you.

58:01.560 --> 58:02.560
Just writing your eyes and stories,

58:02.560 --> 58:04.560
and then don't mind the prince of it.

58:04.560 --> 58:05.560
Oh yeah, sure, sure, sure.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.560
I'm just referring to the actual,

58:07.560 --> 58:10.560
the whole, the circumstantial nature of it,

58:10.560 --> 58:12.560
inaccessible, which means all you know is,

58:12.560 --> 58:15.560
it's not going to be.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.560
It is, but it's not going to be.

58:17.560 --> 58:19.560
No, not being for me.

58:19.560 --> 58:20.560
That's for sure.

58:20.560 --> 58:21.560
Exactly.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.560
Yeah.

58:23.560 --> 58:26.560
So you don't want to overshure the mark,

58:26.560 --> 58:31.560
but you certainly must not undershoot it either.

58:31.560 --> 58:32.560
And by that I mean,

58:32.560 --> 58:35.560
you don't want to start conceiving the access

58:35.560 --> 58:40.560
to that because of which your vision is there,

58:40.560 --> 58:42.560
to that because of which

58:42.560 --> 58:48.560
you smell, taste, sounds, touch, thoughts are there.

58:48.560 --> 58:50.560
By not conceiving the access,

58:50.560 --> 58:52.560
you stop maintaining the wrong assumptions.

58:52.560 --> 58:54.560
You don't fade out.

58:54.560 --> 58:56.560
And then, in the scene, there is just a scene,

58:56.560 --> 58:58.560
in the house, there is just a head, and so on.

58:58.560 --> 59:01.560
So just to clarify my own head

59:01.560 --> 59:04.560
isn't going to be repeating probably things.

59:04.560 --> 59:06.560
That's fine.

59:06.560 --> 59:09.560
Matter and consciousness paired,

59:09.560 --> 59:12.560
but entirely different.

59:12.560 --> 59:13.560
Not connected.

59:13.560 --> 59:15.560
Not connected.

59:15.560 --> 59:19.560
But it's there, like they're paired together,

59:19.560 --> 59:21.560
but not connected in any way.

59:21.560 --> 59:23.560
It just happens to be in that.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.560
Yeah.

59:25.560 --> 59:31.560
And result of that complete circumstantial checks the posing

59:31.560 --> 59:35.560
is your whole existence.

59:35.560 --> 59:37.560
And it always was, no matter of the realm,

59:37.560 --> 59:39.560
no matter of the river.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.560
That was always the case,

59:41.560 --> 59:45.560
for devils, for animals.

59:45.560 --> 59:47.560
Nobody's exempt from it.

59:47.560 --> 59:51.560
Yet, it's complete circumstantial.

59:51.560 --> 59:55.560
I feel like you could drill something in that,

59:55.560 --> 59:59.560
but still have plenty of assumptions about other things.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.560
Yeah, you just need to drill it longer,

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.560
until it saturates everything else.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.560
That's fine.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:31.560
I feel like you could drill something in that,

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.560
you could drill something in that.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.560
You could drill something in that.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.560
You could drill something in that.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.560
It's a matter of consciousness.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.560
It's a matter of consciousness.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.560
It's about the domain of Peter, either.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.560
He's very good.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.560
He said that once, like he can't say,

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.560
when his letters in other years,

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.560
he said, like, he can't say consciousness of consciousness.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.560
Like people use word consciousness.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.560
Every day, people will not come by consciousness.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.560
How many of them include yourself?

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.560
What do you refer to when you say consciousness?

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.560
Final.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.560
Clarified.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.560
Has the Buddha said in the Suhrer so many times,

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.560
don't believe many, many are unturned?

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.560
Investigate the meaning, interrogate yourself,

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.560
until things are clear.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:30.560
And again, not for the purpose of intellectual satisfaction,

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.560
but for the purpose of full freedom from suffering.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.560
Because if this interrogate, self interrogation,

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.560
and you're asking the meaning is done,

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.560
on the basis of the mindfulness of the experience at all,

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.560
then the knowledge will result from freedom from suffering.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.560
It cannot be any other way.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.560
Clarified.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.560
We say that we can discern consciousness

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.560
because things appear, like we can't see it.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.560
You can know that it's there.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.560
Yes.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.560
But it is very important that,

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.560
no matter what contemplation doing,

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.560
writing it down, thinking and pondering,

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.560
to do it on the basis of the mindfulness of the experience at all.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560
And that can be established on almost anything,

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.560
general, and you discern things with it,

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.560
with it, with it.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.560
Sure, but it can.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.560
Ask your knowledge.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.560
Yes.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.560
Hold on, I'm just here, present in this room on double downhill

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.560
in the central province,

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.560
on the island, surrounded by the ocean,

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.560
on the planet Earth.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560
That's all true.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.560
In the universe.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.560
In the universe.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.560
In the expanse.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.560
And the personal general does,

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.560
it does appear,

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.560
not like consciousness, that true.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.560
Yes, it appears.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.560
But obviously peripheral appears

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.560
to less detect the intensity of the actual.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.560
But it's different than the relation

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.560
between consciousness and others.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.560
Yes.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.560
The consciousness is the dead direction from which

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.560
where peripheral is then found.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.560
So the ultimate peripheral is the peripheral of the dead

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.560
of the earth, which is peripheral of consciousness.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.560
The ultimate negative.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.560
Exactly.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:44.560
When we establish the awareness

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.560
of something perishable,

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.560
then it's my way.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.560
It's not the same thing,

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.560
it's just completely forgetting about it.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.560
But it still has to be there to some degree,

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.560
but then there's...

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.560
Well, that's how mindfulness is properly established,

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.560
but it's really.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.560
The actual mindfulness is not mindfulness.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.560
It's going...

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.560
So the mindfulness is...

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.560
That's where mindfulness is established

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.560
on the peripheral level.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.560
Hence, people are not aware of peripheral,

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.560
and not mindful.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.560
But it's still kept in mind,

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.560
even though it's peripheral.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.560
Yes, that's what it means.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.560
Like, you don't...

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.560
You don't need to keep the peripheral in mind.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.560
Peripheral is already there.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.560
Hence, by discerning it,

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:32.560
you become mindful.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.560
It's actually, by knowing the peripheral,

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.560
you become mindful.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.560
You can't unknow it.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.560
You're not doing it.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.560
You might be doing it in the beginning

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.560
because you don't know how to do it,

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.560
and then you try to do it,

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.560
which is what you're doing.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.560
But by discerning the peripheral,

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.560
you are mindful of it.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.560
That's mindfulness.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.560
That's what it is.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.560
So simply by knowing the peripheral

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.560
level,

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.560
if I'm sitting in the coody,

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.560
you could think of that as,

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.560
look at that peripherally.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.560
When you're saying, actually,

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.560
it's not like actual versus imaginary.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.560
It's present peripherally.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.560
Like, I'm in the coody.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.560
No, not in a sense of imaginary.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.560
Oh, okay.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.560
Like, you're thinking,

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.560
I'm sitting in the chair now.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.560
I'm sitting in this chair.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.560
That's actually the front.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.560
Yeah, it's basically what you're attending right there right now

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.560
in front of you.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.560
By then, the presence of the chair,

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.560
the presence of your body, the body posture,

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.560
the room,

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.560
the anterior,

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.560
the normal type of vehicle,

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.560
the health, the element of the earth,

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.560
all those peripheral,

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.560
that your mind can discern

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.560
and become established upon.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.560
So, that doesn't mean

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.560
you become completely oblivious to the actual.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.560
No, that means

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.560
you make that

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.560
new peripheral,

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.560
sorry, you make that peripheral a new actual.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.560
No, it means you're mindful

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.560
of that peripheral in regard to

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.560
whatever happened to be actual.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.560
So, again, is that relationship?

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.560
Two simultaneous,

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.560
present things, peripheral and actual.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.560
I don't think you could actually even forget the actual.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.560
You could actually even forget the actual

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.560
entirely if that's been actual.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.560
Exactly.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.560
Exactly, that's the whole point.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560
When you recognize that you

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560
can't forget it,

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.560
that's like the other meeting mindfulness

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.560
and even the act of forgetting

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.560
your mind full of.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.560
And then the act of remembering

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.560
your mind full of.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.560
There's no any more

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.560
any induction of ignorance in regard to those things.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.560
It's impossible.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.560
It's going to be the one percent

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.560
of either actual or at least one percent

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.560
of either peripheral,

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.560
kind of 100 percent of all.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.560
So, that one percent is

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.560
more than enough

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:32.560
to establish your mindfulness.
