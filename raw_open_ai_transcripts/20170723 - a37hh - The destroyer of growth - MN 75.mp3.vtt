00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
So this is the Majuminikaya 75 to Magandia.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Thus have I heard.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.800
I want to occasion the blessed one was living in Prudu country where there was a town of

00:25.800 --> 00:33.200
Prudu's name, Kamasama, Kamasama. On a spread of grass in the fire chamber of a

00:33.200 --> 00:41.700
Brahmin belonging to the Buddha Vajra clan, then when it was morning, the blessed one dressed

00:41.700 --> 00:48.360
and taking his bow and outer road went into Kamasadama for alms. He had wandered for alms

00:48.360 --> 00:53.640
in Kamasadama and had returned from his alms. After his meal, he went to a certain

00:53.640 --> 01:00.360
road for the days of biding. Having entered the grove, he sat down at the root of the tree

01:00.360 --> 01:09.880
for the days of biding. Then the wanderer, Magandia, while walking and wandering for exercise,

01:09.880 --> 01:21.200
went to the fire chamber of the Brahmin belonging to the Buddha Vajra clan.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.960
There he saw a spread of grass prepared and asked the Brahmin, for whom has this spread

01:26.960 --> 01:32.780
of grass being prepared in the master Bhada Vajra's fire chamber. It seems like it might

01:32.780 --> 01:37.200
be a recruse's bed.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.200
Master Magandia, there is a recruse Goetama, the son of the Suckian, who went forth from

01:41.200 --> 01:47.800
the Suckian clan. Now a good report of the master Goetama has been spread to this effect.

01:47.800 --> 01:53.400
Blessed one is accomplished fully enlightened, perfect and true knowledge and conduct, supplying

01:53.400 --> 01:58.680
nowhere of world's incomparable leader of persons to be attained. Teacher of gods and

01:58.680 --> 02:06.120
rumours, enlightened, blessed. This bed has been prepared for that master Goetama.

02:06.120 --> 02:11.280
Indeed Master Bhada Vajra, it is an ill sight we see when we see the bed of that destroyer

02:11.280 --> 02:17.760
of growth, Master Goetama. Be careful what you say, Magandia. Be careful what you say.

02:17.760 --> 02:24.040
Many learned nobles, learned Brahmins, learned householders and learned recruses at full

02:24.040 --> 02:30.160
confidence in Master Goetama and have been disciplined by him in a noble true way in

02:30.160 --> 02:33.160
the Dhamma that is also.

02:33.160 --> 02:38.840
Master Bhada Vajra, even if we saw that Master Goetama face to face, we would tell him

02:38.840 --> 02:45.360
to his face. The recruse Goetama is a destroyer of growth. Why is that? Because that has come

02:45.360 --> 02:51.840
down in our discourse. If Master Magandia has no objection, may I tell this to Master

02:51.840 --> 02:58.640
Goetama. Let Master Bhada Vajra be at ease, tell him just what I have said. Meanwhile

02:58.640 --> 03:03.920
with the divine ear which is purified and surpasses the human, the blessed one heard this

03:03.920 --> 03:11.800
conversation between the Brahmin Bhada Vajra and the wanderer, Magandia. Then when it was

03:11.800 --> 03:17.440
evening, the blessed one rose from meditation, went to the Brahmin's fire chamber and sat

03:17.440 --> 03:24.840
down on the spread of grass made ready. Then the Brahmin Bhada Vajra went to the best one

03:24.840 --> 03:30.640
and exchanged greetings within. When this courtesan amiable talk was finished, he sat down

03:30.640 --> 03:37.720
on one side. The blessed one asked him, Bhada Vajra, did you have any conversation with

03:37.720 --> 03:45.600
the wanderer, Magandia, about this very same spread of grass? When this was said, the Brahmin

03:45.600 --> 03:51.200
all struck with his hair standing on end, replied, we wanted to tell Master Goetama about

03:51.200 --> 03:57.440
that very thing, that Master Goetama has not anticipated us. But this discussion between

03:57.440 --> 04:03.360
the blessed one and the Brahmin was left unfinished, for then the wanderer, Magandia, while

04:03.360 --> 04:08.160
walking and wandering for exercise, came to the Brahmin's fire chamber and went up to

04:08.160 --> 04:12.960
the blessed one. Each train's greetings with the blessed one, and when this courtesan amiable

04:12.960 --> 04:21.160
talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The blessed one said to him, Magandia, the

04:21.160 --> 04:27.960
eye delights in forms, takes the light in forms, rejoices in forms, that has been

04:27.960 --> 04:34.120
maintained by the litigator, guarded, protected and restrained. Any teacher stood down

04:34.120 --> 04:39.480
more for its restraints. Was it with reference to this that he said, the records go to

04:39.480 --> 04:46.040
them as a destroyer of growth? It was reference to this Master Goetama that I said, the records

04:46.040 --> 04:50.960
go to them as a destroyer of growth. Why is that? Because that is recorded in our

04:50.960 --> 04:58.360
classroom. The ear delights in sounds, the nose delights in odours, the tongue delights

04:58.360 --> 05:04.960
in flavours, the body delights in tangilies, the mind delights in mind objects, takes the

05:04.960 --> 05:11.360
light in mind objects, rejoices in mind objects, that has been claimed by the litigator, guarded,

05:11.360 --> 05:17.360
protected and restrained. Any teacher stood down more for its restraints. Was it with reference

05:17.360 --> 05:23.960
to this that he said, the records go to them as a destroyer of growth? It was with reference

05:23.960 --> 05:30.520
to this Master Goetama that I said, the records go to them as a destroyer of growth. Why

05:30.520 --> 05:40.080
is that? Because that is recorded in our scriptures. What do you think, Magandia? Here, someone

05:40.080 --> 05:48.000
may have formerly enjoyed himself with forms cognizable by the eye. That I wished for, desired,

05:48.000 --> 05:55.280
agreeable and likable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. On a later

05:55.280 --> 06:02.120
occasion having understood as they actually are the origin, the disappearance and the gratification,

06:02.120 --> 06:08.360
the danger and the escape in the case of forms. He might abandon the craving for forms,

06:08.360 --> 06:15.360
remove fever for forms and abide without thirst with a mind inwardly at peace. What would

06:15.360 --> 06:23.040
you say to him, Magandia? Nothing, Master Goetama. And light lies with sounds cognizable

06:23.040 --> 06:29.480
by the ear, odours cognizable by the nose, flavours cognizable by the tongue and pendules

06:29.480 --> 06:38.240
cognizable by the body. Magandia formerly, when I lived a home life, I enjoyed myself,

06:38.240 --> 06:44.040
provided and endowed with five chords of sensual pleasure. The forms cognizable by the eye

06:44.040 --> 06:50.720
and sounds cognizable by the ear, odours cognizable by the nose, flavours cognizable by the tongue,

06:50.720 --> 06:56.920
the tangibles cognizable by the body that I wished for, desired, agreeable and likable,

06:56.920 --> 07:02.960
connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. I had three palaces, one for the rainy

07:02.960 --> 07:07.800
season, one for the winter and one for the summer. I lived in the rain's palace for the

07:07.800 --> 07:14.680
four months of the rainy season, enjoying myself with musicians, none of whom were men,

07:14.680 --> 07:21.360
and I did not go down to the lower palace. On a later occasion, having understood this,

07:21.360 --> 07:27.680
they actually are the origin of the disappearance, the gratification, the danger and escape. In

07:27.680 --> 07:33.600
the case of sensual pleasures, I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures. I removed fever

07:33.600 --> 07:40.440
for sensual pleasures, and I abide without thirst for the mind inwardly of peace. I see

07:40.440 --> 07:47.400
other beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, beings vowed by craving for

07:47.400 --> 07:53.080
sensual pleasures, burning with the fever for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual

07:53.080 --> 08:00.160
pleasures, and I do not envy them nor do I delight them in. Why is that? Because there

08:00.160 --> 08:07.200
is Magandia a delight apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unhulsing states, which surpasses

08:07.200 --> 08:14.480
even divine bliss. Since I take delight in that, I do not envy what is interior nor do

08:14.480 --> 08:28.760
I delight them in. Suppose Magandia a householder, or a householder's son was rich with great

08:28.760 --> 08:34.200
wealth and property, and being provided in endowed with the five chords of sensual pleasure,

08:34.200 --> 08:41.200
he might enjoy himself with forms cognizable by the eye, with sounds cognizable by the ear

08:41.200 --> 08:47.800
of odours cognizable by the nose, with flavours cognizable by the tongue, with tangibles cognizable

08:47.800 --> 08:53.760
by the body that I wished for desire, agreeable and viable, connected with sensual desire and

08:53.760 --> 09:01.280
provocative of lust. Having conducted himself well in body, speech and mind, on the dissolution

09:01.280 --> 09:07.720
of the body, after death, he might reappear in a happy destination, in the heavenly world,

09:07.720 --> 09:12.400
in the retinue of the guards of the thirty-two, and they are surrounded by the group of

09:12.400 --> 09:18.720
nymphs in the nun, nun, nun, dhana, and grove, he would enjoy himself, provided in endowed

09:18.720 --> 09:26.000
with the five chords of divine sensual pleasure. Suppose then he sought a householder, or

09:26.000 --> 09:31.760
a householder's son, enjoying himself, provided and endowed with the five chords of human

09:31.760 --> 09:36.400
sensual pleasure. What do you think Magandia, who did young guards surrounded by the group

09:36.400 --> 09:41.640
of nymphs and nun, under grove, enjoying himself, provided in endowed with the five chords

09:41.640 --> 09:47.760
of divine sensual pleasure, envied the householder for the five chords of human sensual pleasure.

09:47.760 --> 09:56.160
Or would he be enticed by human sensual pleasures? No master go to them. Why not? Because divine

09:56.160 --> 10:03.680
sensual pleasures are more accidents and sublime than human sensual pleasures.

10:03.680 --> 10:19.040
Suppose Magandia, he was a leper, with swords and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by

10:19.040 --> 10:26.280
worms, scratching off the scouts, with his nails caught rising his body over a burning

10:26.280 --> 10:32.720
charcoal pit, then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physician

10:32.720 --> 10:38.360
to treat him. The physician would take, would make medicine for him, and by means of

10:38.360 --> 10:43.880
that medicine, the man would be cured of his leprosy, and would become well and happy,

10:43.880 --> 10:50.280
independent, master himself, able to go where he wants, then he might see another leper

10:50.280 --> 10:58.400
with swords and blisters, and scraping off the scouts with his nails, caught rising his

10:58.400 --> 11:03.880
body over a burning charcoal pit. What do you think, Magandia, would that man envy that

11:03.880 --> 11:10.520
leper for his burning charcoal pit, or his use of medicine? No master go to them. Why

11:10.520 --> 11:15.160
is that? Because when there is sickness, there is need for medicine, and when there is

11:15.160 --> 11:32.440
no sickness, there is no need for medicine. Suppose Magandia, there was a leper with swords

11:32.440 --> 11:37.200
and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching off the scouts, or the openings

11:37.200 --> 11:43.840
of his wounds for his nails, caught rising his body over a burning charcoal pit, then

11:43.840 --> 11:48.840
his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, brought a physician to treat him.

11:48.840 --> 11:53.080
The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine, that man would

11:53.080 --> 11:59.280
be cured of his leprosy, and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself,

11:59.280 --> 12:05.040
able to go where he likes. Then two strong men would seize him, both by art, with both

12:05.040 --> 12:11.120
by art, seize him by both arms, and drag him towards a burning charcoal pit. What do

12:11.120 --> 12:17.200
you think Magandia? Would that man twist his body this way and let? Yes, master go to

12:17.200 --> 12:25.160
them. Why is that? Because that fire is indeed painful to touch, huts and scorching. What

12:25.160 --> 12:31.440
do you think Magandia? Is it only now that the fire is painful to touch, huts and scorching,

12:31.440 --> 12:38.480
or previously too, was that fire painful to touch, huts and scorching? Master go to them,

12:38.480 --> 12:42.840
that fire is now painful to touch, huts and scorching, and previously too, that fire

12:42.840 --> 12:48.800
was painful to touch, huts and scorching. For when that man was a leprosy, with swords

12:48.800 --> 12:53.560
and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms scratching the scab of the openings

12:53.560 --> 13:00.200
of his wounds, wounds with his nails, his faculties were impaired, thus though the fire

13:00.200 --> 13:08.440
was actually painful to touch, he would acquire a mistaken perception of it as pleasant.

13:08.440 --> 13:14.320
So too, Magandia, in the past, central pleasures were painful to touch, huts and scorching.

13:14.320 --> 13:19.760
In the future, central pleasures will be painful to touch, huts and scorching, and now

13:19.760 --> 13:29.000
at present, central pleasures are painful to touch, huts and scorching. But these beings

13:29.000 --> 13:34.600
who are not free from lust for central pleasures, who are devoured by craving for central pleasures,

13:34.600 --> 13:40.720
who burn with the fever for central pleasures, faculties that are impaired, thus those central

13:40.720 --> 13:47.960
pleasures are actually painful to touch, they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasant.

13:47.960 --> 13:55.560
Well, on that note, that's what I was saying yesterday in this program, when I was explaining

13:55.560 --> 14:02.640
that when people initially start practicing the restraint, they might feel like pain,

14:02.640 --> 14:09.040
pain in regard to sensuality, they see something with their eye, something pleasant, something

14:09.040 --> 14:17.440
with their ear or with their tongue, and it could be assumed that that pain was because

14:17.440 --> 14:24.840
of the restraint placed upon the senses. But actually, if one sticks to the restraint

14:24.840 --> 14:29.280
and doesn't give in to the senses, it becomes apparent that that pain is the very nature

14:29.280 --> 14:37.080
of the senses, of the central core, of the central desire. Which means that pain was always

14:37.080 --> 14:42.600
there, it just was never felt because it was never existed, because one just went with

14:42.600 --> 14:50.520
it, so in order to not feel the pain of that dark, you just quickly succumb, quickly say

14:50.520 --> 14:56.840
yes, so it doesn't hurt you. And the similarly I gave yesterday, I think, we didn't

14:56.840 --> 15:04.320
record it, but was like imagine you have a very, very strong dog on the leaf and something

15:04.320 --> 15:12.560
comes in its eyesight and you see it's beginning to run for it. And you know the dog is powerful

15:12.560 --> 15:16.680
and if you stay in the place where you were, it's just going to rip your arm and it's going

15:16.680 --> 15:22.320
to be very unpleasant and very painful. So, you just start running with it. And then

15:22.320 --> 15:27.480
obviously you develop also to use on a kind of enjoying the run or whatever else, when

15:27.480 --> 15:32.320
in reality you really have no choice. But going with the senses, why? Because saying

15:32.320 --> 15:39.320
no to it is just dreadful. You can terrify people and make them freak out. And that's

15:39.320 --> 15:44.240
why sometimes when the circumstances place a restraint on you, so to speak, when you

15:44.240 --> 15:52.600
can't get what you want, it drives people mad, that pain. So basically, even from the

15:52.600 --> 15:57.880
day one, when somebody starts practicing the restraint, the pain of restraint, it's

15:57.880 --> 16:02.440
not caused by the restraint, it's revealed by the restraint and that is the pain of

16:02.440 --> 16:07.600
the senses and sensual pain. And that's exactly what I would have said. All of us even

16:07.600 --> 16:12.040
when you were enjoying the senses in the past and all those people who will enjoy them

16:12.040 --> 16:18.440
in the future, those sensual pleasures are actually painful, like that fire that was

16:18.440 --> 16:26.120
always painful. So only the mind that is impaired in regard to that nature would blame the pain

16:26.120 --> 16:31.600
to lack of satisfaction of your senses, not the lack of actually understanding of the

16:31.600 --> 16:36.240
senses. So then when people feel pain on a ton of senses, they think it's because they

16:36.240 --> 16:41.960
haven't indulged them enough, they blame the restraint. But it's completely the other

16:41.960 --> 16:49.720
way around. It's the actual delight and lust, it's the dark that affects you, that it's

16:49.720 --> 16:56.120
so unpleasant that you kind of automatically just go for it, go for the pleasure. And then

16:56.120 --> 17:02.880
not just that you mask, cover up the dark, but then you also get the pleasure that kind

17:02.880 --> 17:09.200
of contain in the senses. So then you feel like you win both ways. You feel like you avoid

17:09.200 --> 17:14.080
the pain and you feel like you enjoy the pleasure on top of it. But the fact is that that

17:14.080 --> 17:20.160
is not optional. I mean, fundamentally it is optional, but for most people, it isn't,

17:20.160 --> 17:25.600
they're just too weak to say no to it. The fact that they're always driven by it means

17:25.600 --> 17:30.120
basically they're always slaves to it and that is no pleasure at all.

17:30.120 --> 17:36.000
But they don't see the actual fever, the burning. No, no. They blame the fever, the burning

17:36.000 --> 17:40.520
to the lack of satisfaction. So then they just think I just have to go harder for it until

17:40.520 --> 17:46.680
the fever, the burning disappears. But it doesn't disappear. You just cover it up. So

17:46.680 --> 17:50.360
you pursue the desire more, it does not make the fever and burning disappear, it makes

17:50.360 --> 17:55.680
it increase, it makes it burn even harder next time, which is going to make you run for

17:55.680 --> 18:01.600
it even harder as a result. But the whole kind of, the only thing you're going to accomplish

18:01.600 --> 18:09.800
is cover up, cover up of the same burning embers. You're about burning, yeah. Like the left

18:09.800 --> 18:19.120
is, it just has to take the charcoal to the closer burning. So the pain of the sense

18:19.120 --> 18:25.240
desire that's revealed by the restraint and just repeating that is belongs to the sense

18:25.240 --> 18:31.440
desire, not the restraint. The restraint merely reveals it. Hence the restraint is the

18:31.440 --> 18:36.560
necessary precondition for the rising of wisdom, for the rising of the understanding of

18:36.560 --> 18:39.760
the nature of things.

18:39.760 --> 18:49.280
But if you, if you're a stranger, you still have the, at all, the pain of the sense is

18:49.280 --> 18:54.240
still there. But you're not going further and getting more feverish.

18:54.240 --> 18:59.200
And the pain, the pain will be there for as long as it doesn't sink deep enough that

18:59.200 --> 19:03.400
the pain does not belong to the restraint, it belongs to the senses. And for that very

19:03.400 --> 19:09.320
reason, the restraint is actually quite pleasant. Fire will always be hot, even a hundred

19:09.320 --> 19:14.320
miles away from you. But now that you're not pulled towards it and you know there is

19:14.320 --> 19:19.480
no danger of you falling into that burning pit, you know it is. Why? Because of your

19:19.480 --> 19:27.080
restraint, because you don't go anywhere near it. Hence the pleasure of renunciation always

19:27.080 --> 19:29.440
shrunk the pleasure of, of sensuality.

19:29.440 --> 19:35.160
Yeah, the pain, the pleasure of sensuality is always there, it's always there.

19:35.160 --> 19:43.960
Exactly. But your mind will be, it will go everywhere else away from that sensual pleasure.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.800
Like that man was being dragged by the two stronger men to a pit, he would want to be

19:47.800 --> 19:53.880
everywhere else but that pit. Because you recognize that the whole pain, the whole kind

19:53.880 --> 20:02.760
of drama and proliferation and everything else and mess that comes with it, it's all on

20:02.760 --> 20:09.040
account of the sensual pleasures. So all you have to do is say, note it and you're literally

20:09.040 --> 20:14.920
free from that entire domain of misfortune. And there was another sort of it, but I did

20:14.920 --> 20:24.920
say all the fathers fight with sons, sons fight with mothers, brothers with sisters, brothers

20:24.920 --> 20:29.920
with brothers, kings with kings, nations, all on account of sensual pleasures, all on

20:29.920 --> 20:34.520
account of sensuality. All of the wars that are being waged, that will be waged, it's all

20:34.520 --> 20:42.520
on account of sensuality, nothing else. But it's all of that, it might not mean anything

20:42.520 --> 20:51.320
if a person on that individual, private personal level still don't recognize the pain of sensuality

20:51.320 --> 20:57.000
belonging to the actual sensuality. So the pain of saying no to sensuality belonging

20:57.000 --> 21:05.520
to the actual sensuality, not to you saying no. Saying no merely reveals it.

21:05.520 --> 21:13.040
So Sutta continues, suppose Magandha there was a leopard with swords and blisters on his

21:13.040 --> 21:18.800
wings, being devoured by worms, stretching the scarves off the openings of his wounds for

21:18.800 --> 21:25.440
his nails, quarterising his body over a burning charcoal pit. The more he stretches the scarves

21:25.440 --> 21:31.440
and quarterises his body, the fowler, more evil smelling and more infected the wounds,

21:31.440 --> 21:36.240
the openings of his wounds would become. Yet he would find a certain measure of satisfaction

21:36.240 --> 21:41.360
and enjoyment in stretching the openings of his wounds. That's just what I said. Basically

21:41.360 --> 21:47.440
the more you cover it up, the more you'll need to cover it up. And the more you'll assume

21:47.440 --> 21:53.680
that covering up is sorting it out. So you will get some satisfaction in pursuing desire

21:53.680 --> 21:58.640
because basically makes you forget about the pain caused by the very desire. Yes, it's

21:58.640 --> 22:03.760
become a more evil smell. Because that's all you can do. Make you forget about the pain.

22:05.040 --> 22:10.800
And that's why you can never satisfy a desire. And its nature is insatiable.

22:11.600 --> 22:16.720
For the very reason, that all you can do is forget about the pain, the pain, the dark,

22:16.720 --> 22:22.480
that it causes too. That's what people like to elaborate on their desires, not just going

22:22.480 --> 22:30.720
to satisfy them. Because if it provides a more elaborate, forgetful cover up of the actual pain.

22:32.880 --> 22:37.920
But only so for that dark to arise again, to hit you again.

22:40.720 --> 22:45.360
And then when your senses do break apart, when you can't use any of those domains for this

22:45.360 --> 22:51.360
game of cover up, then you just left with the pain. Which is why all age can be very high.

22:51.360 --> 22:54.240
For those who depend on their senses more than others.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.440
And continues, so too, Magandia beings who are not given last

23:03.440 --> 23:06.880
percentual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for central pleasures,

23:07.440 --> 23:11.600
who burn with the fever for central pleasures still indulge in central pleasures.

23:12.160 --> 23:16.480
The more such beings indulge in central pleasures, the more they're craving for central pleasures

23:16.480 --> 23:22.320
increases. And then more, they are burned with their fever for central pleasures. Yet they find

23:22.320 --> 23:27.680
a certain measure, a satisfaction, an enjoyment, independence, and a five-cold central pleasure.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.800
What do you think, Magandia? Have you ever seen or heard of a king or a king's minister enjoying

23:36.800 --> 23:43.040
himself, provided an endowed with a five-cold central pleasure, who without abandoning

23:43.040 --> 23:47.120
craving for central pleasures, without removing fever for central pleasures,

23:47.120 --> 23:50.880
was able to abide, free from thirst, with a mind ingridly at peace,

23:51.520 --> 23:58.400
or who is able, or who will be able to abide, help to so abide. No, master God to me.

23:59.280 --> 24:04.560
Good, Magandia, I too have never seen or heard of a king or a king's minister enjoying himself.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.640
Without abandoning craving for central pleasures, without removing fever for central pleasures,

24:10.640 --> 24:16.320
who was able to abide, free from thirst, with a mind ingridly at peace, or who is,

24:16.320 --> 24:24.160
who is able, or who will be able to so abide. On the contrary, Magandia, those recluses of

24:24.160 --> 24:31.120
Romans who abide, or abide, or will abide, free from thirst, with a mind ingridly at peace,

24:31.680 --> 24:37.520
all do so after having understood, as they actually are, the origin, the disappearance,

24:37.520 --> 24:42.640
the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of central pleasures,

24:42.640 --> 24:48.960
and it is after abandoning craving for central pleasures and removing fever from central pleasures,

24:48.960 --> 24:54.640
that they abide, or abide, or will abide, free from thirst, with a mind ingridly at peace.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.840
Then, at that point, the best one uttered this exclamation.

25:01.840 --> 25:10.320
The greatest of all games is health. Nibbana is the greatest bliss. The eightfold path is the best

25:10.320 --> 25:17.600
of paths, for it leads safely to the deathless. When this was said, the wonderer Magandia said,

25:18.240 --> 25:23.920
to the best one, it is wonderful Master Gautama, it is marvelous how well that has been expressed

25:23.920 --> 25:31.840
by Master Gautama. The greatest of all games is health. Nibbana is the greatest bliss. We too

25:31.840 --> 25:36.880
have heard earlier wanderers who were teachers and teachers of teachers saying this, and it agrees

25:36.880 --> 25:44.320
with Master Gautama. But Magandia, when you heard earlier wanderers who were teachers and teachers

25:44.320 --> 25:52.320
of teachers saying this, what is it? What is that health? What is that Nibbana? When this was said,

25:52.320 --> 25:58.800
the wonderer Magandia rubbed his own limb with his hands and said, this is that health, Master Gautama,

25:58.800 --> 26:03.280
this is that Nibbana, who I am now healthy and happy, and nothing afflicts me.

26:05.680 --> 26:15.280
Bless you. Magandia, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms,

26:15.280 --> 26:20.960
who could not see blue, yellow, red or pink forms, who could not see what was even and uneven,

26:20.960 --> 26:28.080
who could not see the stars of the sun and the moon. He might hear a man, hear a man with good

26:28.080 --> 26:34.720
eyesight saying, good indeed serves as a white cloth, beautiful, sparkless and clean, and he would go

26:34.720 --> 26:41.440
in search of a white cloth. Then a man were cheating with the dirty soil garments of us. Good man,

26:41.440 --> 26:47.200
here as a white cloth for you, beautiful, sparkless and clean, and he would accept it and put it on,

26:47.200 --> 26:52.880
and being satisfied with it, he would utter words of satisfaction thus. Good indeed serves as a

26:52.880 --> 26:59.440
white cloth, beautiful, sparkless and clean. What do you think, Magandia, when that man born blind

26:59.440 --> 27:05.760
accepted that dirty soil garment, put it on when being satisfied with it, uttered words of

27:05.760 --> 27:11.440
satisfaction thus. Good indeed serves as a white cloth, beautiful, sparkless and clean.

27:11.440 --> 27:18.560
Did he do so knowing and seeing or utter faith in the man with good eyesight? When also he would

27:18.560 --> 27:26.240
have done so unknowing and unseen, utter faith in the man with good eyesight. So too, Magandia,

27:26.240 --> 27:32.640
the wonderers of other sects, are blind and visionless. They do not know how, they do not see

27:32.640 --> 27:42.000
Nibbana yet they utter this stanza thus. The greatest of all gains is health. Nibbana is the greatest bliss.

27:42.000 --> 27:48.960
This stanza was uttered by the earlier accomplished ones, fully enlightened ones thus. The greatest of all

27:48.960 --> 27:54.640
gains is health. Nibbana is the greatest bliss. The eightfold path is the best of paths,

27:54.640 --> 28:02.160
but leads to safety to forgetfulness. Now it has gradually become current among ordinary people.

28:03.040 --> 28:09.680
And although this body, Magandia, is a disease, a tumor, a dart, a calamity, and an affliction,

28:10.320 --> 28:16.720
referring to this body, you say, this is that health, Master Gautama, this is that Nibbana.

28:16.720 --> 28:24.080
You do not have that noble vision, Magandia, by means of which you might know how, and see Nibbana.

28:28.080 --> 28:33.520
I have confidence in Master Gautama thus. Master Gautama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma

28:33.520 --> 28:42.240
in such a way that I can come to know how and to see Nibbana. Magandia, suppose there was a man

28:42.240 --> 28:48.160
born blind who cannot see dark and light forms, then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and

28:48.160 --> 28:53.760
relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The physician would make a medicine for him,

28:54.480 --> 28:59.280
yet by means of that medicine, the man's vision would not arise or be purified.

28:59.920 --> 29:04.080
What do you think, Magandia? Would the doctor reap weariness and disappointment?

29:04.960 --> 29:10.400
Yes, Master Gautama. So too, Magandia, if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus,

29:10.400 --> 29:15.760
this is that health, this is that Nibbana. You might not know that health or see Nibbana,

29:15.760 --> 29:18.640
and there would be weariness and troublesome for me.

29:21.760 --> 29:26.960
I have confidence in Master Gautama thus. Master Gautama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma

29:26.960 --> 29:30.480
in such a way that I can come to know how and see Nibbana.

29:30.480 --> 29:40.720
Magandia, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light forms,

29:41.600 --> 29:45.920
he might hear a man with good eyes saying, good indeed serves as a white cuff,

29:46.480 --> 29:50.480
beautiful, spotless and clean. Anywhere you go in search of a white cuff,

29:51.200 --> 29:56.720
then a man were cheating with a dirty soil garment. Thus, good man hears a white cuff,

29:56.720 --> 30:02.960
and he would accept it and put it off. Then his friends and companions would bring a physician

30:02.960 --> 30:09.440
to treat him, a physician would make medicine, appointments, encountering some nasal treatments,

30:09.440 --> 30:13.280
and by means of that medicine the man's vision would arise and be purified.

30:14.240 --> 30:20.800
Together with the rising of his vision, his desire and liking for that dirty soil garment would

30:20.800 --> 30:28.560
be abandoned. Then he might burn with dignity, ill will towards that man and might think that

30:28.560 --> 30:34.080
he ought to be killed thus. Indeed, I have long been tricked and cheated,

30:34.080 --> 30:39.440
and he frauded by this man's dirty soil garment when he told me, good man,

30:39.440 --> 30:42.400
here's a white cuff for you, beautiful, spotless and clean.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.560
So to Magandia, if I were to teach you the Dhamma,

30:48.560 --> 30:53.920
thus, this is that health, this is that nibbana. You might know health and see nibbana.

30:54.800 --> 30:59.680
Together with the rising of your vision, your desire and lust for the five aggregates

30:59.680 --> 31:04.960
affected by assumption might be abandoned. Then perhaps you might think,

31:05.680 --> 31:09.680
indeed, I have been long tricked and cheated and defrauded by this mind.

31:10.560 --> 31:16.160
For when assumption, when assuming I have been assuming just to material form,

31:16.160 --> 31:20.960
I have been assuming just to feeling, I have been assuming just to perception,

31:20.960 --> 31:26.400
I have been assuming just to determinations, I have been assuming just to consciousness.

31:27.120 --> 31:33.600
With my assumption as condition being comes to be, with being as condition birth,

31:34.160 --> 31:40.320
with birth as condition aging in death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair come to be.

31:40.320 --> 31:48.400
Such is the origin of this wholeness of suffering. I have confidence in Master Gautama,

31:48.400 --> 31:53.600
thus, Master Gautama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up from

31:53.600 --> 32:04.160
the seat cured of my blindness. Then Magandia, associate with true men. When you associate with true men,

32:04.160 --> 32:09.040
you will hear the true Dhamma. When you hear the true Dhamma, you will practice in accordance with

32:09.040 --> 32:14.720
the true Dhamma. When you practice in accordance with the true Dhamma, you will know and see for yourself

32:14.720 --> 32:22.320
thus. These are diseases, tumors and darts, but here these diseases, tumors and darts cease without

32:22.320 --> 32:30.080
remain there. With a cessation of my assumption comes cessation of being. With a cessation of being,

32:30.080 --> 32:37.200
cessation of birth, cessation of birth, aging in death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair

32:37.200 --> 32:42.400
cease. Such is the cessation of the whole, this whole mass of suffering.

32:44.560 --> 32:49.920
When this was said, the wonder of Magandia said, magnificent Master Gautama, magnificent.

32:50.560 --> 32:57.040
Master Gautama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were returning upright

32:57.040 --> 33:03.600
or had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost,

33:03.600 --> 33:10.000
or holding up a lamp in the dark, for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gautama

33:10.000 --> 33:15.920
for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sunday of Brookers. I would receive the going forth

33:15.920 --> 33:24.560
under the Master Gautama, I would receive the full admission. Magandia, one who formerly belonged to

33:24.560 --> 33:29.840
the other sect and desires the going forth and full admission in this Dhamma and discipline,

33:29.840 --> 33:36.080
lives on probation for four months. At the end of the four months, if the Bikus are satisfied with

33:36.080 --> 33:43.280
him, they give him the going forth and full admission to the Bikus state, but I recognise individual

33:43.280 --> 33:50.080
differences in this matter. Renable Sir, if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire

33:50.080 --> 33:54.880
the going forth and full admission in this Dhamma and discipline, live on probation for four months,

33:54.880 --> 34:02.000
and if at the end of the four months the Bikus being satisfied with them, give them the going forth

34:02.000 --> 34:08.080
and full admission to the Bikus state, then I will live on probation for four years. At the end of

34:08.080 --> 34:13.600
four years, the Bikus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and full admission

34:13.600 --> 34:20.320
to the Bikus state. Then the wanderer Magandia receives the going forth under the blessed one,

34:20.320 --> 34:26.960
and he receives the full admission and soon not long after his full admission, dwelling alone,

34:27.600 --> 34:34.640
withdrawn and diligent, ardent and resolute, the venerable Magandia by realizing for himself

34:34.640 --> 34:40.800
with direct knowledge here and now, entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life,

34:40.800 --> 34:45.600
for the sake of which Clansman rightly goes forth from the home life into homelessness.

34:45.600 --> 34:52.960
He directly knew, the birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, but had to be done,

34:52.960 --> 34:59.440
has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being, and the venerable Magandia became one

34:59.440 --> 35:18.480
of the elements. I like the fact that he wasn't, you know, he was determined, he didn't really matter

35:18.480 --> 35:23.360
if he went forth, but he was still going to do it, you know, listen to it, listen to take on the

35:23.360 --> 35:31.120
Buddhist teaching, go forth, no matter how long it took. Because he doesn't know. Going forth

35:31.120 --> 35:39.840
he's just got an external means, a statement, a livelihood and shown that, yeah, for somebody

35:39.840 --> 35:45.920
he came and destroyed the dam, right there and then, yeah, he doesn't matter, four months, four years,

35:45.920 --> 35:54.320
two months, two months, because he'll be doing the same thing, he'll be practicing the droward, renunciation,

35:54.320 --> 35:59.200
dwelling resolute. He'll be a resident, yeah. Yeah, basically dwelling resolute.

36:02.000 --> 36:08.240
One thing is to understand, but another thing is to stick to it, for as long as it is necessary,

36:08.240 --> 36:14.560
for all of the assumptions and habits of desires to claim, for some people it will take longer,

36:14.560 --> 36:21.440
for some people it will take shorter time, but without being reserved. But exactly, yeah,

36:21.440 --> 36:26.480
the resolution needs to be there, obviously resolution is possible only once understanding

36:26.480 --> 36:34.080
as a resident, if you know what you're supposed to be a resident, but, you know, the resolution

36:34.080 --> 36:41.360
in the world will help you. But what about the strength, if you say never again? Yeah, sure.

36:41.360 --> 36:55.040
But obviously, again, never again, might free, if they stick to it, might free people from

36:55.040 --> 37:01.760
central desire, but it's still not necessarily, doesn't mean that they will have the right view

37:02.560 --> 37:08.320
in terms of the dam and the ban, because the Buddha did say, even the Tuzuna can experience

37:08.320 --> 37:13.440
dispassion in this caste in regard to sensuality. And in three, he himself from it,

37:14.720 --> 37:20.320
but he can't free himself from other assumptions, assumptions of self, of conceit and so on.

37:20.320 --> 37:24.720
But obviously, it would be much easier for somebody who is free from sensuality to then understand

37:24.720 --> 37:31.040
the dam, then from somebody who isn't. Why? Because it's already kind of understood the principle

37:31.040 --> 37:38.640
of assumption. It just needs to be pointed out that very fact, the Padana of sensual pressures

37:38.640 --> 37:45.280
of craving has been obviously abandoned. So he needs to dwell on the nature of that abandonment

37:45.280 --> 37:49.920
and then apply the same to the sense of self and his conceit and then he'll be in the barn.

37:49.920 --> 38:03.120
And obviously, he can do that unless he's, somebody points that out to somebody who knows.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.480
Yeah, Timi was a resolute means of it. You don't take,

38:10.480 --> 38:19.360
you see the goal, you take nothing less than that, and that's what you're striving for.

38:20.480 --> 38:25.680
Yeah, the solution can be basically, can take many forms. You can be a resolute for the rest of your life.

38:26.720 --> 38:34.880
Any central pleasure that comes within the range of your senses, you will basically override

38:34.880 --> 38:42.240
the vision of pain, and dark, and burning embers. Why? Because that's how they actually are.

38:43.200 --> 38:48.240
You might not necessarily see that, but you took it off faith because the Buddha said it.

38:49.200 --> 38:55.040
And if you keep applying it, because it is so, it will take its roots. And then you will see it,

38:55.040 --> 39:00.000
so obviously you can take on faith wrong instruction and then no matter applying it,

39:00.000 --> 39:06.320
it will result in seeing it clearly as such, because it's not as such. But sensuality is as such,

39:06.960 --> 39:12.320
so you're kind of emulating seeing it as such, like overriding with your resolution,

39:13.520 --> 39:17.040
will result to you eventually seeing it for what it is, as such.

39:19.200 --> 39:24.160
So that's basically those people who practice some faith, they take on faith and they just stick to it.

39:24.160 --> 39:28.480
Yes, it's been made pretty clear.

39:30.640 --> 39:35.040
And I don't think, you know, if there is a resolution, if there is a restraint, if there is a

39:35.040 --> 39:40.080
virtue established, I don't think it will take too long for one to start seeing that actually

39:40.080 --> 39:46.000
they are painful. It won't be before too long before it becomes apparent that the pain

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
of restraint is not of restraint, but it's revealed by restraint and it's of the senses,

39:52.000 --> 39:59.040
of the desire. That is the first point of contact, with sense, something like with the central

39:59.040 --> 40:07.760
pleasure, the first point of contact is pain. Always, everything else, all the pleasure you

40:07.760 --> 40:14.560
then get from giving into those desires is built on top of those burning embers, which means

40:14.560 --> 40:26.000
they themselves are certainly not pleasant. Well, the rising essential pleasure, basically,

40:27.280 --> 40:32.400
you can pin down on your assumption of, in regard to central pleasure, the assumption that

40:32.400 --> 40:40.720
they are worthy and pleasant, which means you will pray for them. And craving for them will then

40:40.720 --> 40:45.040
make them, make you regard them as even more pleasant and so on, for it will feed itself.

40:46.640 --> 40:53.360
You stop craving for them, sensuality cannot arise. Agreeable beautiful objects in the world

40:53.360 --> 40:57.920
will still arise, but they will not induce central desire.

41:01.600 --> 41:07.280
So you recognize the sensuality, like beautiful sights, for example, are confined

41:07.280 --> 41:17.600
to the domain of sight, to the eyes. And then there is essential desire to see something beautiful.

41:19.200 --> 41:26.160
If you say no to it, you will experience pain, because that's what the desire is, pain.

41:27.840 --> 41:32.480
And people don't experience pain, because their minds are already far out in the anticipation

41:32.480 --> 41:38.480
of satisfaction of the desire. So they are already running, even before the dog started the

41:38.480 --> 41:48.160
aching level. But all you have to do is just stop and the pain will arise. And then, as I said,

41:48.160 --> 41:53.040
with some instruction and diligence and resolve it, but if you become apparent that

41:54.400 --> 42:00.880
that pain, like bigger small sometimes, doesn't matter, it's the pain of the actual sensual touch.

42:00.880 --> 42:07.680
It's the pain of craving, present, simultaneously, with the agreeable beautiful object in the world.

42:08.720 --> 42:13.840
So then you remove the craving. And what you have is just beautiful objects in the world.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.000
But no desire for them.

42:16.000 --> 42:31.760
So seeing craving is pain, simultaneously. Exactly. And that brings you to the well-other approach,

42:31.760 --> 42:38.400
the approach of four noble truths with Tanha, with craving, suffering is. So whenever there is pain,

42:38.400 --> 42:45.920
there is craving. So if you suffer on account of sensuality, it's because you crave. And then

42:45.920 --> 42:56.480
that's what sensuality is. Sensuality is craving for sensuality. As a whole, as a unit, that's what

42:56.480 --> 43:02.640
sensuality is. Craving for sensuality, for pleasures derived through the sensuality.

43:04.720 --> 43:09.920
That is sensuality. Thus you can rightly say sensuality is painful and unpleasant,

43:09.920 --> 43:17.680
because you can't have sensuality, then, without the main component of craving for the sensuality.

43:20.480 --> 43:28.720
So it's a semi-danger of craving. You see the pain, there is pain, there is suffering.

43:28.720 --> 43:36.320
The danger of craving, basically, craving for pleasure derived from sensuality,

43:36.320 --> 43:44.000
well, sensuality cannot be discerned if there are no operating functional, living healthy senses.

43:45.280 --> 43:49.520
But that's something that's completely obscured, because as I said, the mind is already out there

43:49.520 --> 43:53.680
with the actual pleasures, with the derived from it, which means you took everything that preceded

43:53.680 --> 44:01.280
those pleasures, you took that to granted. You made it big. Bava is there, sensual being is there.

44:01.280 --> 44:13.600
Your mind is far away from it, but dependent on it. So then, as I said, if your mind is fully dependent

44:13.600 --> 44:20.720
on the pleasures derived by the sense-base and sense-objects, if something happens to sense-base

44:20.720 --> 44:25.360
and sense-objects and something will happen, because they're not in your control, then the mind

44:25.360 --> 44:31.840
will be cut away with it. That is what death is. Being swept with the floods,

44:31.840 --> 44:37.280
let's sweep away your body, your five senses. So unless you climb down that tree,

44:37.920 --> 44:43.040
those sensed trees on the safe ground, when they're taking down, you will crash with them.

44:47.360 --> 44:51.760
So that is the danger, that's a real death, that's what death is. Death cannot touch you.

44:51.760 --> 44:56.080
If your mind is withdrawn from the dependence on the pleasure of the senses.

45:03.840 --> 45:10.000
So somebody, just all you have to do is just contemplate losing your ears,

45:10.000 --> 45:16.240
you're losing your life. And then, like, say there is an imminent danger of death,

45:16.240 --> 45:23.120
no amount of sense desire will override that. No matter how strong it was before, the fact that

45:23.120 --> 45:28.960
the very next second, you might be dead, you will drop everything you will do, everything you want

45:28.960 --> 45:35.360
to do, everything you will engage with. And most likely, a normal person will freak out.

45:36.240 --> 45:41.200
Become religious. Because they only will become religious. Start praying to the divine providence

45:41.200 --> 45:46.800
and develop a faith that everything will end up well for you. It's basically the whole purpose

45:46.800 --> 45:53.360
of that. Again, it's the same. It emulates the principle of centrality. You will hit by the pain,

45:53.360 --> 46:01.440
you cover it up with a pleasant desire. You will hit by the pain of non-central nature.

46:01.440 --> 46:06.320
You cover it up with the assumptions of everything will be fine. Again, pleasure, peaceful, it's okay.

46:06.320 --> 46:11.920
So, the whole purpose of human religiousness and superstition is a cover-up,

46:12.720 --> 46:22.480
is just extension of centrality. Hence, it's another type of upadana, as the Buddha said.

46:22.480 --> 46:36.080
See about the Parmas. Basically, belief, assuming, holding onto virtue, duties,

46:36.080 --> 46:54.080
extension into religion and so on, holding onto views, assuming the views. That's also comes under it.

46:54.080 --> 47:06.080
It was a good to know because the greatest of happiness, the most people, is a fully functional,

47:06.080 --> 47:14.080
healthy, strong body that can take you around and get all those pages. That's like the peak.

47:16.080 --> 47:19.840
Happiness, you can imagine. Which is simultaneously the peak of the danger.

47:19.840 --> 47:29.040
It means that when you are dependent, you are blind. Like you are not aware of it,

47:29.840 --> 47:34.400
because you are too far out with the expectations of pleasure. That's with the dependence in

47:34.400 --> 47:44.400
its full highest swing. The person might start withdrawing from the central pleasures when

47:44.400 --> 47:50.400
senses start failing. However, if you wait for your senses to start failing and then withdraw,

47:50.400 --> 47:54.240
well, you are not withdrawing. You are being withdrawn. And then what you're going to have,

47:54.240 --> 48:00.400
then you're going to have views and also assumptions based on that. Now, you cannot undo.

48:01.440 --> 48:05.360
Because it's kind of too late, basically. Your dependence only has been 45.

48:05.360 --> 48:16.240
That's the danger of all age, basically. I mean, theoretically, it's still possible to

48:16.240 --> 48:21.840
approve it all and become an out of hand, but highly unlikely. Why? Because I mean,

48:21.840 --> 48:27.920
the habit of dependence on the senses has been calculated manyfold. Much longer than for somebody

48:27.920 --> 48:32.960
who has spent your 30 years old. Which means also to views and assumptions on top of that

48:32.960 --> 48:44.800
have risen. And now the senses have declined and show your ability to kind of experience the

48:44.800 --> 48:49.360
central pleasure has declined, but not the assumption of the pleasures of the senses.

48:51.520 --> 48:57.360
That has stayed. And now you have no kind of reference point for that to undo it.

48:57.360 --> 49:03.040
When your senses were still there, you could see a direct link, direct dependence.

49:04.080 --> 49:09.120
On your assumptions upon the central pleasures and everything else and the actual operating senses.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.040
But now the senses are gone and you're so oblivious in regard to them ignorant, deluded,

49:16.160 --> 49:23.680
indolent. It's virtually impossible. Here, I think it's possible, but highly unlikely.

49:23.680 --> 49:29.280
So, the longer you wait, as the Buddha said, actually, that's okay. You just read it.

49:29.280 --> 49:32.800
The longer you engage with sensuality, the stronger it gets.

49:35.520 --> 49:41.280
The more dependent upon it, you become. It means more painful, it will be saying no to it.

49:44.640 --> 49:50.640
Or rather, the greater pain will be revealed by saying no to it. And mine cannot take the pain.

49:50.640 --> 49:55.920
Untrained mind cannot take the pain. And what will untrained mind, which cannot take the pain,

49:55.920 --> 50:00.400
do? Try to avoid the pain, but it only means that it knows. Means of sensuality.

50:01.600 --> 50:07.600
So, you end up revolving around that, which causes you pain. You're using that to avoid that pain.

50:09.440 --> 50:12.720
Think about it, you can win yourself off of sensual pain.

50:13.600 --> 50:14.800
No, you can't do that either.

50:14.800 --> 50:17.440
But just a little bit. I used to have a lot of it.

50:17.440 --> 50:22.160
As the Buddha said, in regard to the being, and there is a being of sensual pleasures as well,

50:24.960 --> 50:31.360
he said, basically, that as much as a large lump of extremance instincts,

50:32.000 --> 50:36.800
even the small bits of extremance share the same stink, same foul smell,

50:37.520 --> 50:41.600
same goes for the being of any kind, same goes for sensuality. So,

50:41.600 --> 50:47.600
winning yourself off extremance with little extremance is no meaning of self of extremance smell at all.

50:48.160 --> 50:52.000
The extremance smell is the present. It doesn't matter the amount of it.

50:54.240 --> 51:04.400
How big the lump is.

51:04.400 --> 51:15.920
So, for example, about some of these, doing something innocence, you know, well,

51:16.800 --> 51:23.520
not so bad. That's still a distraction. Watching movies, watching movies, distracting yourself.

51:23.520 --> 51:29.920
So, it's not a horrible thing. You're watching action movies or whatever.

51:29.920 --> 51:35.200
And then, the person says, okay, well, that's distracting. That's got nothing to do with

51:35.200 --> 51:39.120
Dumma. That's got nothing to do with her life. Therefore, I will watch something with,

51:39.760 --> 51:44.800
we've got a, you know, connected to Dumma. Dumma movie.

51:45.360 --> 51:50.880
Well, there is no such thing. But then I will connect it to old age and death,

51:52.080 --> 51:53.600
never I'm winning myself off.

51:53.600 --> 52:00.560
Yeah, but see the point is, you turn a blind eye to the fact that the purpose of a movie is,

52:00.560 --> 52:08.000
sorry, the purpose of the movies in general is entertainment. It's distraction. It's taking

52:08.000 --> 52:13.760
your mind away. And that taking your mind away, it's nothing other than moha, the delusion,

52:13.760 --> 52:23.280
the indolence of the mind. As I was saying yesterday, delusion is, it's not a kind of a hidden secret

52:23.280 --> 52:29.040
truth that you're not aware of. You're deluded, you know, delusion is an attitude of mind

52:29.040 --> 52:34.800
in the same sense, anger is and lust is. That's why it's lust, aversion and delusion.

52:36.400 --> 52:41.440
So, sure, you might watch a Dumma movie that does not have the explicit sensuality,

52:41.920 --> 52:48.000
provocativeness and so on. But the fact is that you're engaging in the indolence of mind,

52:48.000 --> 52:54.400
why you let your mind go over the movies, let the story unfold, take your mind on a ride,

52:54.400 --> 52:59.760
which is not necessarily sensual ride, but it's the ride of the vision, the ride of indolence,

52:59.760 --> 53:06.800
which is basically that which is kind of underlying both, lust and anger.

53:06.800 --> 53:09.840
Your mind is never indolent, it cannot give in to lust nor anger.

53:10.880 --> 53:14.400
But if you're practicing delusion, basically, if you're practicing indolence,

53:14.400 --> 53:20.640
means you remain liable to lust, you remain accessible to lust, lust remains possible.

53:21.200 --> 53:27.600
So, sure, you can watch all sorts of documentaries and informative movies and whatever else,

53:27.600 --> 53:32.800
the fact is your mind goes in the state of indolence, which means when the lust comes,

53:32.800 --> 53:34.880
you will not be fortified in regard to it.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.680
So, there is no excuse for it.

53:39.680 --> 53:47.040
It's a non-indolence. If you remain non-indolent, you will not give in to any distraction,

53:47.040 --> 53:55.360
no matter how informative, inverted, comma, this, because Dharma is to be known individually,

53:55.360 --> 53:59.040
internally, by the wise, not on a big screen.

54:00.880 --> 54:05.120
And even if this is the movie about the Buddha's life, again, it could be watched as distraction.

54:05.120 --> 54:10.640
Because the only way to remain mindful of the movie is to basically not give in all of it,

54:10.640 --> 54:12.640
and that means why watch it in the first place.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.320
Same like reading novels or books of any kind,

54:19.680 --> 54:21.200
to the man to take the mind away.

54:22.080 --> 54:27.840
It's not as bad as, you know, full-on pursuit of sensuality in a binging manner,

54:28.400 --> 54:31.760
but it's certainly maintaining the indolence of the mind,

54:31.760 --> 54:37.280
maintaining the delusion, maintaining the ignoring of the nature of Venus.

54:39.600 --> 54:45.440
And that's an important point, because many people still have notions and assumptions

54:45.440 --> 54:51.520
that delusion, and even Avija, it's kind of, you know, this metaphysical ignorance

54:51.520 --> 54:55.520
that is then revealed by some extraordinary transcendental experience.

54:55.520 --> 54:59.760
It's not. It's the, it's something you engage most often.

54:59.760 --> 55:03.520
More often than sensuality, more often than anger.

55:03.520 --> 55:08.000
That's what Avija is. That's what delusion is.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.760
It's indolence of the mind.

55:09.760 --> 55:14.160
It's, it's, it's a muddleness, black clarity.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.800
And that you maintain that. People maintain that.

55:16.800 --> 55:19.920
You maintain it through sensuality, you maintain it through anger,

55:19.920 --> 55:25.280
you maintain it through ignorance choices, you maintain it through distraction and dependence on distraction.

55:25.280 --> 55:28.640
That's why you remove a distraction from, well,

55:28.640 --> 55:32.800
remove all of the distractions from a normal person out there in the world,

55:33.600 --> 55:34.880
and they'll, they'll freak out.

55:36.080 --> 55:40.960
The border will start creeping in, and then the border will reveal a peril behind it.

55:43.520 --> 55:49.280
A real genuine fear of, and threat, a real genuine threat of sinking into your own mind,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.080
and drowning there, going man basically.

55:52.080 --> 55:57.840
So, quickly, provide with some distractions, give me something to do.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.200
You know, it's devoted to weightiness, it's saying.

56:03.200 --> 56:03.440
Yeah.

56:04.240 --> 56:09.360
Which is, it sounds nice, like, you know, but it's quite a heavy thing to do.

56:09.360 --> 56:12.720
It's a heavy thing to do initially, but until you, until you still have the,

56:12.720 --> 56:18.960
the pull of the senses and so on, it feels like a heavy word, but it is, it is a heavy word initially.

56:18.960 --> 56:25.440
As we spoke in, was a couple of days ago, like a, like a, like a herdsman looking after the cow.

56:25.440 --> 56:29.600
While the cows are still wild and unrestrained, it's going to be a lot of work to keep

56:29.600 --> 56:33.280
them away from the heavy fields, from eating other people's crops.

56:34.640 --> 56:37.920
But once they are tamed and come down, then it's just pure pleasure.

56:37.920 --> 56:39.840
You just sit, you don't even have to move.

56:39.840 --> 56:40.560
They'll listen to you.

56:40.560 --> 56:41.040
They don't go.

56:41.040 --> 56:47.600
So, yeah, initially for a person who never practiced weightfulness,

56:48.800 --> 56:50.800
it's going to be the hardest task in the world.

56:51.680 --> 56:55.280
Because it's devoted to weightfulness means less sleep.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.800
Means less sleep even when you're awake.

56:58.800 --> 57:04.320
Yeah, that means less distractions means, means not resting mentally.

57:04.320 --> 57:06.960
It doesn't mean you're full engaging constant effort,

57:06.960 --> 57:14.960
but means you're engaged in non-resting, like the similar of a, of a cow.

57:15.600 --> 57:20.480
But if it sits down, it's being eaten by the animals, devoured by the animals that live on the ground.

57:20.480 --> 57:24.320
If it leans, something stands up and leans, if something's devoured by the animals that,

57:24.320 --> 57:27.200
that live on the trees that it leans and so on.

57:27.200 --> 57:30.720
So basically, no position of the mind you give in to that kind of,

57:32.400 --> 57:33.840
just the rest of five minutes.

57:33.840 --> 57:35.440
You can rest your body only once.

57:35.440 --> 57:38.160
Let me shut it. But mind is exactly, no shut enough.

57:39.440 --> 57:42.640
Why? Because actually, shutting off, it's not necessary.

57:44.240 --> 57:46.320
That's why delusion, it's a habit.

57:46.320 --> 57:49.520
A Vigia is a habit that's being maintained through a Vigia.

57:50.960 --> 57:52.960
Ignorance is determined by ignorance.

57:54.880 --> 57:58.240
And the Buddha said that, and the Vira mentions as well.

57:58.240 --> 58:05.040
So the point is, once the mind is straining weightfulness,

58:05.040 --> 58:06.320
weightfulness is effortless.

58:09.680 --> 58:11.680
And then it ceases to be a chore.

58:11.680 --> 58:17.680
It becomes a very pleasant place for a body. It becomes nibana.

58:17.680 --> 58:36.240
Well, as long as a Vigia is not entirely approved, exactly, a Vigia will try to maintain itself.

58:38.480 --> 58:45.840
So in the same sense, basically, that a person sees danger in centrality,

58:45.840 --> 58:50.640
sees it as burning embers, so should the indolence of the mind be seen as well,

58:50.640 --> 58:53.920
non-weightfulness. And that is, the Buddha said, the ones who are not mindful

58:53.920 --> 59:15.440
are already as dead.

59:23.920 --> 59:28.240
So living is quite difficult, we are living in it.

59:28.240 --> 59:30.560
Real living is a full-time task.

59:30.560 --> 59:32.240
I had, again, what Nabila said.

59:33.280 --> 59:37.920
It's not some life, it's not something you just float and fly over and go through,

59:38.480 --> 59:41.200
it becomes actually a full-time task.

59:42.400 --> 59:46.720
Even for the one who is not necessarily crazy for a lunch, it just wants to live authentically,

59:46.720 --> 59:49.360
wants to live responsibly, wants to live mindfully.

59:49.360 --> 59:56.720
Because it is that, anyway, like if a Patujana, a Sutta, a Patujana,

59:56.720 --> 01:00:02.160
are instructed without any regard, it's also a task, it's even worse, because he's making

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.360
it worse through ignoring it. He's making his itch worse through constantly scratching it.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.840
He's making more powerful each time, which means each time you'll need to work even harder.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:41.600
You can never have too much of mindfulness, and if you have too much of anything else,

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.880
mindfulness will even eat out, if mindfulness is established.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:59.920
Clarity of the mind, non-modernness, so to speak, clear thinking,

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.200
and restraint of the senses.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:14.240
Then even a very little of the instruction from the Sutta's and the Buddha will be required,

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:22.240
because the ground is very fertile, set up. Everything is there, ready, in the right order.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.400
Purify, then you need very little instruction to fix it up,

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:36.400
once and for all.
