1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So what is the point of celibacy, in terms of practice, what is the point of it?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Because many people are celibacy when they're not having sexual relations.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So why is it complete celibacy, potent or bad?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, you can say that even out of the practice of a Buddhist monk or just in general,

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
celibacy would be beneficial for a non Buddhist person.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And the most obvious reason why that would be is because you're not controlled.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're not giving in to a very powerful desire that otherwise controls and shapes up your whole life.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Because, again, regardless whether people practicing dumb or not, sensuality and sexuality,

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
it defines quite a lot of people's lives.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It certainly has probably the strongest influence.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So if you were to adopt celibacy as a practice means you would be going against that,

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that desire, that pull, which means you would be developing your mind in regard to that.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Because as you said, yes, sometimes people are celibate when they're not having sexual intercourse.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But that's not celibacy because when the opportunity comes they're going to have sexual intercourse.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But the point is to take it as a determination, as a practice.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then obviously it's much harder. In the same sense, somebody is trying to give it smoking.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's not harder to give a smoking if you decide to never smoke again.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
As opposed to if you think, okay, I won't smoke for a month.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then even the heaviest of the smokers can make it. It can last for a month.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But not if you decided it for the rest of your life.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So you can imagine how much more there is with celibacy.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But that's what I mean. If somebody does have the strength of the mind to come to the point of determining

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
an act of celibacy, means that the mind can start to develop on that level in that regard.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And yeah, if a person is celibate, they will eventually take time to kind of

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
drive the mind out from the sort of wetness of desires.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But once the mind is dried out, then literally everything else in the life in the world

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is depending upon non-celebrity. The celibacy they're free of.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay, so that makes me so beautiful.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, everything you're identity basically.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're identity would fail if a big person who doesn't practice done.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Say go beyond sensuality, sexuality, through practice of celibacy.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And they feel themselves from central cravings.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They would create a degree, be free of their own ego as well.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And they can see it and all the suffering that comes with it.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All the worry, all the anxiety.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let alone if they were to sort of uproot that as well,

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
be the right of you and practice of the dumb.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Because the whole life, person's life, an average person that revolves around following desires

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and getting what you want.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It usually revolves around sexuality, around finding a mate, a family.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The whole thing revolves around the very basic desires that are depliruted, obviously.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So if one is able to go against it, in a sense of not just pure denial,

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but in a sense of actually developing wisdom and account of it,

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
like seeing the nature of desire, but not giving into that desire,

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you can eventually overcome that desire.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And then you can imagine the freedom of that mind.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And then you can really compare it to being free.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Like being in prison, then being let out of the prison.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Crossing the desert, unknowing if you're going to make it to the other end.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And if you make it to the other end, it's like a huge relief, huge burden.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And again, I'm talking, even for somebody who is not practicing the dumb,

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
just sort of doesn't want to give in to their desires anymore.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And then overcomes that.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Quite a lot of release and relief.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Do you want to go and do that?

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, of course, because it's way too hard.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's way too hard for most people.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's why it's highly unlikely that anybody will do it today outside of some sort of real philosophy or religious practice.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Because there wouldn't be enough motivation because it's too hard.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Back in the day, they were back in the Buddhist time.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There were people who were just practicing for the sake of freedom of desire.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They were not necessarily followers of the dumb or anything else.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And that's why they did say people outside of this dispensation can't free themselves from these various forms of hope

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
but don't hold them in attachments and assumptions.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And the sensual desire was one of them.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But it's not just about giving up.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Celebrity in the Buddhist teachings, not just about giving up sex.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not just about giving up masturbation or not seeing women or not seeing men.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What I've read, it's more about the lighting in your own sexuality.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That is true celibacy, not the lighting in your own sexuality.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, it has to...

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, I see what you mean.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It has to start simply by giving up, simply by saying no.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But yeah, that is just the first step that you have to then go beyond.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you really want to be free, otherwise you have to spend your whole life just saying no.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But that's not freedom.

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's just resisting it.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But yeah, there wouldn't be no freedom if you haven't resisted it first.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So by resisting it by saying no to these types of actions.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In order to overcome it, then yes, you have to overcome that sensuality in regard to yourself.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You have to overcome the attitude in regard to your own body.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The attitude that it's basically regarding the body as a basis for pleasure.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And then you see a direct kind of relationship with the pleasure of your senses.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And this pertains to any type of pleasure, not necessarily only sexual or something.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Any type of pleasure you gain through the senses, you can overcome by overcoming basically the attitude of regarding your body as a basis for that pleasure.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
By appropriating the body, you appropriate that which body is attracted to.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
By not appropriating the body anymore, you free yourself from the counterpart of your senses.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So then you're not just resisting anymore.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then there is no need for resistance because there is no more pull.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But for as long as you're appropriating your senses, your body, you will be pulled.

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Which means you might spend the whole life living a celibate life.

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Which is good.

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's still better.

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But it's not, it's not living to wisdom and it's not living to freedom from centrality.
