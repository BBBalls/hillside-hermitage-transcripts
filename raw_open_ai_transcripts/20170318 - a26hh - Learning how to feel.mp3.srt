1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, I'll start off with this one. The question is quite common. How to make sati continuous.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You know how to be mindful of the right thing continuously. You're speaking with yesterday.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, well simple answer is by understanding what sati is. By abandoning the notion that sati

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
tends to do that momentary momentary moment to moment awareness or something and there's simply contradiction. It doesn't, you can't exist like that.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But I'm interested in the sati which is in regard to freedom of suffering. Right? The relevant.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Not sati to make my life better. Yeah. To make them more productive or smarter, more intelligent, more focused.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, not even, not necessarily just that, but even like even people who are into meditation techniques and so on.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The idea of sati is that observing for a moment to a moment to a moment and then you have the uninterrupted mindfulness.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But mindfulness is not structured moment to moment, structurally in a different heart after all of more general things, more general intentions,

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
more general states of mind basically whereby if you get established upon them, then the particular things,

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the matter how fast, how fleeting they are occurring, your mindfulness is not effective by it.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But if your mindfulness is established upon particular fleeting things, then your mindfulness will define the way with them as their cease.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So in the relevant manner, basically, yeah.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Establishing your mind at a more general phenomenon.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it can be various things in terms of establishing a mindfulness upon them.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So you don't have to, it's not like fixed, you must establish upon this. You can use your body, you can use your feelings, you can use your thoughts,

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,000
you can use the motivations behind your actions, you can use those things to establish your mind in regard to things you're doing at a particular level and that's already mindfulness.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So in terms of, if you want the most direct answer, how to be mindful, that's relevant to the suffering and feeling from it.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, you have to be mindful of your feelings or of the present feeling, whichever there is.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And even with the feelings you can see, even they have this kind of hierarchy of more general and more ambiguous and so on.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You know, because even the most kind of vague, the far above mood is always, basically, you can regard it almost as a feeling because it has a certain feel to it.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Because you might not be able to define what you perceive in terms of that mood as a phenomenon, but you can certainly say, yeah, it feels a bit, it's a bit heavy, so okay, you're perceiving happiness.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But all of those things you perceive, how do they feel? It's a bit unpleasant, so it's a bad mood.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Or you can have the most obvious, oh, this is a very pleasurable feeling that's coming as a result of me having agreeable perceptions, such as nice taste, beautiful sights and so on.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So if you're obviously, if you're only concerned with those things, then when those things change, when those things move too quickly, your mindfulness will not remain established because it was established upon that.

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But say you establish a mindfulness upon that general mood behind these particular things that are rising and sort of interacting with you.

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you establish a mind upon those more general, general sense of, you know, yeah, my mind feels light and expanded, which is agreeable, which is pleasant.

28
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So you can then establish your mind upon that level of feeling, or rather than feeling on that level.

29
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And then when you do have disagreeable perceptions, they will not induce painful feelings because your mind is established on the higher feelings, being higher than those.

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And although those are like in the surface, similar, established your mind upon the perception of forest, so then disagreeable perception of the village when you have to be in the village will not bother you.

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And it's for that very reason.

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So you establish your mind on a higher feeling?

33
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
On a more general feeling, yeah.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So you're saying I'm pleasant feeling to go to a higher feeling?

35
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You could, yeah.

36
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, no, if a particular disagreeable feeling bothers you, yeah, you're going to higher feeling. And you know, the ultimate higher feeling is accepting that you will die, not being afraid of death.

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then you realize, okay, so whatever has a reason, whatever arises, it will have to cease because it's not going to stay and beset me forever, which is impossible and conceivable.

38
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So then you don't even have to think that anymore when you've thought it's sufficient number of times, because then you just know that whatever has a reason has to cease, for whatever reason that it has a reason, nothing else, nothing other.

39
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So the whole idea of the, and that's what people fear pain. That's why everybody fears pain because when it arises, there is an implicit assumption that's eternal, that's going to last forever.

40
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So you just have that that kind of inside contains that inside fear that this pain that I know that I don't know and escape from, it's going to sort of affect me forever.

41
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Although your reason can tell you know, nothing lasts forever and so on, on that emotional level, you're locked in the assumption forever. And the same for pleasure, which is why, for a mind which is not developed, yeah, pleasure is overly intoxicating.

42
00:06:44,000 --> 00:07:03,000
After the point of oblivion and genuinely developing views, that yeah, you will endure and last forever. But if you start undermining that assumption, then when the pain arises, you won't feel it because you know that it's inconceivable for anything to last forever in that sense, in that emotional oppression sense.

43
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And in the same sense, your thirst for, for central pleasure is your pleasures that you can gain in regard to the world and so on. Well, that will also fade gradually because you realize, oh, that's not possible.

44
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Whatever, so why do I even bother? Why do you expose myself? It's just such a trifle sort of satisfaction in regard to it.

45
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So the mindfulness, establishing of mindfulness is basically establishing a mind on a more general level in regard to your present experience here as a whole.

46
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because if it's not in regard to the present experience, then it just becomes an abstraction, whatever you're thinking. It just becomes divorced from what you're actually doing. But if you establish it presently and you're aware of its presence, so to speak, then then it becomes very real and obviously very functional establishment.

47
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Whereby anything lower than that establishment, anything less general, anything more particular, I will not cannot bother you, cannot affect you.

48
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's why the Buddha said you should be taking this as far as necessary in order to develop final freedom.

49
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So then in that sort of dimension upon the perceptions of the forest, you've been perceptions of the village, then he recognizes, okay, so now when I go into the village, I'm not affected by any perceptions and I see they're agreeable or disagreeable because my mind is properly fully established upon the perceptions of the life experience as a whole in the forest.

50
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But he also recognizes the disturbances can still come on account of this perception in the forest. If something happens in the forest, I could lose my mindfulness.

51
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So then he takes itself further, then he establishes his mind upon the perceptions of earth.

52
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So then whether he's in the forest or even more lower in the village or even lower than that in a layman's house, crowded house, then he won't be affected because his mind is fully set, fully established upon the forest.

53
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So whatever he is on this earth, he'll be mindful presently. So theoretically he could lose that mindfulness of being established upon the perception of earth if he was to leave the earth, to fly into space or something.

54
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But if somebody is able to establish their mind to such a level of perception of earth, then they could easily establish it upon the perception of space, upon the perception of those general phenomena that pertain to the mind.

55
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So he would be fine even in space, basically. That's what I'm saying.

56
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So how do you make that perception of earth to not be abstract? You make it by discerning it in your present experience right here, right now, because it is then.

57
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But obviously in order to discern it, you need to know what it is, or at least you need to have some clue.

58
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And that's why it's important to basically learn and inform yourself from the sutras and pondering and discerning it as a phenomenon present.

59
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So only discern it in theory, because that's not a discernment, that's an abstraction.

60
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So there is a present thinking and there is the abstract thinking. And usually people can distinguish it too, and then they kind of disregard thinking altogether.

61
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But that's just a very bad idea, because if you think about solidity, an image is the kind of image of solidity.

62
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah. Surrounding. A concept of gossip.

63
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But when with feelings.

64
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No, because feelings don't appear as concepts, because there will be a perception.

65
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
There being felt, so you need to use the faculty of feeling to feel, basically.

66
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's why I think again, my teaching is for the one who feels, basically, he's teaching is for the one who knows how to feel.

67
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So just sort of being liable to feeling, it's not enough, everybody is that they actually have to know to discern how to feel, and then you will know the feeling.

68
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Because most people think they perceive, most people think when they feel they actually perceive it.

69
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah. When you say feeling, pleasant feeling.

70
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, you're going to see, that's what you perceive.

71
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
A concept of pleasant feeling.

72
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's absolutely whatever.

73
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So I can designate a pleasant feeling, but that designation is on the level of perception.

74
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Perception of sound, perception of art, perception of even a perception of a mental image of either words, pleasant feeling, written, or some pleasant experience.

75
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So it's basically always perception, and you can't not have the perceptions.

76
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
In a sense, you can't not have feelings, because they are inseparable, perception and feeling.

77
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But what you can know is how to feel in regard to that which you perceive.

78
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And not think that that which you perceive is the same thing that you're feeling, because then there will be a perception.

79
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So simultaneously, while you're perceiving, you're always simultaneously that feeling on a level of feeling.

80
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And those two levels cannot make, they cannot come together, they cannot communicate.

81
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
They're actually, like, blind to each other.

82
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Your feelings don't know about your perceptions.

83
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No, your perceptions know about your feelings.

84
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's your assumption that it's the same, that it's different, that it's both same and different.

85
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's not the same, the different in regard to perception and feeling.

86
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You mix it a lot, and then you assume, and then what you perceive is what you feel, what you feel is what you perceive.

87
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But feeling feels perception perceives, and that's it.

88
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And whether that thing is same, or different, or neither of both, it doesn't matter.

89
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But one is more general than you.

90
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No, no, they'll see, if you would say one is more general than the other, then they'll be comparable.

91
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And being comparable is only the form of relationship, and I said, they're completely unaware of each other.

92
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And because feeling is completely unaware of perception and perception is completely unaware of feeling,

93
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you can, you can, you can free both of them from assumptions and from the sense of self and everything.

94
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because if there were relationship, then there would be the agent in control of them, in regard to them, external to them, internal to them, whichever way.

95
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What about this, like, joy, joy, and one gets from it to, what, pity, pity?

96
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Uh-huh.

97
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So, maybe we spoke about, to will, to will that, to get that going.

98
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Uh-huh.

99
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And one can do that.

100
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah.

101
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
One can generate pity.

102
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

103
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, pity, partly pity.

104
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, pity, yeah. And a joy, one can generally enjoy, as an acts of will.

105
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mm-hmm.

106
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Obviously, if you, your mind is very depressed or something, scattered, unrestrained, that would have much practice.

107
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But you could, some say, to do that.

109
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And that feels good.

110
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah.

111
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And that way, it seems like I'm in control.

112
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, no.

113
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
No, no. You think you would be in control if you then appropriate that good feeling.

114
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That good feeling is just the result of the search of way of attending and intending.

115
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

116
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And that's absolutely fine.

117
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Mm-hmm.

118
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's why you shouldn't fear that pleasure.

119
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
When the Buddha said the pleasure in regard to Johnus and so on.

120
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He realized, hold on, I don't actually have to, because initially he was disregarding all of the pleasure.

121
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Any pleasant feeling was bad.

122
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But then, when he started developing Johnus, he realized, no, actually, these feelings are not underlined by any of those unwholesome things.

123
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There is no reason to fear this.

124
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
On the contrary, I should cultivate this.

125
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hence, he was declared as the ultimate way of basically getting in the right view, developing Johnus,

126
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and then you'll be fully developed on both ways, are they say?

127
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Through full understanding and through full development in regard to your body and meditation.

128
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Because, yeah, it's that good, or rather, it can be that good.

129
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Wherever you can intentionally call it with the right view, no, without the right view.

130
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But with the right view, intentionally cultivate joy or a rapture or whatever,

131
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and it won't be an also, because you would know it if it's unwholesome.

132
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because you're just intending.

133
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's just the result of the intention that's occurring.

134
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Not yours to begin with.

135
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's not in regard to your body.

136
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No, no, no, no.

137
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It doesn't pertain to the senses.

138
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's why it's not unwholesome.

139
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
However, obviously, you can appropriate that joy, which is why Kutugin and Ken developed Johnus.

140
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Obviously, he abandoned lots of central cravings as a result of it,

141
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
because this is much more supply and much more refined.

142
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But, yes, you could.

143
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's what I mean.

144
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You wouldn't be doing it rightly.

145
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If you then start appropriating that joy and feeling you are in control of that joy,

146
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
this joy is mine.

147
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But with the right view, that wouldn't happen.

148
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So then you would just have the proper practice of developing joy

149
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and the right view that sort of sees through any occurrence of lust, aversion, and delusion.

150
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So it wouldn't be before long that the mind would be completely free from all the hindrances.

151
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
With that development.

152
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Because there wouldn't be any agitation, there wouldn't be any anxiety.

153
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Even hardships would feel relatively lazy, because the mind gets elevated.

154
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The hindrances won't come up again.

155
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes, I say you become an arrogant.

156
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes, you become an arrogant.

157
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You don't want to say feeling is always in the background.

158
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I see what you mean.

159
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And you can, well, I think initially you probably have to, because that's where you're going to find it,

160
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
because the mind is not too used to much establish the contraception.

161
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And obviously, mind needs to learn how to feel, how to discern feeling among the things that it perceives.

162
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So yeah, and that's the entity in the background.

163
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You won't find it where you perceive it.

164
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You'll find it simultaneously in regards to that which you perceive.

165
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Basically, you have to refrain from attending to the feeling as if it's a perception.

166
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So you have to refrain from attending to the feeling as if you will see it.

167
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's not actually behind.

168
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's right there all the time in regard to whatever you perceive it to.

169
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And obviously, it has its own, well, its domain has its own laws, so to speak.

170
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So it's not as diverse as perception.

171
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's always quickly perception, but obviously it's much more subtle than perception.

172
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Beyond perception.

173
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, well, it's beyond in terms of it is nothing to do.

174
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They're not to the same place, so to speak.

175
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
While in place is there will already be applicable on the perception.

176
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Comes as a result of perception.

177
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Space in place.

178
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Feeling is in regard to it.

179
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So it's just like two dimensions that you just used to learn.

180
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But the other one is constantly in regard to it.

181
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's how the unconditioned.

182
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, it will be.

183
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
When you completely let go of it.

184
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's why the teaching is for the one who feels,

185
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and that's why he teaches only suffering and freedom from it.

186
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And that's it.

187
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's the whole dharma in there.

188
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's only boundless pleasant, because nothing felt.

189
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Or rather, no feeling can touch you.

190
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Thus, you don't feel it.

191
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You don't feel anything.

192
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And that's the extreme.

193
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Like, peace.

194
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So are you going to always see the distinction?

195
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, he won't see it.

196
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He'll feel it.

197
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No, he'll feel it.

198
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He'll feel it.

199
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He'll feel the feeling, and he'll see it from the point of view of perception.

200
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Or rather, he'll, we won't try to see his feeling.

201
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Or will he try to feel these perceptions?

202
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He'll feel, he'll perceive.

203
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Or rather, feeling will feel, perception will perceive.

204
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Intentions will intend.

205
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So you can attend to a feeling, isn't it?

206
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes.

207
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But see, in order to attend to a feeling, you have to, well,

208
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you have to use the proper attention.

209
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Because if you don't know how to attend to the feeling,

210
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
well, you attend by the means that you're used to,

211
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and those are the means of perception,

212
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
you won't be attending to the feeling.

213
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You still feel it.

214
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Because feeling is an aggregates.

215
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You can't not feel it.

216
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You just, you won't be able to discern what feeling is.

217
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You won't be able to know the feeling until you learn how to feel.

218
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So feeling in itself is not enough for you to learn how to feel.

219
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Feeling and just affects you.

220
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Just hits you.

221
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Good and bad when you try.

222
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So by learning how to feel then,

223
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you can eventually transcend the whole,

224
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the whole domain of feeling.

225
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And a lot of demands are missing.

226
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's not hard to pay attention.

227
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not hard to feel.

228
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's not hard to feel.

229
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But I couldn't say that at any given time of your experience

230
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
is how the feeling is present there.

231
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So if I ask you now,

232
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and that's the thing,

233
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
you can discern how to feel because there is

234
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
an implicit knowledge of the feeling.

235
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Or a degree of recognition.

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Maybe it's not to the level of knowledge, but certainly.

237
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If you ask me how do I feel?

238
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, if I ask you how do you feel now,

239
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
you would be able to answer.

240
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Even if you say,

241
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
well, I don't quite know.

242
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It means, okay.

243
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So you feel like there is no like that,

244
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
which means you feel kind of beautiful.

245
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Wearing towards unpleasant,

246
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
because you don't really know it.

247
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So you're bored or whatever.

248
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You know.

249
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But they're not ready to answer.

250
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Even some sort of these words describe that.

251
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Sure.

252
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Sure.

253
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But that doesn't still necessarily mean

254
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
that you have confused the two.

255
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That you've started.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Or rather, you can describe the feeling

257
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
in terms of designation, terms of perception.

258
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But you won't assume that that perception stands for that,

259
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
which you feel at the time when you're describing it.

260
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And that's why you can be mindful of the feeling

261
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
or feelings as they arise respectively.

262
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
At any time, at any place in any situation,

263
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
because they're not directly linked to the actual,

264
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
like particular sort of perceptions and so on.

265
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

266
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They arise as a whole.

267
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Perception, feeling and intention arise together,

268
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
cease together.

269
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So you can,

270
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
when there is a disagreeable perception or whatever,

271
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
that has a reason, for untrained mind,

272
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
they're most likely going to be unpleasant feelings as well.

273
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But that doesn't necessarily have to be the case.

274
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And because it doesn't have to be the case,

275
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
freedom from disagreeable perceptions

276
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
in terms of suffering is possible.

277
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Because if perception perceives and feeling feels,

278
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
there's nothing to do with you.

279
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's a free of the disagreeable perception.

280
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Disagreeable perceptions for protusion mean suffering,

281
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
meaning feeling pain, feeling unpleasant.

282
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Because that mix,

283
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
or rather that mixing up,

284
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
that that wrong assumption in regard to perception

285
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and feeling feeling perception,

286
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
that I will think,

287
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
it's so hardened that now is the solid thing.

288
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So for him, disagreeable means pain.

289
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Disagreeable perceptions,

290
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
discomfort,

291
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and in any of that kind of means emotional pain.

292
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So he needs to kind of,

293
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
unravelled,

294
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the whole thing,

295
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
the whole assumption,

296
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and then start doing exactly that.

297
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because if you can see the difference,

298
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and all the difference between perception and feeling,

299
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that's almost, that's John.

300
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Well, if you get established in that,

301
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
it would be.

302
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So if you can perceive,

303
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
or rather,

304
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
if your experience can let the perceptions

305
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
perceive in feelings feel,

306
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
you become redundant.

307
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And that's John.

308
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
My sense of self becomes redundant,

309
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and disappears.

310
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Temporarily,

311
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
based on the intention of that establishment,

312
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
upon that establishment,

313
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
but with the right view,

314
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
that's all it takes.

315
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Then the view of the self will disappear,

316
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
the views of the conceit,

317
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
will disappear and so on,

318
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and then yeah,

319
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
you will be in a random.

320
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Because perception perceives, feeling feels,

321
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
intention intends.

322
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So this sense of self now,

323
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
the link is in regard,

324
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and kind of hovers over these things,

325
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
you realize, well,

326
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
that's just another perception, isn't it?

327
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The perceives,

328
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
there's feeling in regard to it,

329
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
that feels,

330
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and intention in regard to it,

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
that intends.

332
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Then the subtler sense of why I'm in regard to that,

333
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
oh, well, the fact that I was just able to designate,

334
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
it means that's another perception that perceives,

335
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that has a feeling that in regard to it,

336
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
it feels, and intention that intends.

337
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And you can push this infinitely,

338
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
until you get tired,

339
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and you realize, oh,

340
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
this whole idea,

341
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
this whole notion,

342
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
this whole concept of,

343
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I am lingering,

344
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
is just a more subtle perception,

345
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in regard to the original perception,

346
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
it's a more subtle feeling,

347
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
in regard to the original feeling,

348
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
it's a more subtle intention,

349
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
in regard to the original intention.

350
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's all you're going to have,

351
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
is feel, perception, intention.

352
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And when you,

353
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
kind of drill that,

354
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
long enough,

355
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and in notion of me,

356
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and I am,

357
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
it just fades, evaporates,

358
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
like heating a pan

359
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
that has water in it.

360
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You know,

361
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
if there's a lot of water,

362
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
you might have to heat it longer,

363
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
but eventually,

364
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
everything will evaporate,

365
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and then you can stop heating it.

366
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Here's the heart of St. John, of course.

367
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
By knowing what John is,

368
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
by not mixing your feelings

369
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
with your perceptions,

370
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
by learning how to feel,

371
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
but be mindful of your feelings.

372
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
All of those things

373
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
can become basis for your John.

374
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So, the one state of mind that,

375
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I can see that,

376
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I did most of my things in my life

377
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
was because of boredom,

378
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
most things I did.

379
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Again, you've all this,

380
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
since you've had it,

381
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
you've all been drinking smoking,

382
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
all business watching movies,

383
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and boredom.

384
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I think the most people get,

385
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
yeah, that's the,

386
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
boredom and fear of boredom.

387
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Fear of boredom.

388
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Like genuine fear of boredom.

389
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You know, I'm bored,

390
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
but you actually,

391
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
everybody, what?

392
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Fear of boredom.

393
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Because when you do get extremely,

394
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
extremely boredom,

395
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
that's extremely, extremely boredom.

396
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Well, then you start losing,

397
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
losing your sense of self,

398
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
which is obviously for somebody

399
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
who is all about their sense of self,

400
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
it's very frightening.

401
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So, that's why boredom freak people out,

402
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
because you can lose your sense of self,

403
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
not in there.

404
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, not losing in terms of,

405
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
fully extinguished,

406
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
as another hand,

407
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
but basically start feeling,

408
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
like you're not letting go of the sense of self,

409
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
yet it's being taken away.

410
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, but how is it taking away that?

411
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Well, it's taken away through boredom,

412
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
basically simply because boredom is unpleasant,

413
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
or rather, you've been pursuing,

414
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
everybody's been pursuing pleasures,

415
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
habitually,

416
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and now they became dependent upon the pursuit of pleasures.

417
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Thus, when there are no pleasures,

418
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
even if there is no particular pain,

419
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
so it's just boredom,

420
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
it's just a neutral feeling,

421
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
but because you're so dependent upon pleasures,

422
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
that neutral feeling starts to feel very unpleasant.

423
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And not knowing this cave from unpleasant,

424
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
you fear it even more,

425
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
you're affected by it even more.

426
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So, basically, the whole thing of boredom

427
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
just shows you that deep down,

428
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
inside of your very sense of self

429
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
that you hold very dearly,

430
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
you're not in control,

431
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
even of that.

432
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And that freaks you out.

433
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That's a solitary confinement,

434
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
before I think I'm mad.

435
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And when they come out, they're like,

436
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
oh, it's a different person now.

437
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah, you would be.

438
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Obviously, you know,

439
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
for somebody with the right view,

440
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
solitary confinement would probably result in arranging.

441
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But for those with the other right view,

442
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
even coming across Nibbana,

443
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
it would freak them out,

444
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
as they did in the soup,

445
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and they would understand the goal of Dama

446
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and the Buddha,

447
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
or the Buddha was pointing at us off,

448
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
they would annihilate us,

449
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
they would kill us, they would destroy us.

450
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Because they, their mind,

451
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
their attention is still very rooted

452
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
in that completely gratuitously assumed sense of self,

453
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
but that is real a search,

454
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and that's all they have at a time.

455
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So that's why,

456
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
if in that state of mind,

457
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
they come across anything they will vaguely indicate,

458
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
they are not in control,

459
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
they would be quite a good cause for anxiety,

460
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
for a deep anxiety.

461
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And then if you stay with a deep anxiety longer,

462
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
in the case of prolonged boredom,

463
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
you start freaking out,

464
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
or you start looking for the way out.

465
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Not everybody would freak out,

466
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
some people would say,

467
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
okay, I'm going to look,

468
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
there is a freedom from this,

469
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
because I'm not in control of my own very self.

470
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Now when I say I'm not in control,

471
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I can do anything,

472
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
which is something people end up doing after prolonged boredom.

473
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But means basically,

474
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
you have no say,

475
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
in the very foundations of your own being,

476
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that you take to be yours.

477
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Thus, that's a big contradiction.

478
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
If it's mine,

479
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
well, you would have a say,

480
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
but you have no say.

481
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So how can it be yours?

482
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But you don't know anything,

483
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
but to have it as yours.

484
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But now everything is indicating

485
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
you that it can't be yours.

486
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So you have a choice.

487
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
If you're able to,

488
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
you can then just turn a blind eye

489
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and run even faster

490
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
from the fact that you have no say in it.

491
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And always kind of be just just sort of enough,

492
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
like, you know,

493
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
basically you're drowning,

494
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but you're just enough space

495
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
to have like a breath of air,

496
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
every now and then.

497
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And that's what most people lives are,

498
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
constant pursuit,

499
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
because it's not,

500
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I mean, the types of pursuit

501
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
are optional.

502
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But the reasons for the pursuit

503
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
for people are they are not optional.

504
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They don't have to do it,

505
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
because if you don't do it,

506
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you start thinking.

507
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And where do you think?

508
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You think in the,

509
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
in the basically in the environment

510
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
that shows you that things

511
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
are indifferent to you,

512
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
you have no say,

513
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
in your own feelings,

514
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
in your own intentions,

515
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
in your own perceptions,

516
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
yet you're taken to be yours.

517
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That feels basically you're like,

518
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
in a locked, in a car,

519
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
in a vehicle,

520
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
that it's running down the hill,

521
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
full speed,

522
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and actually the steering wheel

523
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
is not working,

524
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
maybe a little bit,

525
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
but not in a sense

526
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
that you can stop the car.

527
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You turn around.

528
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's a basic road,

529
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
you can choose the way you're going to crash.

530
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But even that,

531
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
it's not ultimately not to you,

532
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
because you might crash

533
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
even before you reach

534
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
where you want to crash it.

535
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So you have,

536
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
you have a limited degree of control

537
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
within the ultimate lack of control.

538
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And where it sounds like suicide is,

539
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
like the acts of suicide,

540
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
you can,

541
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
you don't really

542
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
try to do so.

543
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

544
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Well, that's what I'm going to say,

545
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
if you can only kind of

546
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
aim at the body

547
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and then wait for death to come,

548
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
to come.

549
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And that's,

550
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
that's,

551
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
that's,

552
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
well, that's,

553
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
that's basically,

554
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and even that,

555
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
it's not,

556
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
even that death

557
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that comes cannot be yours.

558
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Any more than any other things

559
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
that you could do during your life

560
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
can be yours.

561
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So one alternative

562
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
is to keep running away

563
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
from the alternative

564
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
is to then recognize

565
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
that this,

566
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
it's not a good deal.

567
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And the contradiction

568
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
that your resistance is.

569
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So I'm,

570
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
here, I am,

571
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I feel things in mind,

572
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
but I'm not saying it.

573
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So then I bet,

574
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I better make the effort

575
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and abandon the notion of

576
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I am,

577
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and things in mind.

578
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So then I won't,

579
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I won't be having to live

580
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
this contradiction,

581
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
which is actually unpleasant.

582
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So being at the bottom

583
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
of extreme boredom

584
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
there is nothing for you

585
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
to do,

586
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
there's nothing for you to have.

587
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, there never was.

588
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There never was,

589
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
there never was.

590
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
There's what it is important.

591
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It feels,

592
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I,

593
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
yeah.

594
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Nonactivity.

595
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Abiding in nonactivity.

596
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But we see, obviously,

597
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
boredom as a designation,

598
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
it's already defined by

599
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
two genus,

600
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and it has a very negative

601
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
connotation, boredom.

602
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And see,

603
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
it has a negative connotation,

604
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
but it also implies

605
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
quite some,

606
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
quite some self-deception

607
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
as well.

608
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Guys, I am bored.

609
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's kind of,

610
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
it's kind of all right,

611
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
but I don't like to be bored,

612
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
but actually boredom is quite serious,

613
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
because you might kind of

614
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
this try to dismiss you

615
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
by saying,

616
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
ah, it's boredom,

617
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
you just bored.

618
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Leaving boredom

619
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
a bit longer,

620
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and then you'll see,

621
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
here's that falling apart.

622
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Everybody is falling apart.

623
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What?

624
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Two genus is falling apart.

625
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah.

626
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But more accurately,

627
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
it's a neutral feeling

628
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
that obviously for

629
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
a general, it's not known,

630
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
it's not understood,

631
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
it's being feared,

632
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
it's boredom.

633
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's insinuct,

634
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
it's wherever else

635
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
that comes out of it.

636
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But if you actually

637
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
recognize it as such,

638
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
say,

639
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
recognize it in regard to,

640
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
like,

641
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
low-lear feelings

642
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
of,

643
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
of sensual pleasure

644
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and sensual discomfort

645
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and so on,

646
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
then you,

647
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
you actually know

648
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
this is peaceful,

649
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
this is more sublime.

650
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's,

651
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
it's peaceful,

652
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
it's neutral.

653
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And it's quite pleasant.

654
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
In order to find

655
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
a pleasant,

656
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
you need to elevate your mind

657
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
to that level.

658
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You need to train

659
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
in regard to it.

660
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because the mind starts

661
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
down in the gutter,

662
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
always,

663
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
just a different extent.

664
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And then you have to work

665
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
your way up.

666
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yeah,

667
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
we're,

668
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
we're,

669
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
we're in somebody's

670
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
bored,

671
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
negative sense of boredom.

672
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The mind starts to,

673
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
yeah,

674
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
you can't,

675
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and you start craving,

676
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
even craving those

677
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
old sentences.

678
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

679
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

680
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

681
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Because basically,

682
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that office itself,

683
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but that,

684
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
you spoke before,

685
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the sensual pleasure,

686
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
kind of feels like a,

687
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
like a quick fix,

688
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
whereby,

689
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
not just that you,

690
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
not just that you get the

691
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
pleasure of the sense

692
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
that you're engaging in,

693
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
but you also get the pleasure

694
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
of just kind of avoiding

695
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
this boring pain,

696
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
this heavy,

697
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
anxious threat.

698
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Behind this boredom.

699
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So the pleasure,

700
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
makes that disappear,

701
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
seemingly,

702
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
improvise you with a pleasure

703
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
on top of it.

704
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So it's like a double whammy.

705
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But,

706
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
yeah,

707
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the issue,

708
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
if you don't go

709
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
into sensual pleasures,

710
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
you just crave for them.

711
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Is this

712
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
double the suffering

713
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
right there, you know?

714
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah.

715
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Because you're not,

716
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
you know,

717
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
you're bored.

718
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Initially,

719
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
absolutely craving.

720
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

721
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So you crave.

722
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So,

723
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
so you suffer on a kind of

724
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
boredom,

725
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
because you're ignorant

726
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
in regard to it,

727
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and then you suffer on a kind of

728
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
uncontrollable craving,

729
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that you are not,

730
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
kind of, covering up

731
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
through giving in to that craving.

732
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So you have a double,

733
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
double suffering that has been present,

734
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and that's exactly how it is.

735
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It has to be in the beginning.

736
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
That's why,

737
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Vinaya,

738
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
the Sila,

739
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
has to come first.

740
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The restraint,

741
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
the presets,

742
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
has to come first.

743
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's not a dharma,

744
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
but there wouldn't be any dharma

745
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
without it.

746
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So it has to come first,

747
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and then you can start building

748
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
within that.

749
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Vinaya,

750
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you can see craving.

751
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's ugly.

752
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Craving,

753
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
equals suffering.

754
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You were craving

755
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
for this boredom to be

756
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
absent,

757
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
to be not present.

758
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You were craving for pleasure

759
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
to be present.

760
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You have craving

761
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
on both levels.

762
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You have suffering on both levels.

763
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And you don't suffer,

764
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
actually.

765
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You don't suffer

766
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
because you're not pursuing

767
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
your desires.

768
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's that non-pursuitive desires

769
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
shows you the craving

770
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
behind them,

771
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
which is why you suffer.

772
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But it takes time to discern that,

773
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
because craving,

774
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you give in,

775
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
you go after a desire,

776
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and pain disappears.

777
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Or so it seems.

778
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Well, the pain disappears

779
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
because you stop craving.

780
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And you stop craving

781
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
because you have the assumption

782
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
that you've satisfied your desire.

783
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But the assumption

784
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
is nothing to do with the actual

785
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
satisfaction of your senses

786
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
or not.

787
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's just an assumption,

788
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
which is why next time,

789
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
you probably need more of it.

790
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And more of it.

791
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And harder scratch.

792
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And harder push

793
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and so on.

794
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And for what?

795
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
For the same assumption of,

796
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
okay, now I'm fine.

797
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But we might feel

798
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
at ease temporarily.

799
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So craving disappears.

800
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And then suffering disappears.

801
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But you think suffering disappears

802
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
because you said this

803
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
when you desire.

804
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But you didn't,

805
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
because when craving comes back,

806
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and it always comes back,

807
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
because it's not distinguished,

808
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
suffering appears.

809
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And then again,

810
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
you don't blame the craving

811
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
for that suffering,

812
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
you blame,

813
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
oh, it's a new desire

814
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and you need to satisfy.

815
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But it's actually,

816
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
if there is a presence of craving,

817
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
means suffering is present.

818
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You cannot suffer,

819
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
on any other account,

820
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
except one single account,

821
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
presence of craving.

822
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
In regard to the most extreme circumstances,

823
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
the most extreme discomfort,

824
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
situations, experiences,

825
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
if there is suffering present,

826
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
it's not because of them.

827
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's because of the presence of craving

828
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
in regard to those circumstances.

829
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So that's why people are

830
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
restrained for people in Spain.

831
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And they think,

832
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm hurting now,

833
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
because I'm holding myself back.

834
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm hurting because I'm restrained.

835
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
No,

836
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
it's not,

837
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
it basically restrained

838
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
is a sighting whereby,

839
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
if you engage in restraint,

840
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
what is revealed

841
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
is that craving

842
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
is suffering.

843
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Nothing else.

844
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But in order to see that,

845
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
you have to stop,

846
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
you have to practice restraints efficiently

847
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
for you to know

848
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
that you should stop blaming it

849
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
for pain.

850
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Stop assuming that

851
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
is the reason for your pain.

852
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah.

853
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah.

854
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So the sensuality

855
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
in itself

856
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
is inseparable from craving.

857
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So the perceptions of sensuality

858
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
are inseparable from craving.

859
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
They imply craving.

860
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Thus,

861
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
you're perceiving

862
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
sensual desire,

863
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
means craving is present,

864
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
means suffering is present.

865
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Now, you restraining yourself

866
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
in regard to the pursuit

867
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
of the sensual desire,

868
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
pain arises immediately

869
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
through saying no to yourself.

870
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But that pain is not because you said no.

871
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
That pain is because,

872
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
saying no to yourself

873
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
revealed the underlying setup

874
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
of presence of craving

875
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
is very painful.

876
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And that pain,

877
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
how can you deal with it?

878
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Either by extinguishing craving,

879
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
which is for most people,

880
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
well, impossible.

881
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
They simply don't know

882
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
how

883
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
have not been instructed,

884
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
have not heard it,

885
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
they have no concept of it.

886
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So the only way,

887
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
like, it's not really escape,

888
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
but the only way

889
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
they could approximate

890
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
escape would be given in.

891
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And then again,

892
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
happens exactly what I said before.

893
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Oh,

894
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
not just that you

895
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
kind of obscured

896
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
the pain that has arisen,

897
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
but now you also

898
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
got the pleasure of the senses.

899
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So you kind of feel

900
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
although it is good.

901
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yeah, I avoided the pain

902
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
and I got pleasure as a result

903
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
through it.

904
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Well, that's,

905
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you can't ask for more.

906
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
But the problem is,

907
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
the underlying setup

908
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
of presence of craving,

909
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
presence of suffering,

910
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
not just that he hasn't been

911
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
affected or resolved,

912
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
he just has been fortified more.

913
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So the more you

914
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
pursue desires,

915
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
the more you crave,

916
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
which means the more

917
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the more the craving is present,

918
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the more the suffering is present.

919
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Hence the similarly

920
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
of scratching the edge,

921
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
you get that relief

922
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
temporarily while you're scratching it,

923
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
overall you're making it

924
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
much, much worse.

925
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Next time it's

926
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
scratch harder,

927
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and harder,

928
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
and harder,

929
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
until eventually,

930
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
you're just like a

931
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
mangy doll

932
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
that's not even aware of it,

933
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
but it's perpetually,

934
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
perpetually just scratching

935
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and wrapping its skin open.

936
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It doesn't even know it anymore,

937
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
it's just doing it as I have it,

938
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
it's just scratch,

939
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
it's just,

940
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
mind is elsewhere,

941
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and he's just ripping it,

942
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
just scratching it.

943
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And that's,

944
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
you know, quite, quite, quite formally,

945
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
human existence.

946
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Expect a burden in this.

947
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It feels like,

948
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
yeah, he's done,

949
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
isn't it?

950
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah.

951
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
When there's nothing to

952
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
be happening.

953
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You feel like,

954
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
you feel like you're

955
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
being annihilated.

956
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Gradually.

957
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Let me quote a pleasant thing,

958
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
isn't it?

959
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Once you start having it.

960
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
If you're not holding on

961
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
to the contradiction of

962
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I am,

963
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
while that I am

964
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
being annihilated,

965
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
that's a discrepancy.

966
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So you avoid,

967
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
you overcome that discrepancy,

968
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
well,

969
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
by basically not holding

970
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
on to I am anymore.

971
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So then there won't be any discrepancy.

972
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Splitting,

973
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
hurting you,

974
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
annihilating you.

975
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Scroplism.

976
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
We're here.

977
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's deliberation.

978
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Okay, that's okay.

979
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
As a,

980
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
in a monastic life.

981
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Let me just give some practice

982
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
to cross,

983
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
they're calling me.

984
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You know what I'm doing?

985
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I better turn my back.

986
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Nice.

987
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Go on, sorry.

988
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah, in monastic life.

989
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You come and crop well.

990
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I came across a plot anyway.

991
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
What ethics do you embody?

992
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And then just constant thoughts of,

993
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
you're dying.

994
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And then ideas of how to survive.

995
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Try, you know,

996
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
you might go back to the past.

997
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Try to rekindle yourself.

998
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
We try to rekindle yourself.

999
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
We can't do this.

1000
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah.

1001
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
What about this?

1002
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Don't, you know,

1003
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
don't lose yourself.

1004
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Kind of.

1005
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That desperate.

1006
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah, there's desperation.

1007
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
To survive.

1008
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Yeah.

1009
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Or that's self.

1010
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
All of our things around the memories,

1011
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
around the thoughts,

1012
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
there were dear,

1013
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
there were significant,

1014
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
through the sense of self.

1015
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Because if I had to be bored,

1016
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm sure that we can't be in,

1017
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
that desperate,

1018
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
attempt to survive.

1019
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But being able to watch,

1020
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
be able to be.

1021
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Being able to not act out of it.

1022
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
To not.

1023
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Well, to not act out of fear of boredom.

1024
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Not act out of fear.

1025
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
We'll stop.

1026
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So to allow that boredom and that fear to arise.

1027
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah.

1028
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And just sit through it.

1029
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Kind of watch it.

1030
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah.

1031
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
If something happens,

1032
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
then there's nothing to do

1033
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
with your intention to run away from it.

1034
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But if something happens,

1035
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm just watching a mosquito trying to enter through the curtain.

1036
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah, sure.

1037
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
If something happens,

1038
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
while you're being bored.

1039
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
But if that happens,

1040
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
if another is out of you,

1041
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
trying to run away,

1042
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
trying to, you know,

1043
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
cover up the boredom,

1044
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
that's fine.

1045
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Well, long be fine,

1046
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
is hoping for something to happen.

1047
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Well, long be fine,

1048
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
is rejecting that which happened

1049
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
because you must be bored.

1050
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah.

1051
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But that all comes

1052
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
through training in boredom.

1053
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You'll be able to start discerning it.

1054
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Turn on the distraction.

1055
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Through restraint.

1056
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Through restraint.

1057
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yes.

1058
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And then it will come.

1059
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And the more it comes,

1060
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the more proficient it is to become.

1061
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The more proficient it is,

1062
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
the more it is better you see it.

1063
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And then, oh,

1064
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
this is training in peace.

1065
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
With some of this, yeah.

1066
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Some of this is not doing anything just sitting around.

1067
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It doesn't mess it, doesn't it?

1068
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Well, externally,

1069
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
they might be just sitting around internally.

1070
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
They are probably doing a lot of wrong things.

1071
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:48,000
For wrong reasons.

1072
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Here is the mind,

1073
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
this goes off into all sorts of directions.

1074
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And usually when you sit down,

1075
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
they are not doing anything,

1076
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
they tend to them not doing work.

1077
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But they are sitting around,

1078
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
they are doing things they want to do,

1079
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
which means they are not necessarily bored.

1080
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
They are sitting around.

1081
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Well, nobody likes boredom.

1082
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Well, I don't like it.

1083
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I don't like boredom.

1084
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So, I don't want to appreciate it,

1085
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
because you can make me do that.

1086
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I put a gym in the field, is it?

1087
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Because you can kill him.

1088
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Well, because he doesn't know how to let go of his head

1089
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
himself,

1090
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and that creates a rather unbearable discrepancy.

1091
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And all into this,

1092
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
which now,

1093
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
it's kind of obvious,

1094
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
cannot be mine yet,

1095
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I cannot not hold onto it.

1096
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So, it really feels like you're being kind of,

1097
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
a coach on the inside.

1098
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And yet, people lose their minds often.

1099
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And I can't hold it.

1100
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Just get depressed.

1101
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
We'll get rid of it in the first, yeah.

1102
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Catatonic nap.

1103
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah.

1104
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Because it always seemed like something was wrong,

1105
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
isn't it?

1106
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
We let that boredom make it wrong.

1107
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
That's again,

1108
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
there's just a view coming from the point of view of sense itself,

1109
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
so it's used to.

1110
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Yeah.

1111
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Instead of doing that,

1112
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
all those, those, those,

1113
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
kind of collector reviews

1114
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:39,000
would also start fading.
