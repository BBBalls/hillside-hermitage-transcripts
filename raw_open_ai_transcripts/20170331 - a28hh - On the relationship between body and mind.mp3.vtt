WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.120
Yes, the other day you were talking about experience, you used the example of experiences

00:08.120 --> 00:15.080
looking, experiences like looking into the mirror, remember you were explaining, it's

00:15.080 --> 00:20.280
like a mirror, it's like a mirror, and that.

00:20.280 --> 00:32.360
Well, I do remember the context, no, I forgot the context, it's basically about, ah, no,

00:32.360 --> 00:37.600
not like a mirror, but more, okay, yes, like a mirror, like you can't see or access from

00:37.600 --> 00:46.240
directly, but you can recognize, or you can experience is the appearance of it, which

00:46.240 --> 00:52.680
is basically, ah, like a mirror image of that, which is mirrored, but you can only, whatever

00:52.680 --> 00:57.280
you look, it will be looking at that mirror, in other words, you can't look away from

00:57.280 --> 01:02.320
the mirror, or from that reflection, and see the thing that's been reflected, all you

01:02.320 --> 01:06.120
can get is the reflected of the matter.

01:06.120 --> 01:10.920
So your number, it's basically the reflect, as the only thing that sort of arises, it's

01:10.920 --> 01:17.240
the old, the old, ah, the, the reason thing, ah, basically that's because of which, sorry,

01:17.240 --> 01:21.320
matter is that, because of which this number will arise, which means, it's because of

01:21.320 --> 01:27.480
that matter, but see, when you say that matter, that already belongs to that, that designation

01:27.480 --> 01:31.640
belongs to that number, which means it belongs to that, ah, reflected image.

01:31.640 --> 01:39.640
So you all, the only way to, to, to know, ah, that, ah, matter is there, is to discern,

01:39.640 --> 01:45.480
so you can't see through the senses, it doesn't appear directly, so basically by fully understanding

01:45.480 --> 01:52.320
number, you then discern, the number, it's because of that, which does not appear, but

01:52.320 --> 01:59.720
it's there, as a necessary condition, what appears, that which appears, if anything ever

01:59.720 --> 02:02.920
appears, it will appear within number, which means, there's the only way to appear,

02:02.920 --> 02:07.160
which means that's what appears and sees, ah, but then appearance will not be there, if

02:07.160 --> 02:12.640
there is no matter, to support the appearance, but you can never see the matter, even when

02:12.640 --> 02:16.600
you think about the matter, you think within the realm of designation, which means, you're

02:16.600 --> 02:23.600
thinking is part of that number, but when that's, that one, so it says, ah, as it's about

02:23.600 --> 02:28.440
conceitings, whatever you conceit, it's always other than that, ah, yeah, whatever it is,

02:28.440 --> 02:34.680
but, but, I, I think that Suta, if I remember correctly the context, he was just, ah, just,

02:34.680 --> 02:38.760
he wasn't dealing with these, on the subtle level, these things, he was just basically

02:38.760 --> 02:43.720
saying that, whatever protusion conceives, things end up being differently, but you could

02:43.720 --> 02:50.000
say, what I haven't had, but conceiving, in itself, basically, like, monoperas, it's

02:50.000 --> 02:55.520
already, ah, well, it's already the form of distortion, no matter how subtle the conceiving

02:55.520 --> 03:03.480
is, and that's exactly the point, you conceive, there you go, you have the matter, and then

03:03.480 --> 03:08.240
you have the appeared, well, you have the appearance of the matter, that's what you have,

03:08.240 --> 03:13.640
based on that, you can discern that that appearance, is obviously the appearance of that matter,

03:13.640 --> 03:19.240
but even saying that that matter, that actually, it's part of that appearance, that designation,

03:19.240 --> 03:26.280
so you can't go beyond the appearance, or, or science, like, look sideways, and then

03:26.280 --> 03:34.600
find that, which is the, the, the, the cause for that appearance, because it would, the only

03:34.600 --> 03:38.560
way to know that there is matter behind appearance is, because of that, which appears, so the

03:38.560 --> 03:45.320
matter can never be accessed directly, as appearance can, so you're going to have this appearance,

03:45.320 --> 03:50.040
well, whatever you think about matter, and that's the thing, that's monoperas, so basically,

03:50.040 --> 03:56.600
it's that appearance, that you then conceive to be that matter, you conceive it to be in

03:56.600 --> 04:01.040
that matter, you conceive it to be out of that matter, you, in other words, you conceive

04:01.040 --> 04:07.040
the matter, through not understanding appearance, see, the fact that, like, if you, if you were to,

04:07.040 --> 04:13.640
if you were to, if you were to assume that this appearance is in the matter, you fail to

04:13.640 --> 04:20.520
see that that thought in the matter is already part of that appearance, but no, you, you don't,

04:20.520 --> 04:25.120
you don't take it like that, you take it to stand for that, which that matter is, because

04:25.120 --> 04:33.960
of which this appearance is, so many to replay this, and it's your time, but basically,

04:33.960 --> 04:42.440
it's, it's quite essential, or you conceive to be out, or in and out, or both, or to be

04:42.440 --> 04:47.760
mine, or whatever, whatever permutation you can do, any of those things, it's irrelevant

04:47.760 --> 04:54.040
whether you conceive it in or out, to be mine, to be for me, to be I am, the point is,

04:54.040 --> 04:57.600
you're conceiving relationship, and if you're conceiving relationship, you are putting

04:57.600 --> 05:03.520
the appearance, and the matter, because of which appearance is, you are putting them on

05:03.520 --> 05:10.040
the same footing, you, you, by comparing them, by relating them, not necessarily comparing

05:10.040 --> 05:20.360
them, but by relating them, you are basically conceiving the matter, because even that thought

05:20.360 --> 05:25.280
of, oh, this is from the matter, it's apart from the matter, it's in the matter, it's

05:25.280 --> 05:31.800
out of the matter, it's because of the matter, that thought of that matter, it's part of

05:31.800 --> 05:38.480
that appearance, but you take it to stand for the matter because of which appearance is,

05:38.480 --> 05:43.440
because you conceiving, you gave it life that it doesn't actually have, you gave it being

05:43.440 --> 05:57.040
that it doesn't have, thus you made it exist, just through that, but if you thoroughly understand

05:57.040 --> 06:06.240
appearance, as again, the illustration I gave of the mirror in front of you, and the thing

06:06.240 --> 06:11.200
that appears is behind you, it's obviously not perfect, because in the long as a sumic

06:11.200 --> 06:15.400
you can just turn your head, but you can't, in this case you can't turn your head or look

06:15.400 --> 06:19.400
somewhere where you will access that matter, because all you can ever access will be the

06:19.400 --> 06:25.240
appearance, because that's what appears, that's what accessing is, which, which that means

06:25.240 --> 06:30.800
that this matter is always below your feet, always, and fully discerning that will make you

06:30.800 --> 06:36.200
then completely relinquish any notion of belonging in regards to anything that appears,

06:36.200 --> 06:42.560
and what do you pick, everything appears, five only it's appeared, the nature is to appear,

06:42.560 --> 06:46.480
disappear and persist or change, so you abandon the whole thing, through seeing that it's

06:46.480 --> 06:51.400
fully undermined by the four great elements, for example, in this example, and they can

06:51.400 --> 06:56.240
never, you can never access the four great elements, yet your entire life, your entire existence

06:56.240 --> 07:01.480
is big, it's like directly found in the pond and even you think, oh I can't access the

07:01.480 --> 07:04.640
four great elements, you can be conceiving the four great elements, if you think that

07:04.640 --> 07:08.720
thought stands for that which four great elements is, but it can't stand because that thought

07:08.720 --> 07:14.640
has appeared, thus it's part of the appearance, but the discernment can pertain, the knowledge

07:14.640 --> 07:19.720
can be directed towards that which does not appear, but it's the ultimate determination

07:19.720 --> 07:25.280
of your entire experience as a whole, so you can discern, and that's just basically

07:25.280 --> 07:31.160
changing the direction, so you never arrive at that because of which this appearance is,

07:31.160 --> 07:36.400
because that will make it appear, but you just change the direction, instead of for me

07:36.400 --> 07:46.280
it's opposite, it's not for me, it comes from elsewhere, and that's enough for dispassion,

07:46.280 --> 07:56.320
so any appearance, any experience, yeah it's not for me, so it's the opposite or for me

07:56.320 --> 08:00.640
like towards you, it's the rises for you, whether it take you to leave it, it's up to you

08:00.640 --> 08:06.680
but it's for you, my eyes, my sights, it's all for me, it's mine, well now you take

08:06.680 --> 08:11.360
it completely against that direction, you go the other way, it's not for you, it arises

08:11.360 --> 08:16.800
from that which you cannot even conceive in your thoughts, you can't think of it, but

08:16.800 --> 08:20.920
it is that because of which, and see even when I'm talking about it like this, that's

08:20.920 --> 08:27.440
obviously the limits of the designation, you are talking about it, like you know, like

08:27.440 --> 08:33.040
I said, oh it's inexpressible, but I just expressed it, and this is the nature of designation,

08:33.040 --> 08:37.640
so you should not mystify that because of which your appearance is, you should discern

08:37.640 --> 08:46.200
it, and the Buddha said, when the four great elements change, and the four great elements

08:46.200 --> 08:54.680
they find the footing in your experience through your concealings, through the consciousness

08:54.680 --> 09:00.840
because if I think about earth, yes, that's all you can do about it, but by recognizing

09:00.840 --> 09:05.400
that the appearance is all you have, it will make you stop assuming that you can actually

09:05.400 --> 09:10.440
access the great elements, or access anything so to speak, you can't even access the five

09:10.440 --> 09:16.720
other gates because if you were able to access them in that sense, you would be their owner,

09:16.720 --> 09:22.800
but you are not, you can't be, so you're just constantly maintaining that assumption

09:22.800 --> 09:27.240
that basically feeds the conceivings, and it's because of the conceivings, you just maintain

09:27.240 --> 09:33.840
the vicious circle that's completely different, actually, it's unnecessary in any shape form.

09:33.840 --> 09:39.800
So the recognition of the five other gates, as being inaccessible to you, means okay,

09:39.800 --> 09:44.160
you change the direction, they're not for you anymore because you can't, you can't uphold

09:44.160 --> 09:50.080
them, you can't, you're not in their control, and they're not in your control because they

09:50.080 --> 09:58.400
are determined by that, which you can't even think, let alone see, taste, the touch,

09:58.400 --> 10:04.200
completely behind you, completely underneath, below your feet, you are the reason for, you

10:04.200 --> 10:09.000
are sorry, you are the result, the result of them, yeah, you can say that, you're the

10:09.000 --> 10:14.560
simultaneous presence, your whole life, the simultaneous presence of that means these

10:14.560 --> 10:18.280
things are present because I'm still alive, because my aggregates are still there, means

10:18.280 --> 10:23.640
the elements are still there, the consciousness in regard to them is still there, but all

10:23.640 --> 10:27.840
of that is indirect to you, what you have direct in front of you is Nama in regard to

10:27.840 --> 10:37.160
Lupa, and that's it, and what about the famous, this body and name and form externally,

10:37.160 --> 10:42.640
the around experiences, yeah, that's slightly, slightly different, different approach from

10:42.640 --> 10:51.520
this, but if you were to remove all the assumptions, all the conceivings, and you recognize that

10:51.520 --> 11:00.000
this very body, that you, well, the appearance of this very body is comprised of those four

11:00.000 --> 11:07.560
great elements, and the four great elements can be discerned in regard to that appearance,

11:07.560 --> 11:12.080
and that's absolutely fine, as long as you don't start, well, there wouldn't be a discernment,

11:12.080 --> 11:16.920
basically, as long as you don't start then regarding the discernment, as that, those elements

11:16.920 --> 11:21.720
because of which this body is, because the discernment of the elements, the four great elements,

11:21.720 --> 11:25.040
and the appearance of the body as a result of the four great elements, they're both appearance,

11:25.040 --> 11:29.080
they're on the level of appearance, they share the nature of appearance, they're on different

11:29.080 --> 11:32.760
level of generality, obviously, the body is particular manifestation, the four great elements

11:32.760 --> 11:37.960
and notions of four great elements, but they can accurately stand for the four great elements

11:37.960 --> 11:42.400
if you don't conceive four great elements through those notions, that was in relation

11:42.400 --> 11:46.520
to the other talk we spoke recently about the abstraction, when things cease to be abstract,

11:46.520 --> 11:51.720
they stand for that which they are, and your thought will stand for that element, will

11:51.720 --> 11:56.280
be an accurate representation, because that's all it can be, a representation of four great

11:56.280 --> 12:03.040
elements of a great element, when it doesn't conceal the element through that, so for an

12:03.040 --> 12:08.400
argument with three from conceivings, all that is left is this conscious body here, this

12:08.400 --> 12:13.760
matter paired with consciousness externally, and all the name and forms externally, all

12:13.760 --> 12:20.520
the things that arise, name and form, basically all of the appearance externally, in other

12:20.520 --> 12:25.320
words, the direction of internal mind towards me has changed and now it's all external,

12:25.320 --> 12:29.720
even your utmost personal thoughts, it's just the external appearance, this conscious

12:29.720 --> 12:35.600
point, means basically the arrangement of the consciousness and the elements, it's still

12:35.600 --> 12:42.840
operating, the arrangement that you can't just, you can't even conceive anymore, on a higher

12:42.840 --> 12:52.080
structure, well not on a higher or on a probably more, on a deeper, below your feet, on

12:52.080 --> 12:58.000
your ground, underneath your ground, well in a way it's more general, but no more general

12:58.000 --> 13:09.040
to pertain to things that would appear more generally, it's more immediate, and the way

13:09.040 --> 13:13.320
it appears, this conscious body, when it appears as a thought, that thought doesn't conceive

13:13.320 --> 13:17.520
it to be, that conscious body to be in, that conscious body, from the conscious body,

13:17.520 --> 13:23.040
apart from or for me or mine, it doesn't conceive, it doesn't conceive, you just have a thought

13:23.040 --> 13:26.800
as a mirror representation of the conscious body present, because of which you can still

13:26.800 --> 13:33.160
descend to the conscious body's present day, because of conscious body still present day,

13:33.160 --> 13:40.240
and all of the appearance in regard to it, that's external to you, well not even to you

13:40.240 --> 13:44.000
anymore, because that would imply a certain relationship, all this external to me which

13:44.000 --> 13:49.680
could imply internal, no it's just external, internal becomes external, just less external

13:49.680 --> 13:57.800
than external external, because internal is usually mine, dear, appropriated, so that

13:57.800 --> 14:04.600
internal dimension of putugina stays, it's just not seen as external, and think that

14:04.600 --> 14:26.320
we're external, we're seen as externally external, because we're talking about today

14:26.320 --> 14:33.080
about putting the structure, by the existence, into the right order, so we're talking

14:33.080 --> 14:37.640
when the structure is in the right order, the structure is in the structure, you just

14:37.640 --> 14:44.400
stop conceiving the wrong order, over on top of the existing order of the structure,

14:44.400 --> 14:51.920
and that's doing the same, that's what, well yeah in a way that means not conceiving basically,

14:51.920 --> 14:59.160
because the order of things, yeah, well let's put aside the four great elements, because

14:59.160 --> 15:07.680
that might be the subtle, but back onto the conscious body, right here, the senses, so

15:07.680 --> 15:14.600
you can, as I was telling you today, you can actually touch your eyeball, yeah, close

15:14.600 --> 15:20.520
your eyelids, and you can feel the shape, you can feel everything, and it is that flesh

15:20.520 --> 15:26.800
that you're touching, that bowl, that you're touching, with your fingers, that is that

15:26.800 --> 15:36.720
because of which, there is a whole life of vision, of sights, things you see, desired

15:36.720 --> 15:41.600
and lost in regard to them, fear in regard to things you see, grief in regard to things

15:41.600 --> 15:46.240
you see, anything basically, the whole world in regard to things you see, and same goes

15:46.240 --> 15:55.440
for every sense, yet if you were to touch an apple that had to torch your eyeball, it's

15:55.440 --> 16:01.480
all, it's all shares in nature, it's all material, but it's this particular matter that

16:01.480 --> 16:06.800
pertains to your body, then it's also paired with consciousness, and obviously you can't

16:06.800 --> 16:10.640
see that consciousness, it's just the fact that you can discern that it's paired with

16:10.640 --> 16:16.040
consciousness because you see as a result of that flesh yeah, you don't see as a result

16:16.040 --> 16:21.960
of an apple or a cup or a table, you see as a result of this eye, so that's the only

16:21.960 --> 16:28.760
difference, is the particular arrangement of that matter enables you to see the forms

16:28.760 --> 16:35.720
because the consciousness is there with it, but you, there is no further, like you can't

16:35.720 --> 16:40.000
take this to further to greater analysis to explain because as I said consciousness

16:40.000 --> 16:44.840
doesn't appear, so you can talk about it but most likely you end up conceiving it, you

16:44.840 --> 16:51.200
end up giving it that which doesn't have, but what you can do is recognize that it's

16:51.200 --> 16:57.280
only the passion in regard to eye and forms, lastly in regard to eye and forms, heal well

16:57.280 --> 17:02.240
in regard to eye and forms, delusion in regard, that's only matters, so you have to do,

17:02.240 --> 17:08.600
it's fine with regard, you stop giving possibility for last to arise in regard to eye and forms,

17:08.600 --> 17:12.720
and that's it, when the last is removed then that's all it needs to be done, then what

17:12.720 --> 17:18.720
is left is this conscious body, this fleshy eye, this fleshy nose, this fleshy tongue, there

17:18.720 --> 17:24.240
is still out there below my feet with consciousness, and I know that because things still appear

17:24.240 --> 17:52.560
for me, thus when those aggregates break apart that's it,

17:52.560 --> 18:05.080
to be mindful of the, that which doesn't appear yet is the basis of your appearance, well

18:05.080 --> 18:09.600
no you couldn't be mindful of that which doesn't appear, you can be mindful of the appearance

18:09.600 --> 18:15.720
in regard to that because of which appearance is, and the more accurately mindful you are,

18:15.720 --> 18:24.200
as conceiving as a present, but that which doesn't appear, well you just made it appear

18:24.200 --> 18:30.600
through the statement, it is that which doesn't appear, and that's fine, you can't have

18:30.600 --> 18:37.160
a state, you can't have a designation, you can't have Nama in regard to root by C conceivable,

18:37.160 --> 18:43.160
and that's for people expect to access Rupa, or they assume that they have access to Rupa,

18:43.160 --> 18:48.640
and then my Nama is kind of optional, no it's not, Nama Rupa, Rupa is revealed through

18:48.640 --> 18:56.240
the designation of Nama, that's why it's inseparable, Nama Rupa, so that revelation

18:56.240 --> 19:04.360
is very inaccurate, it's conceived, so all you have to do is sort of make it accurate,

19:04.360 --> 19:10.840
stop conceiving it, purified, but only when I have the Nama Rupa, as the way I said,

19:10.840 --> 19:14.960
this conscious body, a name and form externally, that's what's left for the Nama, so even

19:14.960 --> 19:19.400
other end doesn't remove name in regard to form, or doesn't access form in the name forms

19:19.400 --> 19:29.880
of, it's name and form, it's just discerning properly, through that name, you can then remove

19:29.880 --> 19:40.600
the footing for the form in terms of conceivable, so you can liberate yourself, so mindfulness

19:40.600 --> 19:46.440
in the, let's say mindfulness of the body, and when you think, when you have a thought

19:46.440 --> 19:51.280
of mindfulness of the body, you're not actually directly mindful of those four great elements,

19:51.280 --> 19:57.280
because you can access them, if you're mindful of their appearance, or rather you're mindful

19:57.280 --> 20:01.680
of appearance, because that's what appearance is, it's not their appearance, the appearance

20:01.680 --> 20:05.120
is, and the appearance is because the four great elements are still there standing,

20:05.120 --> 20:11.280
is that the body that should be noticed in the sake of the time now, that's, which,

20:11.280 --> 20:12.280
what do you mean that?

20:12.280 --> 20:14.720
Well, that's what you've got to understand, that's what, that's what the body that you

20:14.720 --> 20:22.120
want to see, we might love it, is the body that appeared, if you're properly mindful,

20:22.120 --> 20:26.280
you'll, you'll, you'll understand mindfulness, you'll understand appearance, you would stop

20:26.280 --> 20:33.440
conceiving, but if you, even through a practice of mindfulness, still think that this is that

20:33.440 --> 20:38.520
the body, no, it's comprised of the four great elements, means the appearance, it's made

20:38.520 --> 20:43.560
of it, but that's all you have, but the mindfulness, if you start being mindful correctly, it's

20:43.560 --> 20:50.640
not mine, not for me, not I am, because that's it, as I said, you come to mindful of the actual

20:50.640 --> 20:56.760
elements behind the body, or underneath it, but you can disown the body, which then will

20:56.760 --> 21:01.200
become an accurate representation of the four great elements, and their ultimate nature

21:01.200 --> 21:07.680
is, they're not yours, they cannot be yours, they're not even possible to be yours, so

21:07.680 --> 21:13.120
you start emulating that in regard to appearance, and eventually it will, it will stand for, for

21:13.120 --> 21:19.200
how things actually are, which means you've been around, then you can't undo it, so as

21:19.200 --> 21:24.800
proper mindfulness has to be paired with that knowledge, absolutely, right view comes

21:24.800 --> 21:31.320
first, even the mindful, this cannot be the right one, there's no right view, no matter

21:31.320 --> 21:39.880
how general that mindfulness is, the right view always comes first, which is why any

21:39.880 --> 21:58.000
makes everything else right, then upon it, it's like this in the Anapanasati Sutra, there's

21:58.000 --> 22:05.820
one section in the beginning, it's always translated, calming the bodily formation, what is the

22:05.820 --> 22:19.920
bodily formation, the breath, breathing, Anapanasati Sutra, Kainasankara, here, while breathing

22:19.920 --> 22:24.280
in the experiences, the whole body, or the whole breath, there are people that have the

22:24.280 --> 22:29.720
breath of the body, but the experiences while breathing, the whole body, and then the

22:29.720 --> 22:39.000
next sentence says, while breathing, you have to, he breathes calming, the body formation,

22:39.000 --> 22:50.000
now if the body formation is breathing, he could have said calming the breath, well, he

22:50.000 --> 22:54.400
could have said that, but then he wouldn't be seen as Sankara, he wouldn't serve for

22:54.400 --> 23:00.680
a student, recognition and cultivation of the simultaneous principle of Sankara and Sankara

23:00.680 --> 23:04.640
to them, and that's the whole point, full understanding of the principle means our

23:04.640 --> 23:10.160
energy, but if he just says, he just can't be breath, you won't be seen, but he depended

23:10.160 --> 23:20.360
upon the action of breathing, that's the point, the point, you take on mindfully an act

23:20.360 --> 23:28.920
of breathing, in the same sense, the will turn, turns the will like this, turns the will

23:28.920 --> 23:32.800
like that, you breathe in like this, you breathe, it's not that you're trying to control it,

23:32.800 --> 23:41.220
in terms of stock it, or force it, the breathing is there, but you kind of, like, imagine

23:41.220 --> 23:46.840
the horses that are already running, but then you join in and you take the reins, but

23:46.840 --> 23:50.960
you don't interfere with the running, but you do take the reins, and you might slow it

23:50.960 --> 23:54.880
down or something, but there's still going the direction and you're not changing that,

23:54.880 --> 24:00.320
so you take on the mindfully an act of breathing, and then you can influence through the existing

24:00.320 --> 24:04.680
act of breathing, you can okay, along the breath, short and the breath, the point is you're

24:04.680 --> 24:10.400
mindful of the breathing, that experience being mindful of the breathing, because breathing

24:10.400 --> 24:15.800
is bodily, it's bound with a body, it's inseparable, it's inconceivable, so even just the thought

24:15.800 --> 24:21.120
of breathing already implies the experience of the body, it's in there, so when you're

24:21.120 --> 24:26.000
thinking about breathing, when you're breathing, through that you're already imploring a form

24:26.000 --> 24:29.560
of experience of the body, and that experience of the body is determined by your active engagement

24:29.560 --> 24:33.080
in breathing, so your record is, because the breathing of the body is there, and obviously

24:33.080 --> 24:38.240
the body is bound with a breathing, doesn't mean that, doesn't necessarily mean cause

24:38.240 --> 24:44.080
an effect, breathing results in body, that means they're inseparable, that's it, that's

24:44.080 --> 24:51.160
the problem, they always occur together, never apart, inconceivable to have them apart,

24:51.160 --> 24:57.200
you can't concede the breathing without a body, inclined in that act, you just can't be,

24:57.200 --> 25:03.400
no matter, even if it's the utmost abstraction, if you think breathing, it implies the body,

25:03.400 --> 25:10.880
thus it's a body, it's a body, it's a body, it's bound up with a body, so then you recognize

25:10.880 --> 25:17.080
okay, because this is inseparable from, this experience of the body right here, now separate

25:17.080 --> 25:21.720
from breathing, you don't have to think about your active breathing, but this body here,

25:21.720 --> 25:28.240
it's that body that is inseparable from breathing, so only form of experience of the body, it

25:28.240 --> 25:35.440
will be the body that implies breathing, inasmuch breathing implies the body, so then through

25:35.440 --> 25:46.040
calming down the mindful act of breathing, oh no, because that body, that abstract body,

25:46.040 --> 25:50.240
you can say even like that, that is implied in my thought of breathing, that abstract

25:50.240 --> 25:56.760
body is this body right here right there, and that relationship is external, but that

25:56.760 --> 26:02.880
body that you think of, when you look through the act of breathing, is that body right here

26:02.880 --> 26:11.200
right now, so then through affecting, through calming down the active breathing, calming down

26:11.200 --> 26:17.720
those thoughts in regard to the active breathing, actually you are pretending you are gradually

26:17.720 --> 26:23.440
affecting the body right here right now, because that relationship is external, the thoughts

26:23.440 --> 26:28.480
that you had in regard to breathing and the body that's assumed in that breathing, you're

26:28.480 --> 26:35.360
learning your head, that thought is the appearance of the thing, and that thought, that thought

26:35.360 --> 26:42.480
that has the tacit implication of a body in regard to breathing, that body there is

26:42.480 --> 26:49.880
the body that's right here right now, so when you think breathing and that abstract

26:49.880 --> 26:56.400
body that appears, that body is the body that you can access through your body, unless

26:56.400 --> 27:01.960
it's the thoughts of breathing, and that's it, it's this conscious body and name and form

27:01.960 --> 27:07.040
externally, the thoughts of breathing are the name and forms externally that imply that

27:07.040 --> 27:14.080
body, this conscious body right here right now, so instead of maintaining the connection

27:14.080 --> 27:18.600
of my body, my thoughts, you actually pull it out and you recognize no, it's the conscious

27:18.600 --> 27:22.840
body right here right now, and when I think about it, that's also external in regard to

27:22.840 --> 27:28.920
the conscious body, there is no internal dimension that it's mind, so through cultivating the

27:28.920 --> 27:34.920
act of breathing, the thoughts of breathing, the mindfully subreading, you start discerning

27:34.920 --> 27:41.000
a phenomenon of body within that act of breathing, there is actually this body right here right

27:41.000 --> 27:50.640
now, just seen from a different view at the same time, the body that appears, yeah, well

27:50.640 --> 27:55.440
don't, yeah, don't worry, that's a different approach, don't try and mix it, the elements

27:55.440 --> 28:03.360
and that, because of which it appears, but yeah, if you start seeing it at the same time,

28:03.360 --> 28:07.760
if a thing is present wise or if it's seen at the same time from two points of view, so

28:07.760 --> 28:12.920
to speak, none of them can be yours, because mind, me, I am, requires that singularity,

28:12.920 --> 28:18.200
I look from here to there, but now you recognize a thing is present, I'm seen from there, and

28:18.200 --> 28:25.200
experience right here at the same time, which one is yours, well you recognize none of them

28:25.200 --> 28:40.560
can be yours, so put your attention and experience of the body right here right now, and

28:40.560 --> 28:46.520
then start breathing, and through that breathing, discern the body, that then you study basically

28:46.520 --> 28:57.000
this discerning as, oh, the body that I'm discerning through my breathing actually stands for

28:57.000 --> 29:06.000
this very body that I'm experiencing right here right now, but the relationship is external.

29:06.000 --> 29:22.840
And then you can spread it, a thought of the body, that's all the name Rupa, that then

29:22.840 --> 29:27.560
you just conceived to be off, this is this body right here right now, through that internal

29:27.560 --> 29:28.560
connection.

29:28.560 --> 29:33.960
Oh, my thought is this body comes from this body, it's this body, in the body, out of the

29:33.960 --> 29:43.400
body, from the body, it's for me, it's my, but when you recognize the thought of the body,

29:43.400 --> 29:59.440
as in the reason phenomenon externally, and then see it standing for that body out there,

29:59.440 --> 30:12.360
yeah, out there right here, for that flesh eye, for that nose, for the tongue, again, flesh

30:12.360 --> 30:18.640
eye, it's a designation, it's an appearance, that stands for the flesh eye, but you assume

30:18.640 --> 30:25.200
oh, it's my flesh eye, but if you see that that flesh eye will not be known if there is

30:25.200 --> 30:31.040
no external appearance of a thought flesh eye, phenomenon without it, it's just inconceivable,

30:31.040 --> 30:36.520
inseparable from you, then it can't be yours, then it just becomes all external, oh, it's

30:36.520 --> 30:45.680
all out there, just there, right here, or younger, or whatever, none of it is mine.

30:45.680 --> 30:49.200
Because that's the thing, you don't need to keep constantly attending to this body right

30:49.200 --> 30:54.600
here right now, because this body is right here right now, and you're not sure about it.

30:54.600 --> 31:02.280
All you want to do is stop misconceiving it, or misconceiving things that appear in regard

31:02.280 --> 31:05.080
to this body right here right now.

31:05.080 --> 31:10.240
So mindfulness of breathing, through actively engaging in active breathing, you start discerning

31:10.240 --> 31:16.400
the body, the phenomenon of body, which you can, oh, this is my body, this is the same

31:16.400 --> 31:20.640
as this body, this is the body, all you just are seeing this body is basically that's

31:20.640 --> 31:25.240
the representation that we spoke earlier of the body present right here right now.

31:25.240 --> 31:29.120
So there's one way I'm looking at it, all you can then just be mindful of the erison

31:29.120 --> 31:39.040
body, conscious body right here right now.

31:39.040 --> 31:43.040
You can't really imagine it, because if you would imagine it accurately, it wouldn't

31:43.040 --> 31:48.200
be imagination, it would stand for how things are.

31:48.200 --> 31:54.400
The generalizes is seen from two points of view, always, you can't just have one point

31:54.400 --> 32:07.240
of view, inconsiderable, so it's always present, vice, simultaneous, not vice, there will be

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
one too.

32:08.240 --> 32:31.080
Here's a present, it's double, explain that, yeah, I can try it, but I can see that everything

32:31.080 --> 32:33.080
is seen from two different points of view.

32:33.080 --> 32:42.400
Like everything other it is, it arises, there are two points of view to every experience,

32:42.400 --> 32:46.840
simultaneous present, which is why you can then develop the assumption of one point of

32:46.840 --> 32:59.680
view, which is me.

32:59.680 --> 33:05.400
If you were to see that you're the center of your sense of self, it's always determined

33:05.400 --> 33:09.000
by something else different than the sense of self, it's two things of present, the

33:09.000 --> 33:14.280
center of the sense of self, and that which is there with you.

33:14.280 --> 33:18.640
At the same time, it's simultaneously present, a colleague, that's what it means, not

33:18.640 --> 33:29.480
pertain to time, it's simultaneous, there is no time in between.

33:29.480 --> 33:34.560
So if whichever point of view you took to be used, within that you discern, there is determined

33:34.560 --> 33:36.160
by that which you didn't take to be used.

33:36.160 --> 33:39.880
If you take that to be used, you discern, there is some, basically, no matter what point

33:39.880 --> 33:43.920
of view you take to be used, simultaneously it's determined by that which cannot be used

33:43.920 --> 33:47.520
at the same time, because you can't have both things at the same time, because I would

33:47.520 --> 33:52.240
require a third point of view, that's more general to these two point of view, but that's

33:52.240 --> 33:55.240
inconceivable.

33:55.240 --> 34:00.720
So you can't help but have a point of view, well sorry, you can't help but attend one

34:00.720 --> 34:06.040
point of view, but through that you discern another direction, that it's not the same direction,

34:06.040 --> 34:10.880
that it determines this direction.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.840
So there is a direction of the conscious body, and there is a direction of the name and

34:14.840 --> 34:22.880
form externally, and you can discern, both of them simultaneously present, obviously,

34:22.880 --> 34:27.240
you have to be attending one point of view together, if you attend conscious body, you'll be

34:27.240 --> 34:31.760
discerning the form externally, if you attend the form externally, you'll be discerning conscious

34:31.760 --> 34:34.240
body through that.

34:34.240 --> 34:38.040
But if that's all you can ever have, if you contemplate that long enough, you'll stop

34:38.040 --> 34:43.360
assuming one single unifying point of view, that it's neither here nor there, no box

34:43.360 --> 34:48.840
nor whatever, because that's only maintained through a simple knot, not discernment of

34:48.840 --> 34:53.440
the arrangement of things, basically by knot, fully understanding that things cannot

34:53.440 --> 35:00.640
be yours, you may attend the ocean of their mind.

35:00.640 --> 35:05.440
So right here right now, while you're thinking about what I've just said, your body is seated

35:05.440 --> 35:12.440
present with the conscious and spared with it, there's two same thing as things.

35:12.440 --> 35:19.840
And no matter how hard you're thinking, whatever you're thinking, through that, the discernment

35:19.840 --> 35:23.960
of this conscious body present right here right now is possible, because this conscious

35:23.960 --> 35:29.040
body right here right now is there, and in this particular instance, it's basically the

35:29.040 --> 35:34.640
reason why you're able to think in the first place.

35:34.640 --> 35:42.320
That's why any dama can also be a sancar, any of the aggregates can also be a determination

35:42.320 --> 35:44.200
because they're watching the breath.

35:44.200 --> 35:48.040
It depends what you attend, then the opposite, if the discern the opposite of where your

35:48.040 --> 35:49.040
attention is.

35:49.040 --> 35:53.480
So if I'm watching the body, if you're watching the body, I can see that it's been

35:53.480 --> 36:02.640
termination as the breath, but I'm not looking at the breath directly, I guess, so yeah,

36:02.640 --> 36:07.720
I can see it in the background just there, or if I'm looking at the breath, I can see

36:07.720 --> 36:08.720
the body.

36:08.720 --> 36:19.320
The practice is on the panasati, but just in terms of that practice, watching the breath

36:19.320 --> 36:20.320
and having the body.

36:20.320 --> 36:25.280
Well, in terms of that practice, yeah, you want to be doing the manifest of breathing.

36:25.280 --> 36:35.800
You want to be actively, because it's a form of enact, you want to tune yourself into

36:35.800 --> 36:42.600
the new breathing, and you recognize through this very act, you start discerning the implicit

36:42.600 --> 36:49.160
notion of the body, present, right there, right there, inseparable from.

36:49.160 --> 36:54.560
If something were to happen, while you're breathing there and discerning the body through

36:54.560 --> 37:04.800
the body, if those elements that the body is comprised of would change, disappear, be

37:04.800 --> 37:13.160
affected by some other external factor.

37:13.160 --> 37:19.560
You realize that the whole act that you're still mindful of engaging with breathing cannot

37:19.560 --> 37:27.120
remain standing, yet its foundations are completely inaccessible to you.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.120
You can't happen.

37:28.120 --> 37:33.600
If something happens to the elements, you can't possibly continue breathing.

37:33.600 --> 37:38.480
You can't possibly continue discerning the body through that.

37:38.480 --> 37:44.840
So through contemplating like that, you have abandoned the very nature of action, of intentional

37:44.840 --> 37:47.160
action that you're breathing.

37:47.160 --> 37:53.400
It's an act, it's a neutral act, which is what it will praise it.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.400
So you can't even do that long enough.

37:54.400 --> 38:00.720
You develop mindfulness that then won't be disturbed by any other form of act that

38:00.720 --> 38:04.560
the notion holds, obviously that, to be abandoned beforehand.

38:04.560 --> 38:10.920
So when you're sitting, walking, eating, talking, none of that then becomes, none of that continues

38:10.920 --> 38:19.000
to imply, well, the notion of permanence, the notion of controlling, regard to things.

38:19.000 --> 38:26.600
So you abandon your own intention, ceases to be yours, because through practicing of intentional

38:26.600 --> 38:30.920
ascending to breathing, and breathing in like this, breathing out like that, discerning

38:30.920 --> 38:34.560
the body through that, and then seeing that if that thing changes, if that determination

38:34.560 --> 38:38.960
is swept away, none of your present acts can remain.

38:38.960 --> 38:44.720
You do that long enough, none of the notions of I am, and this is me, this is for me, can

38:44.720 --> 38:47.240
remain standing, it will just evaporate.

38:47.240 --> 38:53.880
So you just breathe, and through breathing simultaneously, you discerning the presence

38:53.880 --> 38:55.440
of the body.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.760
Now you can start attending to the body right here right now, but then obviously you're

38:58.760 --> 39:01.560
not mindful of the breathing anymore.

39:01.560 --> 39:02.560
It's fine.

39:02.560 --> 39:06.000
You can be mindful of the body, but then you're not doing an open sati, that's also fine.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.680
And there's just one way of developing mindfulness.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.920
But if you are a stickton of a sati, you just continue breathing, while you discerning

39:13.920 --> 39:18.680
the body through that, and then it is all right, if I calm down, this breathing, this

39:18.680 --> 39:25.120
active engagement, that body will calm down.

39:25.120 --> 39:32.400
If I slow down the experience of that body through that slowing down and breath will be affected

39:32.400 --> 39:34.400
as well.

39:34.400 --> 39:39.440
And then you can contemplate the flow of the truth, or any other thing, as the Buddha says,

39:39.440 --> 39:40.880
through that breathing.

39:40.880 --> 39:50.000
So you have refined your active engagement with the action, with the nature of action.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.440
So you're not distracted, you're doing it mindfully.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.680
And through that you discerning the present, because no matter what you're doing, whether

39:56.680 --> 40:00.440
you're sweeping leaves, walking, sitting, talking, there is an implication of your body

40:00.440 --> 40:02.000
present right there, simultaneously.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.840
Because if that body is not present right there, right then simultaneously, you wouldn't

40:05.840 --> 40:09.360
be able to be engaging in these acts actively at the very time.

40:09.360 --> 40:17.120
You're not aware of it, you're not aware of the presence of the body.

40:17.120 --> 40:23.760
While you engage actively in this task, because your attention is mindful.

40:23.760 --> 40:27.320
So then you maintain the notion of appropriation through that very thing.

40:27.320 --> 40:31.840
But you start discerning the body, and then you recognize that, well, there is no room

40:31.840 --> 40:35.000
for me and I am in the act.

40:35.000 --> 40:42.960
Direct, this act, this intention, these choices are making, next moment, are all possible,

40:42.960 --> 40:51.320
because there is the implication that you can see through of the body, right what those

40:51.320 --> 40:54.240
acts are present.

40:54.240 --> 41:01.880
So is that thought that is crystallizing, or that body that's revealed, through mindful

41:01.880 --> 41:06.760
engagement with these acts, or the body is always present, there's a phenomenon of present

41:06.760 --> 41:13.520
body through these acts, and that body is at which this body is, when I think about it,

41:13.520 --> 41:14.520
separate it.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.720
So either, whether you think about it directly or indirectly, you stop conceiving it as

41:16.720 --> 41:17.720
yours.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.440
You see there's that thing out there, because of which you're able to move an act and

41:20.440 --> 41:21.440
choose.

41:21.440 --> 41:25.960
And then you start seeing your own choices as a result, because of that present conscious

41:25.960 --> 41:30.920
body out there and out there at the time.

41:30.920 --> 41:35.600
So then next time you make a choice, or rather, when you practice it sufficiently, then when

41:35.600 --> 41:40.280
the choices are being made, even that, the most personal thing I want this over there,

41:40.280 --> 41:45.960
ceases to induce the notion of personality, because its understanding is seen through

41:45.960 --> 41:54.320
it through, because would you be able to think, unrelated things to your body, just think

41:54.320 --> 42:00.960
something completely out of the imagination, abstraction, can't you see?

42:00.960 --> 42:04.560
Would that be possible, if the body is not present?

42:04.560 --> 42:09.400
If the body, if the consciousness is not present, then living there.

42:09.400 --> 42:14.800
So no matter how disconnected, unrelated your thoughts might be, the nature of the thought

42:14.800 --> 42:17.320
is bound with the body.

42:17.320 --> 42:24.440
Inasmuch, the body is bound with the mind, I, thoughts.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.800
Hence it only depends what you attend, it will be determined by the other.

42:27.800 --> 42:32.040
Because you wouldn't be able to even think about body, or talk about body.

42:32.040 --> 42:38.000
If the mind doesn't designate you as a time as body, as that, as that physical in regard

42:38.000 --> 42:45.520
to itself, or as that mental in regard to itself.

42:45.520 --> 42:50.120
So to fully discern that, those thoughts in regard to body would stop conceiving, would

42:50.120 --> 42:55.360
stop making you assume that that is actually that matter, no, it's still the thoughts.

42:55.360 --> 43:01.920
So you can have your thoughts and thoughts, that's why the mind comes first.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.520
Would you know a cup is a cup?

43:04.520 --> 43:10.600
Would you know matter is matter, like even saying it matter, thinking it matter.

43:10.600 --> 43:14.120
That's all a good designation, that's all you have.

43:14.120 --> 43:19.680
Just designations are different levels of generality pertaining to different things, but still

43:19.680 --> 43:34.560
designations.

43:34.560 --> 44:00.640
So what you really do is make sure that when it comes to the designation of the body,

44:00.640 --> 44:08.080
in regards to body, whether peripherally, whether directly, when you're attending it,

44:08.080 --> 44:12.400
you don't conceive that that is that matter, you don't conceive that that is what those

44:12.400 --> 44:19.080
great elements are, because they will always remain below your feet, they will always remain

44:19.080 --> 44:25.280
that because of which this appearance is, and this appearance in this case is the designation

44:25.280 --> 44:30.440
of this body, right here right now that I'm seeing, I can touch parts of it, I can think

44:30.440 --> 44:36.600
about it, that's all fine, that's the only thing you can have, even if you were to think

44:36.600 --> 44:42.520
about it, just stop conceiving that to be standing for this external world of four great elements,

44:42.520 --> 44:49.760
because that's another thought, so you have your thoughts in regards to thoughts, but those

44:49.760 --> 44:54.160
thoughts can be discerned, oh they are because of the four great elements that I'm thinking

44:54.160 --> 44:59.320
right here right now, which is all I can do, but I'm not conceiving to be those four great

44:59.320 --> 45:03.400
elements, and that's the important thing, because if you only say, oh all you have is your

45:03.400 --> 45:09.720
thoughts, then you fall into a very obvious naive form of ideal, whatever you think it's

45:09.720 --> 45:14.080
in your head, well no, see, whatever I think it's in my head, you assume your head to be

45:14.080 --> 45:18.400
materially in regard to your thoughts, but then even that is your thoughts, you can't even

45:18.400 --> 45:22.000
in touch or be saying whatever you're thinking it's in my head, because that's in my head,

45:22.000 --> 45:27.120
which is in my head, which is in my head, which is in my head, indefinitely, but if you

45:27.120 --> 45:35.640
recognize the notion of my head, it's because it's underlined by the four great elements,

45:35.640 --> 45:42.880
there are also another notion, but the notion does not conceive itself to be the actual

45:42.880 --> 45:47.240
four great elements, or to be apart from them, which would imply them to be something else,

45:47.240 --> 45:52.520
or to be in them, or to be from them, or to be for me, or to be mind.

45:52.520 --> 45:57.480
The notion just doesn't conceive any of that, it's as the notion, it's known, and notion

45:57.480 --> 46:07.360
is known as a notion, so it doesn't conceive that because of which the notion is, or put

46:07.360 --> 46:14.160
it in more simple terms, the notion is fully disowned, the notion is disowned as impossible

46:14.160 --> 46:21.200
to know, notion is a dharma, a dharma, notion is a phenomenon, notion of this, notion of

46:21.200 --> 46:27.840
that, think, I thought you can call it whatever you want, basically a phenomenon, phenomenon

46:27.840 --> 46:31.480
is that which has an age to appear, what has an age to appear, everything has an age

46:31.480 --> 46:36.440
to appear that you can talk about, things that have no age to appear, you can't possibly

46:36.440 --> 46:42.680
disown it, since they don't appear, you can't even think about it.

46:42.680 --> 46:58.280
When you reach that understanding, abide in that understanding, yeah, become that understanding,

46:58.280 --> 47:05.240
it would used to say about finding a balance in it, it's you, you can't find it.

47:05.240 --> 47:09.240
When you need to balance it, once you understood, you can't undo the understanding, so there's

47:09.240 --> 47:15.040
no balance to be maintained, because it's developed, and that's why you know it's developed

47:15.040 --> 47:21.800
with vision that you see it, what you're talking about now, you see it, but then you

47:21.800 --> 47:26.360
can, well you can know that it hasn't been developed sufficiently, it hasn't been developed

47:26.360 --> 47:32.720
fully, and then you just have to keep repeating it and drilling it, they're very, same inside.

47:32.720 --> 47:51.120
Find the best to get in there, those dummies, those, yeah, by understanding the dummies,

47:51.120 --> 47:57.400
by understanding the, that which has an age to appear, which is your thoughts, your feelings,

47:57.400 --> 48:08.920
your intentions, so perception has an age to appear, feeling has an age to appear, attention

48:08.920 --> 48:19.120
has an age to appear, even your attention has an age to appear, because you can talk

48:19.120 --> 48:24.040
well I'm attending to this, so it's indirect, it's negative in regard to what is being

48:24.040 --> 48:34.400
attended, but it appears, has an attention, and so all of that is normal, the designation,

48:34.400 --> 48:42.840
name, that's a Nama Rupa, Rupa, there you go, you just said it in the same sense, you

48:42.840 --> 48:50.280
said in the same way you said Nama, so Rupa is also designation, but it's a more general

48:50.280 --> 48:57.240
designation than the designation of Nama, more fundamental, directional, but it still

48:57.240 --> 49:02.960
maintains actually to the nature of the designation, they then stops conceiving itself to be

49:02.960 --> 49:13.840
that Rupa, Nama Rupa, that's all, what is all, it's Nama Rupa, that's all they can

49:13.840 --> 49:23.800
appear, nothing else except Nama Rupa can appear, but it doesn't mean that Rupa is actually

49:23.800 --> 49:37.400
the Rupa because of which Nama Rupa is as appearance, so there's only one way to correctly

49:37.400 --> 49:46.480
accurately designate Rupa, and that way is by not having that designation stand for that

49:46.480 --> 49:53.120
Rupa, if it doesn't, if it doesn't conceive that Rupa, the designation of Rupa doesn't

49:53.120 --> 50:01.840
conceive Rupa, that's the only accurate designation, and that's the liberation, you practice

50:01.840 --> 50:08.440
that, and it will be free from all conceivants, from all implications of my, thus from all

50:08.440 --> 50:25.080
implications of I am, thus from all implications of self, myself, and personality, or you can

50:25.080 --> 50:32.080
take your experience as a whole, and regard, and you have kind of things aspects of it

50:32.080 --> 50:37.600
in a more mental, and aspects of it in a more material, so to speak, but both are actually

50:37.600 --> 50:44.240
part of the designation, Nama in regard to Rupa, so what you have to do is, while they

50:44.240 --> 50:50.600
are simultaneously present, well stop regarding the material aspect, as, stop assuming the

50:50.600 --> 50:56.080
material aspect, as pertaining to the actual method, because of which the designation of material

50:56.080 --> 51:09.320
aspects can, can arise, stop conceiving them, because any movement of your mind, it's

51:09.320 --> 51:19.720
already pertaining to the, it appears, thus it's part of Nama in regard to Rupa, so you

51:19.720 --> 51:27.560
can know your experience as a whole, and whatever shape and form can arise, it's because of

51:27.560 --> 51:34.360
the four great elements, as long as that knowledge, well then you won't be a knowledge, but

51:34.360 --> 51:39.360
as long as that thought, does not conceal the four great elements, through the thought

51:39.360 --> 51:43.520
about them, you don't actually assume that that's what they are, or that there's something

51:43.520 --> 51:49.120
else, or elsewhere, or both, or neither, you just don't give into any of those, you just

51:49.120 --> 51:56.400
have a thought of four great elements, so you don't overdo it, you don't underdo it,

51:56.400 --> 52:02.640
and then that thought won't be conceiving them, they won't find footing in your experience,

52:02.640 --> 52:07.760
which means your experience will be free, and that's just something that needs to be repeated

52:07.760 --> 52:13.160
on and on, not through different means, but you end up repeating the same principle,

52:13.160 --> 52:28.160
by all the other things, it's a hard call of contemplation, it's a bit of a head spin-off,

52:28.160 --> 52:37.440
well it's a head spin-off, obviously you will not be as particular as that, but you

52:37.440 --> 52:44.800
don't have to, because they are much less particular things, sorry, much less ambiguous

52:44.800 --> 52:50.960
things that you can contemplate, there would be maintaining and obviously drilling the

52:50.960 --> 52:58.840
same principle, no mind, not for me, not for my control, if you extend that principle

52:58.840 --> 53:03.800
to the point of pertaining to the thought of not mine, not for me, not my control, then

53:03.800 --> 53:08.120
you won't leave anything excluded, and if you repeat that long enough, then that will

53:08.120 --> 53:12.440
become apparent, because it does correspond with how things actually are, not yours, not

53:12.440 --> 53:22.040
for you, not in your control, how do you call it, okay, that's the Mola Parianas

53:22.040 --> 53:38.040
so it did amongst the not-the rejoicing world, because they didn't understand it, right,

53:38.040 --> 53:47.880
for example, there's elements we're talking about today as well, essential pleasure, essential

53:47.880 --> 53:56.760
pleasure element, and renunciation element, doubt, yeah, and your will element, not your

53:56.760 --> 54:10.400
will element, cruelty element, not cruelty element, so when one is experiencing your will,

54:10.400 --> 54:19.480
your will is the greater, and seeing those two things, why is it, then I'll go greater,

54:19.480 --> 54:36.280
why is it more, why is it greater, why is it greater, but it takes, it doesn't take

54:36.280 --> 54:46.200
you, no, that's why it holds them, but why is it greater, why is it structurally greater,

54:46.200 --> 54:57.000
then your will, why is your will lower, then your will, because your will is determined,

54:57.000 --> 55:03.400
no, it's because your will can only rise in regard to particular things, yes, that's

55:03.400 --> 55:08.200
what I was trying, actually, yeah, it only, so if you experience your will, it's going

55:08.200 --> 55:13.720
to be in regard to something, even if it's a very general ambiguous mood of thought, you're

55:13.720 --> 55:20.240
having your will in regard to that, which means your will is always circumstantial, because

55:20.240 --> 55:26.960
these things could have not or risen, so which is more, things that, sorry, no more, which

55:26.960 --> 55:30.920
is more, oh yeah, no, can you have, can you have desired a last or your will in regard

55:30.920 --> 55:35.720
to things that you've never seen, you've never heard, you've never thought of, you can't,

55:35.720 --> 55:40.480
you can't have, you just see it's inconceivable to experience these other last or a version

55:40.480 --> 55:46.280
in regard to that which is never, has never manifested in any particular form, you can't

55:46.280 --> 55:52.560
have those, those things, you can only have non-real will, you can only have non-aversion,

55:52.560 --> 56:01.360
non-last, that's the default mood, on the basis of non-last, you develop last in regard

56:01.360 --> 56:06.320
to something that's being manifested, but if you know that I can't have lost in regard

56:06.320 --> 56:12.920
to things that are not manifested, that means that whatever is manifested, it's circumstantial,

56:12.920 --> 56:17.800
because if it was manifested and hasn't been manifested before, if it was manifested

56:17.800 --> 56:23.400
means, it could have not been manifested, and it certainly means, oh, it's manifested,

56:23.400 --> 56:30.800
does, it would unmanifest, it will cease because it has a reason, you can't possibly have

56:30.800 --> 56:37.720
lost for that which does manifest, you can't possibly have well for that which does manifest,

56:37.720 --> 56:41.520
so then when you do have last or your will, you recognize, oh, it's in regard to a circumstantial

56:41.520 --> 56:50.920
thing that could have not been, does it completely treat us, does, it's unnecessary, does it's impossible,

56:50.920 --> 56:57.400
because last would actually imply that whole notion of, oh, this is special, this particular,

56:57.400 --> 57:02.360
this is worth, this is valuable, this is great, but when you recognize that it's circumstantial,

57:02.360 --> 57:07.160
it, it, it, it, it, it, while it loses its elevators, this is important, yeah, that's

57:07.160 --> 57:17.160
what it means by saying, non-nil will is greater, it's more fundamental, it's more important,

57:17.160 --> 57:24.720
why, because there are more things that happen in a reason, there are more things that are

57:24.720 --> 57:29.280
manifested, and for them we should, for them we can't have lost, we can't have a little

57:29.280 --> 57:33.760
ago which means, there is more non-nil will, even for people who are always angry, they're

57:33.760 --> 57:37.920
always angry, that's a particular, which means on the general level, there is more non-nil

57:37.920 --> 57:44.680
will, so that's why you don't do the non-nil will, you just discern it, and because of that

57:44.680 --> 57:52.080
you can't engage in a will, and same, you discern the absence of passion as an inherent

57:52.080 --> 57:57.720
characteristics of the five aggregates, and because of that you stop at the 10 notions

57:57.720 --> 58:03.760
of passion in regard to the five aggregates, who pedan is not the five aggregates, he can't

58:03.760 --> 58:10.600
possibly be, but it's not found anywhere else apart from that, is the designer last in regard

58:10.600 --> 58:25.240
to five aggregates, the idea assumption is there, the non-design, non-last, or the five

58:25.240 --> 58:31.680
aggregates, it's greater than particular manifestation of desire in regard to the particular

58:31.680 --> 58:37.320
manifestation of the five aggregates, it's always essential, it always could have not

58:37.320 --> 58:41.800
been, and that's another of the manipulations before, you start thinking that over the things

58:41.800 --> 58:50.280
that are appearing, oh this could have not been, and this it will not be for me, so this

58:50.280 --> 58:55.920
could have not been, the things that will be will not be for me, because that circumstantial

58:55.920 --> 59:02.800
mess of it, the thread of it just pertains to the past, to the present, and the past that

59:02.800 --> 59:07.080
is present, and the future that is present as a possibility, oh so when the things in the

59:07.080 --> 59:12.600
future, if this ball is still remains standing in your eyes, it's impossible for them to

59:12.600 --> 59:19.120
arrive for me, as much as this present thing is also impossible to be accepted by me,

59:19.120 --> 59:23.000
it's impossible to be for me, that's your real is always, my whole past was actually

59:23.000 --> 59:31.760
never for me, and that's who it was never mine, so that's how you don't dwell in the past,

59:31.760 --> 59:36.960
and you don't go in the future, by discerning the present, by discerning them through the

59:36.960 --> 59:44.440
present, not by stopping your thinking and the refraining from thinking about your past.

59:44.440 --> 59:57.560
But by fully discerning that if thing is inaccessible now, their nature pertains in the future,

59:57.560 --> 01:00:03.760
and their nature pervades the past, so that's why Arunhand does not like, you know, he was

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.480
in Arun always, but when he becomes in Arun, he doesn't have thoughts anymore, I was in

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:13.720
the past, now I'm in Arunhand, but I was in the past before, I actually was, as a person,

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:20.440
that whole thing is affected, why? because your present, any future, sorry, your past and

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:26.520
your future are both present, so either have present towards possibility, present future,

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.040
when you have all you have the overdetermined present which is your past, obviously you

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:36.120
don't have always laid in front of you past, present, future, because they will require

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.640
an entity, a subject that kind of has an overview of these three things, they're the flowing

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.320
in front of your eyes as a slideshow or something, you are part of that, which means you can

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:57.200
only have overdetermined present, that is present, or underdetermined present, that is present,

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.680
in other words you can have past that is present, if that's the direction you're looking,

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.840
or if you look in direction possibilities, you can have the future that's not yet present

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:12.160
and that's present, so it's a bit more complex, complex, for people who commonly think

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:17.720
it, I don't think about the future, don't go into the past, well no, that's present and

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:25.400
you have no choice about that present, don't regard your past as yours, don't plan

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.240
your future as belonging to you, as belonging to you, as arising for you, and there's no

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:42.640
problem, you think the future you want, it might not be, sorry, it will not be, it will

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:50.840
not be for me, and certainly it could have not been, whatever it is, it could have been

01:01:50.840 --> 01:02:04.280
not, circumstantial, circumstantial, so if you make any choices, any decisions, commit

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:11.400
any act, based on that which is circumstantial, you can only regard those choices, those

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:17.720
acts as yours, if you forget, or if you don't fully discern, the dependence of your choices

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:24.080
upon this circumstantially, a reason thing, if you remain mindful of the circumstantial nature

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.800
of the reason thing upon which you're acting and choosing and deciding, you won't be

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:35.480
only your choice either, but that can be only abandoned present, you can't go in hindsight

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:40.240
and say, ah well because things are not mine, my decisions are not mine as well, well that's

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:47.680
wishful thinking, you have to see that directly, while things are seen as ideas, why you decide

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:53.680
upon that, will not be yours, and then limits the things you can decide, because if you do

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.520
see circumstantial, a reason thing as the present, simultaneously present the terminations

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.400
of your choices in regard to the circumstantial thing, your choices cannot be infected by

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:22.680
the last version of delusion, it's impossible, because last version of delusion requires the

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:32.840
opposite of circumstantial, it requires the special, the important to the mind, but you see

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:38.840
that it can't be yours, it's not special, it's particularly a reason, but I can't

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.880
have the basis of all of it, it's not a reason, and you can't last the words it, and you

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:52.200
certainly can't have a little to the words it, and you won't be the living in regard to it,

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.240
it's just not worthy anymore, exactly, and that's what we're going to say, this is not worthy

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:23.200
of delight, of craving, it's not worthy, and you automatically stop doing it, even the

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:35.920
grief that arises through abandoning this, it's in this realm, again, the grief that

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:41.800
happens, it's within that, even that is circumstantial, so you surmount that, you're surmounting

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:51.160
grief as well, because grief is grief only when it's mind, but you stop grieving when it

01:04:51.160 --> 01:05:09.840
doesn't pertain to you anymore, it's up when if you are renouncing sensual pleasures

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:24.760
actually bring you strength, you're emulating the right order of thinking, but you also

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.360
know no matter what happens, because of your renouncing, because of your not engaging

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:36.440
sensual pleasures, it can't be a good thing, and it's, yeah, that's what we're going

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.760
to say, even if a person doesn't develop any wisdom, even if a monk doesn't develop

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:48.480
any wisdom, stays a protusion basically, and lives his whole life, his renunciation

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:55.120
life in tears, because of the pain of his renouncing, it's still better than giving

01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:04.720
him the sensuality, because at least he's living the principle, the principle of non-last,

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:10.600
because anyone can say anyone, he won't be enlightened as a result of it, but he certainly

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:16.480
by living the principle, he brings himself closer to enlightenment, obviously, in lives

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:23.120
to come, so it's still better in a long run, but when you have the knowledge, when you

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.640
have the knowledge, the sense, the principle that you start living beforehand, which is

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:35.560
why Celia has to come first, that the knowledge discerns, that's it, you discern, you

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.360
fully understood, now you don't even have to keep doing it, because you are it, you don't

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:45.240
have to keep emulating the principle, when you become a principle.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.200
Yes, it takes over, yes, that's all, yes.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:55.920
But always you can spend all emulating you want, now when it points out to you, if you

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:01.860
don't discern it, you won't, you will remain a Batujana, so that's why, there is no

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:08.560
dhamma without Celia, but certainly Celia is not dhamma, but the dhamma is impossible

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:16.120
to have without starting with emulation of the right principle, because dhamma is done

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:24.360
properly renunciation, can very easily be wisdom, with very little instruction, that's why

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:31.120
he sees the, he sees the danger in the slightest fault, doesn't mean he becomes neurotic, obsessed

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:37.120
with anxiety, he means he sees the danger, he starts discerning it, the slightest deviation

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.440
from the principle can be an obstacle, massive obstacle later on, it's a big danger,

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:57.360
so I won't deviate, it's like, you know, your ship is on a course, and you might move it

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:01.800
just like, I don't know, 0.01 degree, but then if that course goes long enough, that 0.01

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:23.520
can pose you to miss the whole continent, because eventually it will light up, so if

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:30.600
you literally, if you just start emulating the principle of non-last, non-aversion, non-delusion,

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:39.160
non-indolence, with your body, with your speech, with your mind, with little instruction from

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:45.320
the suitors, maybe more than enough, obviously, you need to emulate the principle harder, with

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:51.120
more discerning, disdestruction, you can emulate it, to a lesser extent, because then the

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.600
knowledge can take good quicker, and then obviously you become it, it doesn't mean like

01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:03.160
somebody will keep the presets less if they understand, on the contrary, they need to

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:08.920
worry less about the presets when they understand, or if they have more understanding, it will

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.960
take good quicker, but for those who don't have, who have lots of faith, and then just

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:21.160
emulate heavily, they really need to take a whole new level of emulation, and then it

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:27.680
will take good, you know, with a little knowledge, they might have, but they need life, without

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.560
any knowledge, as I said, you can emulate the principle all you want, they were very

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.480
wholesome like, we become very authentic, but you can still remember to do that if nobody

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:42.320
bought you, but today it's kind of impossible, because today nobody emulates the principle

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.240
of wholesome living, and those who do, do it as a result of the Buddhist instruction, which

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:54.840
means, those family of the principal are already familiar enough with the Buddhist teaching,

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.480
they may not all go into all the details that we just talked about, for example, conceiving

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.520
and stuff, but they don't need to, so they emulate, you see, they're familiar with the

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.160
principle, and then you start discerning that that is how things actually are, not yours,

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:14.120
not for you, not in your control, not possible to actually be affected by last, not possible

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:23.680
to be affected by a way, not possible to be affected by the illusion, pain that is, and

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:31.000
then all the factors will fall off, it's a slow reprocess, then the one who is emulating

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:38.000
the principle and actively trying to understand it, but to double, yeah, double, but basically

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:51.000
you fight in both fronts, but it's the same relation, it's the same result, and it's

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.520
the same relation, yeah, it's just always, if somebody is just emulating the principle,

01:10:54.520 --> 01:11:01.160
I'm not trying to understand the principle as well, then you might have people with greater

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:08.240
intellectual capacities, they can understand the principle with actually quite a pure emulation,

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.840
they seal it, no, actually develop properly, but they have quite, quite some intelligence

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:18.200
they can discern, and then we'll develop, but until they develop and they seal it properly,

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.320
this understanding of that principle will not reach to fulfillment, that's what sort

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:29.800
of buttons, who have seal us efficiently for sort of party, but not our hands yet, they

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:37.560
need to keep practicing nekama, renunciation, restraint, and feel the principle fully

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:43.240
when it's everything, so they just need to stick to the virtuous living, sort of on us,

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:52.400
and they'll become our hands, because they've fully understood the principle, oh, the

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:58.360
ones who didn't stick to the virtuous living, they didn't compromise their understanding,

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:04.280
they just slowed down their progress, like the sort of buttons in the suit as I mentioned,

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:11.080
or in the minerals, you know, the drinking, like lay people as well, he was a sort of

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:18.200
button, but he was drunk and so on, so he wasn't keeping the principles, why, because he

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:25.480
had faculties developed, to such an extent that he could discern the principle at the

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.240
very little occasion, where he did keep the priests, where he did live also many, and

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.960
he discerned the principle, then, you know, his habit and last took him over, but the

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:41.400
principle was discerned, so at most in several lifetimes he would have brought it to fulfillment,

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.360
and there's a thing that says when he's discerning the principle, he's virtuous, so at the

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.760
moment of death, when you can't engage in anything circumstantial, he is that principle,

01:12:51.760 --> 01:13:09.640
that's why it's often, it's such a prominent kind of role of that in the suit, when somebody

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.960
who has the right view, or who is, who's only a mere each, oh well, he might attend,

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.240
he doesn't attend the fruits of his understanding, he is slightly attending the moment of death,

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:27.680
because it's where the principle is, not mine, not for me, not in my control, that's what

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.600
death is, the manifestation of death, you can abide in that for quite some, you know,

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.160
well you can develop it before you actually go through it, that's where the German died

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:42.160
before you die, he didn't mean that in a poetic, inspirational way as well, it's quite a

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:47.200
fact, die before you die, go where the death is, and abandon it yourself before it hits

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:54.640
you, go where the death is, yes, go where the death is, because death is everything opposite

01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.920
of my life, death is the ultimate not yours, you can think, you own death, you can think

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:07.120
you're ready for death, only arrogance is ready for death, because there's no, no holding

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:14.520
of any form of life, any form of Baba, any form of meaning, but for Patugina, death always

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:23.760
comes from the opposite way you're looking at, it always comes from behind, from behind

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.360
your attention, from underneath you feel, which means you can never be prepared for death,

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:36.080
that's Patugina, that's so explainable, so explainable you can, but you will still experience

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:42.380
some anguish in regard to it, because well, because you have left work, I'm done, you

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:48.360
can just do the principle, but you haven't been emulating it sufficiently, for it permeate

01:14:48.360 --> 01:15:12.740
everything and make all of the factors evaporate in this day, where's your boy, good sleep,

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:23.260
so perfectly emulating all some living, see the danger in the slightest fault, with the

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:27.620
instruction that you already have, with the decircumnication that you already have, you

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:32.780
will probably be the tenth of it, he will be enough, but it needs to be done, it needs

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:42.600
to be stuck to and maintained, for our long well that that can be only known in hindsight,

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:48.040
Once you get it, once you once, once the mind knows that it knows, then you can say, okay, well,

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.440
took me only a four-night.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.040
It took me only seven years.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.280
It took me only seventeen years.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.720
In a long scheme of things, it's nothing.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:13.000
Took me only this like that.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:46.680
Because investigation of Thomas investigation is cannot be very painful.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:54.200
Yeah, trying to think, thinking about these things too.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:01.400
Well, it's painful in the beginning, because you don't really know what to think about,

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:08.040
and how to think about, so then it requires, once you know, then you will be able to tune in your

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:15.320
effort. So you won't be ashamed. You won't be painful. Just thinking about them, I see,

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:21.240
like, you think I have to think about these things. You can say that, but basically it's more

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.000
accurate. You have to discern these things within what has already risen, the demos they have

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.480
already risen. You just need to change the way of looking at what's already right in front of

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.120
you all the time, and you're not just about it. You're not fabricating anything new,

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:41.640
you're just discerning within what's already there. And that's actually quite effortless.

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:54.200
Because really, you're renunciation, you're just keeping the precepts.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.080
Yeah, and we're not in there. Yeah, can you walk some pain?

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.760
Looking up to your thoughts, probably, keeping the precepts. Yeah.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.440
That's, yeah, they can walk pain, of course. But even that, you know, all the pain in the

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:14.200
beginning, the same as giving up any habits, central habits in particular. Because the pain in

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:19.160
the beginning, but then after what it doesn't, it evolves the pain in the beginning because you're

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:25.160
just too dependent on, you know, the non-renunciation. But if you stick with renunciation,

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.960
then you recognize what actually, you know, this is the natural state of things which,

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:32.040
it's a sensuality that requires the effort, not other way around.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.840
The renunciation has a required effort. It requires the effort when you will mind

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:42.040
distal center upon the sensuality. And saying no to it requires the effort when you start discerning,

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:48.200
that that is the, that is the correct order. Sensuality is circumstantial,

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.640
arisen on the basis of non-sensuality. Thus, it's sensuality that requires effort.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.840
So by not engaging in sensuality, you're effortless. No burden, no pressure.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:04.440
And then your mind just won't go to sensuality because that's, that which needs effort,

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:10.120
not the current state. But that wouldn't have happened if you haven't been emulating the current state

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:14.360
beforehand. If you haven't been emulating the non-sensuality beforehand.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:26.440
I thought it delighting the renunciation. No, it's secluded. It's effortless. You have to do that.

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:36.120
And that's just without all the other more important methods of not exposing yourself to danger and

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:51.640
your mind and everything else. You're freedom. And peace to all of you.
