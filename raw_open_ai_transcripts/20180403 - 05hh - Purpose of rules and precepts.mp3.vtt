00:00.000 --> 00:13.880
So, what is the purpose, the rules, the precepts, why do you practice renunciation?

00:13.880 --> 00:20.920
The purpose of it is developing the strength of your mind and the absolute first step

00:20.920 --> 00:31.240
for that is to be able to say no to yourself, to say no to your desires, wins, habits.

00:31.240 --> 00:39.040
So every, all of the main rules upon which a practice is based is they're very practical.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.520
So to speak functional, necessary in that sense.

00:42.520 --> 00:48.360
They're not held because of a belief or because of the authority, they're held because

00:48.360 --> 00:56.440
they're held in themselves, the practice of meditation and development of the mind.

00:56.440 --> 01:03.120
So basically think of the rules as a fertile ground where you can plant seeds of a plant

01:03.120 --> 01:05.920
or some trees.

01:05.920 --> 01:13.080
So it's not a tree, it's not a seed, but having a grown tree would be impossible if you

01:13.080 --> 01:18.960
don't have a fertile ground to do so.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.000
So in that sense, you see the necessity of the fertile ground, you see the necessity

01:23.000 --> 01:25.720
of the rules.

01:25.720 --> 01:29.520
Without them, there's no point if you cultivating seeds and watering the plant when you have

01:29.520 --> 01:34.360
destroyed the fertility of the ground, when you have compromised the fundamental rules.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.400
What are you trying to do?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
Sorry?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.200
What are you trying to do?

01:39.200 --> 01:45.480
Well you're trying to grow the freedom, freedom of your mind, because the mind is bound

01:45.480 --> 01:49.880
by the desire, by the craving, by the feelings.

01:49.880 --> 01:54.040
Mind is liable to feelings, which means when suffering arises, you won't be able to prevent

01:54.040 --> 01:55.040
it.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.560
When pleasure arises, you won't be able but to indulge it.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.400
Means you're controlled by what you feel.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.400
And you're controlled because the mind is too weak in regard to what it feels.

02:05.400 --> 02:11.160
So you want to become stronger than all those things, and the first step to developing of

02:11.160 --> 02:18.640
that strength is mere restraint, being able to say no, not to everything, forever, but

02:18.640 --> 02:24.840
to certain things that are inseparable from desire, craving, ill will hate anything

02:24.840 --> 02:28.840
unhoused and basically.

02:28.840 --> 02:41.080
Yeah, eating at a certain time, it's again, it's just like you eat because it is necessary

02:41.080 --> 02:44.080
for the body to remain alive.

02:44.080 --> 02:50.520
But you don't want to be using it as a sensuality, as a form of escape, and then you just keep

02:50.520 --> 02:54.400
eating throughout the day, eating only what you like and so on.

02:54.400 --> 02:59.440
So you recognize a degree of necessity to eat, and that's what you focus on.

02:59.440 --> 03:04.040
And yeah, if you eat enough calories once in a day, that's absolutely fine.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.400
There is absolutely no reason to eat more.

03:07.400 --> 03:12.680
Eating more than what you need is going to be bound to come out of sensuality, out of craving,

03:12.680 --> 03:13.680
out of desire.

03:13.680 --> 03:21.400
But it's not a life-threatening hunger.

03:21.400 --> 03:27.120
So basically in the evening, you have desire to eat, and instead of habitually just giving

03:27.120 --> 03:34.800
into desire and satisfying it by any means, you force yourself to reflect on it, because

03:34.800 --> 03:39.280
you know you want to eat, you want to break the rule, so as a form of restraint, what's

03:39.280 --> 03:40.280
the alternative?

03:40.280 --> 03:45.280
Well, it's to think, okay, why, how, why am I pulled by this desire, why this hunger

03:45.280 --> 03:48.160
controlling my mind?

03:48.160 --> 03:51.520
And that's how you, that's how you go beyond the desire, eventually.

03:51.520 --> 03:57.760
If I ate a meal at night, I started eating, then I'll be free from desire.

03:57.760 --> 04:06.200
No you won't, you, you'll be free from hunger, but the hunger was not your desire.

04:06.200 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, there would have been no desire without a hunger, but the hunger is not a desire.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.760
Desire is always mental.

04:16.760 --> 04:22.960
So when the hunger, when the physical state affects, controls your mind, then it becomes

04:22.960 --> 04:28.880
a desire, which means you might go and remove the physical state, but the liability of your

04:28.880 --> 04:34.880
mind to be controlled by the physical state remains, which means next physical thing comes

04:34.880 --> 04:38.280
and you're going to equally be bound by the same desire.

04:38.280 --> 04:42.560
Hence you don't set, you can't satisfy a desire, and everybody knows that.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.600
You can be chasing and engaging in all sorts of sensuality, you can never satisfy a desire,

04:47.600 --> 04:48.600
why?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.520
Because it's not where you're trying to satisfy.

04:50.520 --> 04:55.360
You're satisfied with physical circumstances, but those are not what the desire is.

04:55.360 --> 05:00.120
Yeah, desire is inseparable from those, but it's not those.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.520
It's not those things.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.880
So your precepts, thanks.

05:05.880 --> 05:10.960
So the precepts are basically just like laying out the ground where you can practice.

05:10.960 --> 05:17.840
Just putting up a fence, fertilizing the ground, and agreeing upon those things.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.960
As a starting point, you have to start somewhere.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.520
So all the precepts were basically, that's what I mean, they were quite functional in

05:24.520 --> 05:25.520
that sense.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.520
Ah, you eat.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.800
In the beginning the monks were allowed to eat in the evening.

05:30.800 --> 05:34.480
It was not specified you don't in the morning, they could eat many times a day.

05:34.480 --> 05:39.520
But then it was sort of becoming impractical for various reasons, going out at night to

05:39.520 --> 05:47.080
collect the food, getting up all sorts of accidents and so on.

05:47.080 --> 05:54.000
So then a rule was brought in, you eat it at the right time, so you don't go out to collect

05:54.000 --> 05:58.720
food at night to go during the day, then they could still eat at night, but then you stop

05:58.720 --> 05:59.720
eating at night as well.

05:59.720 --> 06:03.680
You just eat when you go and get the food, it just becomes more practical, easier, and

06:03.680 --> 06:07.320
you don't spend the rest of your day being concerned and planning about the food, you

06:07.320 --> 06:09.480
spend it practicing restraint.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.200
And practicing wisdom and practicing meditation.

06:12.200 --> 06:20.480
Well, those, yeah, the eighth precepts, those are the basis of practice, those are the,

06:20.480 --> 06:26.120
that's what defines their fertile ground, they're not negotiable.

06:26.120 --> 06:30.720
Like how can you possibly be practicing the clarity of the mind, developing the strength

06:30.720 --> 06:35.760
of your mind, when you're drinking alcohol, that's clearly directly affecting the clarity

06:35.760 --> 06:37.240
of the mind.

06:37.240 --> 06:43.200
And it has no practical value, like you need to eat some food, you need to meet a certain

06:43.200 --> 06:48.120
degree of certain amount of calories, you don't need to drink alcohol, hence it's always

06:48.120 --> 06:54.200
going to be central reasons.

06:54.200 --> 06:58.560
And even people say, I drink only because people around me pressure me to do so, that's

06:58.560 --> 07:04.880
also central reason, you're basically afraid of affecting adversely the central environment

07:04.880 --> 07:07.200
around you, you don't want to upset anyone.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.920
You don't want to have to be kind of ostracized or whatever by your friends or not, so you

07:11.920 --> 07:12.920
drink, it's ridiculous.

07:12.920 --> 07:17.440
You're trying to develop the strength of your mind, yet you're giving to the basic weaknesses

07:17.440 --> 07:25.320
of like, oh, they're laughing at their teasing me, so what?

07:25.320 --> 07:29.160
How can you be beyond suffering, beyond the favorite emotion when someone's mere teasing

07:29.160 --> 07:54.640
is affecting you, and you can't, you can't maintain your behavior, do you hear me?

07:54.640 --> 08:03.600
No, of course, it's a further ground.

08:03.600 --> 08:08.080
You can have all the further ground you want if you don't have the actual well cultivated

08:08.080 --> 08:17.040
seeds, and if you don't put the work in maintaining that soil, then they're not going to grow.

08:17.040 --> 08:21.400
Because you have to water it, you have to provide enough sun, you have to work around it

08:21.400 --> 08:29.080
once you plant the seeds, but just leaving, just hoping for the soil to do its only one,

08:29.080 --> 08:32.680
to do the work you want, it's just the soil.

08:32.680 --> 08:39.960
So you can have 300 rules, 1000 rules, 5 rules, as many rules as you want.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
Right.

08:40.960 --> 08:45.200
It doesn't, it doesn't matter because there's other work that needs to be done.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.360
Yeah, you need to have the rules that cover the necessary basis, and those are basically

08:50.360 --> 08:55.080
what is known as 8 presets, or 10 presets if you want to take it maybe a step further,

08:55.080 --> 08:56.080
but that's it.

08:56.080 --> 09:04.600
Everything else is derived from that basis, it cannot add more to it.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.480
So in that sense, yeah, having 3000 rules, it's not necessary.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.840
If you've covered the basis of these 8 presets, if you don't do anything unwholesome on

09:12.840 --> 09:16.280
the account of the 8 presets, that's it.

09:16.280 --> 09:21.960
You have sufficient basis for complete freedom, from suffering, from feelings, and anything

09:21.960 --> 09:22.960
else.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.720
What, what, what can you give up here?

09:26.720 --> 09:34.480
What's a basic, what's a basic set, preset, what's anybody can follow?

09:34.480 --> 09:36.240
Don't, right.

09:36.240 --> 09:45.840
Don't kill, don't steal, don't cheat, or preferably.

09:45.840 --> 09:56.120
Or ideally, be a completely celibate, leave a completely celibate lifestyle.

09:56.120 --> 10:06.040
Don't, well don't, sorry, yeah, don't drink and take drugs, in a sense of don't consume

10:06.040 --> 10:13.040
things that directly affect mindfulness and awareness and composure.

10:13.040 --> 10:21.960
So you have to, those are like the five basic ones, and they have to be basically taken

10:21.960 --> 10:22.960
seriously.

10:22.960 --> 10:27.920
And I'm talking about someone who still lives in the world, but for a month, then you

10:27.920 --> 10:38.240
have the 8 presets, you have the non-butification, non-indulgence in sleep, and not eating it

10:38.240 --> 10:45.280
the wrong times, as you not just spend the whole day eating around and thinking about food.

10:45.280 --> 10:52.960
So you want to start kind of harnessing your mind basically, harnessing the outposts,

10:52.960 --> 10:57.480
the behaviors of your mind that are founded upon desire and non-restraint.

10:57.480 --> 11:02.280
So basically, you're setting up a fence, tying it down, pinning it down until it comes

11:02.280 --> 11:03.280
down.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.200
That's what the presets are.

11:05.200 --> 11:09.960
But in itself, it's not enough.

11:09.960 --> 11:15.640
The necessary basis, the container, but then the work needs to be done within that.

11:15.640 --> 11:20.200
Once you fence the yard off for a wild horse, you need to start training it.

11:20.200 --> 11:26.720
Yeah, you can't start training it, inconceivable, when you can always run off into the mountains.

11:26.720 --> 11:32.480
But now you fence it off completely, you repair any patches that he was escaping through,

11:32.480 --> 11:35.080
you brought it back, now he can't escape.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.400
You wait for it to calm down, because he will calm down, sooner or later he's going

11:38.400 --> 11:40.960
to get tired of running around in circles.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.880
When it's calm, then you start training it.

11:43.880 --> 11:48.760
But then if you remove the fence and you haven't trained it, it's going to run off again.

11:48.760 --> 11:52.960
So you have to keep the fence until it's fully trained, and when it's fully trained,

11:52.960 --> 11:55.520
then it doesn't matter if the fence stays.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.240
And that's basically the definition of the presets.

11:57.240 --> 12:04.280
So even as a layperson, the five presets are a certain degree of that fence, which is

12:04.280 --> 12:09.200
a good thing, because you are taming down the wild horse, which what mind is really for

12:09.200 --> 12:11.000
most people.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.600
So you're taking a bit more control over your own behavior, over your own desires, over

12:15.600 --> 12:22.520
your own sort of impulses that you usually, you can't say no to.

12:22.520 --> 12:36.920
Yeah, that's the first step.
