1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So can a lay lifestyle lead to becoming an arahant?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,520
A lay lifestyle, no. No, that's impossible.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,520
The question, yeah, that's often asked, is can a layman be an arahant?

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,600
But that depends what's meant by layman. If you mean that somebody

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,440
is not a formal ordain, doesn't wear robes, then yes, a layman can become an

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:33,040
arahant. But if by a layman you mean by taking in the lifestyle of a layman,

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,640
living in company, still having concerns with the world,

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,040
living a household life, not being sensory-strained, that's impossible.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,920
So from that point of view, a layman cannot be an arahant.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,320
That's when the suit is a layman, as in a person not ordained in the big order,

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,920
but became an arahant. He wasn't a householder,

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,200
who became an arahant. He was a person who wasn't ordained, but wasn't living

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,440
as a householder either. So the most famous case is Bahia,

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,840
who himself was a naked, a buddhbhak ascetic. He was just waiting buddhbhak

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
to cover himself, and he was living very austerely,

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,000
mindfully, practicing for who knows how long, and he was so pure that

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
he himself thought he's fully enlightened. And then the devout of

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
compassion said, no, actually not fully enlightened, go and meet the Buddha.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,520
And that's the famous instruction where the Buddha, all he needed to say to him,

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
was in the scene, let there just be the scene, in the herd,

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,440
let there just be the herd, and so on, for all the senses.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,800
And he became an arahant. So technically he was a layman, he wasn't

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,680
he wasn't a monk, he wasn't an ordain, because then he asked the Buddha,

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
oh, can I join your order? He said, yeah, go and find the ball and the rope,

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,720
but then he got killed by a cow. So technically he was a layman who became

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,080
an arahant, but you realize he was far from

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,680
living a layman's life. He was basically a type of

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,360
summoner, an ascetic, just not ordained in the order.

29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,520
And often that's where the lines get blurred. People say, oh, so you don't

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,960
need to be a monk, as in you don't need to be formally ordained

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,800
to become an arahant, means I can live a household life

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,960
and become an arahant. No, you need to live like a monk.

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,080
Whether you wear robes and you're ordained formally or not, that doesn't

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,880
matter. But the lifestyle of somebody who has renounced the world,

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,600
who is sense-restraint, well, that matters, that is a necessary basis for it.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,240
While this constitutes a summoner, sense-restraint,

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,840
celibacy, seclusion, devoted to seclusion, as much as possible,

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,480
and not being engaged, preoccupied, concerned,

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,800
inspired by worldly affairs. So you might need to do some worldly

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
things to some extent, even as monks you have to.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
But that's one thing, doing it as like a chore

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,320
and doing it because you're still driven by it and you still want it and you

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,440
still desire towards it. So that must be abandoned.

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,600
So technically you can live a lay life, but

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,040
if you were able to live lay life, yet be so withdrawn from everything,

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,040
succeeding that, why don't you just become a monk? Nothing would stop you from

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,320
becoming a monk. So usually when somebody

48
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,040
doesn't become a monk, it's because something is still stopping them in the

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,880
world, which is a form of concern, and that in itself

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,480
is an impediment for if they want to be an arhat.

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,760
So one can go forth without ordaining?

52
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,880
Yes, but not because you feel like you've gone forth,

53
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,080
but because you actually became sort upon or higher.

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
And that's why the noble Arya Sangha in the Suttas

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
includes lay people, they were not monks, but they were actually

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,040
Aryas. And consequently one can go forth and

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,200
ordain and still be a householder in his mind.

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,600
So wearing robes is not a guarantee that you will,

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:13,120
that you are a Samana, that you have that distinction of a noble Sangha.
