1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
those within that and you pull it apart.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Of the random operation of all,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you can't even put your arms up.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's it.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You cannot see remaining alive.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So if the body, the material aspect, the flesh aspect,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the hoop bar gets deformed, destroyed,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
they cannot remain any consciousness in regard to it.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So that's how you recognize that then your eye,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
your nose, your ears are that ultimate away from you.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then you just have obviously been appropriate for so long,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and it's so close that you can't see it.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So then you just assume it's in you, it's yours,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and you have the result.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, it's kind of the expression of you, so to speak.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But if you start to see that when you think about the eye,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it's the certain expectation that they will find

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
a real eye somewhere else.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But you want.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thoughts you have about the eye are all you can have about the eye.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Because I myself, it's always going to be ultimate negative,

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and it doesn't appear.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So what appears is that because of which there is sort of appearance,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and that's determined by that eye.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So even when you think eye, you have to stop regarding that

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
as a real eye or as a non-real eye,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
or as both real and not real, you can just recognize,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can only have thoughts that stand in place of an eye.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And when I say an eye, that's another thought that stands

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in the place of an eye, which is another thought,

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
which is another thought.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So you can never access the eye.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You can only be a second sort of to it.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Whatever thought, whatever abstraction,

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
whatever is going to be secondary to it.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And that's all it's necessarily to recognize that

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
because then you see, oh, by being inaccessible,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you cannot even conceive ownership of it.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And Bande can you even access thoughts?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, exactly. Then if you start refining that principle further,

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I mean, it's relatively refined when it comes to body,

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
it's the same principle that comes to mind,

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but it's much harder to see, as the word has said, himself.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Because putution can get rid of the body.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So do, do, do, do, do.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If you extend the same principle,

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
then you realize that thoughts themselves,

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
in their nature arise on their own.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You sort of manage them, you intend upon them,

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
but that intention is secondary to the arising of thoughts.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thus, intention shares the same nature of,

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
cannot be owned.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Because it's founded upon things that are inaccessible to ownership.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And that's how the mind gets free from the suckness,

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
conceding, and becomes an utterance.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So then you can think and will, and still not own it,

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
while you're willing and thinking and deciding,

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and telling off, and whatever else,

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
what you do, you have to know about it in a way.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's the same principle, but it's much harder to see it

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
on the level of the mind,

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
but if you see it on the level of the body thoroughly,

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
then yes, it's far from impossible.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Because that's the whole point.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's, it's used spinning over,

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in the same sense that after all,

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that spills over the five aggregates, and owns them.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Once that's gone, well, then you still have perceptions

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
in regard to the sense basis that spills over,

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
that assume the access to the eye to the nose

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
hence the sensuality.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because the only benefit of central sides,

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that benefit can only pertain to the flesh eye.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Nothing else can benefit from sight.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Skin and the sense of touch can only benefit

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
from touching things.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You, you can't access that.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But by fully assuming access to the body,

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to the eyes, you have been drawn

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
by that which these things want.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So then you think you are accessing

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
all the external sensuality.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You are touching pleasant objects.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You are tasting pleasant sounds.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sorry, pleasant taste.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And you're hearing a grieble sound.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, ear is hearing the sound.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It cannot be different.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Eye is seeing the sights.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But you, when you say eye,

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
you assume the eye.

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hence, you are pulled by the sights.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So that's why the mindfulness,

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
this mindfulness I'm talking about,

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
peripheral, or letting in the ear is necessary

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
because you never see a connection

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
between your thoughts about the eye,

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
your sights, the lip.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And that indirect, fleshy organ

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that is simultaneously present

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
because of which all of this is possible,

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that in return defines that, which is an eye.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's why the sense base is defined

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
by the sense object.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
In itself, you can't even conceive.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The extent of it.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But if the mindfulness is developing

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the way we're talking, yes,

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
then you would be able to hold the thought

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
of the present organ of an eye

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
because of which I'm thinking of an eye

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and doing all of this without leapsing,

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
without either jumping too much

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
onto the external notion of the eyes

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
or thinking of, you know,

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
is this eyes in me, I am basically.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're able to see both ends

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
without kind of sort of snapping towards one,

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
if the mindfulness is developed

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to the extent necessary basically.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Like, you know, like a rubber band,

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
sort of you stretch yourself,

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
well, it's either going to sort of snap

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
from this end or from this end.

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You won't be able to kind of include both ends.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And both ends are included through development,

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
through discernment of enduring

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
endurance of the simultaneous theories

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and two things, right?

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Basically, it's a simultaneous present.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For that, you basically need mindfulness,

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
without mindfulness, you cannot do anything.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Just impossible.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because mindfulness does not necessarily bring knowledge

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
unless you know where you're supposed to know.

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But certainly, without it,

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
there is absolutely no basis for any discernment.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But if you already have discernment,

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
then all you need is the practice of mindfulness.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And satipatana is enough for somebody

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
who developed you.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's the only way that will lead to

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
full purification of the being

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and anything else.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Here's a good describe.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Because what else would lead to the full purification?

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, no, no.

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Then just sticking to that clear vision

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and developing it to the extent necessary.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What I've thought about from time

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
is the assumption of that something,

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think it's in context of what Nanda says,

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the eye is that in the world,

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
which my specific theory,

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
there is always a assumption that, you know,

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
there is vision,

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but there's also behind that.

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Sure.

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You assume that spatiality.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's what it ends up with.

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The assumption is the spatial kind of being.

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I am here and things are elsewhere.

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So you can't stop that.

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But when you do have such thoughts,

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you start including them

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
in that proper mindfulness of knowing

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
that all of that is possible

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
because there is the actual operating flesh of an eye.

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That you also know at the time

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
that you're thought in regard to it.

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But it's an accurate thought

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
because it doesn't consume it anymore

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:37,000
as that hidden entity in the hidden place.

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In my mind,

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
because if I was studying Nanda here,

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
it's kind of the explanation of the body

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and that's one letter we're doing in the height of it,

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
it's kind of things.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And that's the thing

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that we've given first experience of the whole.

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And then within that,

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you discern that here and the younger people

183
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
prioritize the here and the younger that are seeing there.

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, and then when they think of there,

185
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
they think in some terms

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
of like a third of the younger,

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
they think of that level.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Instead of seeing that both are possible

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
because there is already there.

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And that's the basis of an unknown that there.

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's it to get so off

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and this can seem too pretty.

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, very neat.

194
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's possible to see.

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You can see it.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah.

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Thanks for my hot seat method.

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We need you to, I remember.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And you're according to the sutra.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And by using as a breathing,

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
watching, watching breaths,

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you can, you know that the body is there.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is, this breath is happening.

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah.

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can.

207
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's why the body, the breathing is,

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
it's kind of symptomatic.

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's bound with body.

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's just inconceivable,

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
one without the other.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It can't feel.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The body is there.

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The breathing is there.

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The breathing is there.

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The body is there.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But they're not the same thing.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah.

220
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then that body.

221
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It is just looking at one aspect of the body.

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, the breathing is there,

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
then that body can be manifested as the body,

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
as the healing, as the thoughts are,

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
as any other thing,

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
within the principle of two symptoms,

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
they need to present things,

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
while you're breathing.

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

230
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So you can focus on the body aspect of breathing.

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But still not see the actual relationship.

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But yeah.

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But you can keep focusing on that breath,

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but you've got to see that relationship.

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's why it's there.

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's a successful body.

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

239
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's completely unnecessary to be focusing on anything.

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But yeah.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It actually takes your way.

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah.

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But just, you can use the breath as one of those things.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can just...

246
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Stereas.

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Stereas.

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They're breathing at once.

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

250
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's like the intention to bring in a mindfulness

251
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
in the actual,

252
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
or actual breathing.

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah.

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And if you look at the intention to breathe so much,

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
the intention is there.

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

257
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But this particular...

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Miles.

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

261
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And so it's beyond mind control.

262
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Or this...

263
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This...

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Pleasurable.

265
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Experience.

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Breath.

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
By the presence of this.

269
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The feeling of this.

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

271
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The feeling of this.

272
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What is that?

273
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah.

274
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah. That's how you start including your volition.

275
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But that's volition.

276
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And it doesn't start introducing the ignorance.

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Because volition usually comes from the center.

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So it feels...

279
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So when we will,

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
we engage in the center self.

281
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But I choose to breathe slowly,

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
because I think that's already there.

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's actually to give a possibility,

284
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
based on the simultaneously present and breathing.

285
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's possible.

286
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So you...

287
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I choose to...

288
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And then you realize that I choose to...

289
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's already because of that.

290
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So then you stop it here and do it.

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
As mine.

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's fiction.

293
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I went from my mind to this.

294
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
When you say, like,

295
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
there is control and a lack of control.

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think I can choose how to...

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I can choose how to breathe.

299
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The old thing, I can't choose.

300
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And the breathing is possible.

301
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

302
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And when you fully get rid of the slightest assumption

303
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
of control outside of the lack of control

304
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to a tiny degree or something,

305
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
then you fully stop the assumption

306
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
of an external entity that controls it.

307
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But it seems that that agent said that

308
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
there is not necessarily for this sense of self.

309
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because it can be completely paralyzed

310
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and still consider you're willing to be...

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're willing.

312
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

313
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The will of the mind.

314
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's ultimately mind.

315
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Speak fully.

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's how the will of life is.

317
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's why the action,

318
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
the three-time selection.

319
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So you can be paralyzed,

320
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
but it can still be very much willing.

321
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ah-ha.

322
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Having a mind,

323
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and perpetuating the same type of mistake.

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Just to the self.

325
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But it just won't plan anything.

326
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Sure.

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Because as this stops being usable,

328
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
because it can't.

329
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But it still won this early.

330
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's why a parallel expression

331
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
does not automatically become an error.

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah.

333
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because you remain ignorant

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
just on a different level now.

335
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You cannot express your ignorance

336
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
in a bodily way in the past.

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But if you want to speak...

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If you want to move their eyes

339
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and procreate that.

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Sure.

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Even if the only thing you say,

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you lose everything.

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You won't result in the bond.

344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You will result in the rebirth of another

345
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
being affecting the religion.

346
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So you need to do that while you are alive.

347
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Get the mind out of that.

348
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Self-centrements are discrete.

349
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That sense of error.

350
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And then the river can also affect you.

351
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Even this is suicide.

352
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You can't actually kill.

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You can't.

354
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes, so for an argument.

355
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Like for example, he can't kill himself.

356
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah.

357
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Only acts.

358
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's sort of...

359
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
is to prevent body from trying to exist.

360
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But that's not a suicide.

361
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Suicide is when the self-centre person

362
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
well, attention to kill himself.

363
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And kill themselves by killing the body.

364
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah.

365
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because you can't kill yourself directly.

366
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can just kill your body

367
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and then you wait for death to come.

368
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, that's what it is.

369
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can just make the body dysfunctional.

370
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But then the death of the body

371
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
comes from the complete direction

372
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
of you and you don't have access to it.

373
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, sure.

374
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Like you don't even...

375
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, exactly.

376
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's why you kill the body

377
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
hoping that that will result in death

378
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
because that's what you see in heavens.

379
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But when death does come,

380
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it doesn't come from the way of...

381
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you kill the body.

382
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It comes from the way of the mind.

383
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's what that is.

384
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It comes from way behind.

385
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So let's speak.

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's what conclusions are always swept

387
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
with the death.

388
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Like always swept through the flood.

389
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Swept.

390
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean, it just comes from behind

391
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and takes you where you're going to see it.

392
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But for another one who has developed

393
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that direction of death,

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
that direction of...

395
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
not adhering to anything,

396
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
seeing... seeing impermanence

397
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and everything, basically,

398
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
seeing that nothing is his,

399
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
when things do get swept away,

400
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
he's not there to be swept with it.

401
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And he has absolutely

402
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
inconceivable to fear death

403
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:58,000
because it's not death for him.

404
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You think it is as we can try,

405
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
but because it's...

406
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And I think that's what you work

407
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and show their last...

408
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
however...

409
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
A terrible problem.

410
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.

411
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And also, yeah, that's another assumption

412
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
that, you know, when you see somebody,

413
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know,

414
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
they're shocked in the head

415
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and anything at their dead.

416
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Their body is gone

417
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
in terms of its functionality.

418
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But from their point of view,

419
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
mentally, death,

420
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
might be lasting much, much longer.

421
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Once the body is killed,

422
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that's what death sets.

423
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And we all assume,

424
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
automatically,

425
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
based on the observation

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that it's instantaneous.

427
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But whenever the Buddha wants

428
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
to emphasize that,

429
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
that the extensive pains,

430
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
he would say,

431
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
pains like those of dying

432
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
or death.

433
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And then he would say,

434
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
oh, okay, yeah.

435
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Probably it's one thing

436
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
that body dies instantaneously.

437
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And once that happens,

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
then the experience of death begins.

439
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And it's horrible.

440
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Respect for the mind that...

441
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's here.

442
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It looks at the mass of your life.

443
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
There is the feeling that

444
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
you're living with breathing,

445
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and there is another feeling

446
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
that you're living with the body.

447
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Right.

448
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah, I don't remember that.

449
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But you still breathing,

450
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
but still alive.

451
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Right, right, right, right.

452
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, sure.

453
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Sure, sure.

454
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I feel of feeling terminated

455
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
of life first and then.

456
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, you're right.

457
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're right.

458
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're right.

459
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're right.

460
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Are you?

461
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes, you're right.

462
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, they're very, very good.

463
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And then this life itself.

464
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And that's the one that can last

465
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
for probably quite a while.

466
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay, imagine part of your brain

467
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
something on the floor,

468
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and still feeling...

469
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So you have been sort of withdrawn

470
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
from, because it was destroyed,

471
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the past six cents a base.

472
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Except, you don't have these

473
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
excesses anymore.

474
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

475
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Of eyes, nose, and stuff.

476
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Now, you're just being sort of

477
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
crushed from everywhere, basically.

478
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The mind is dying in itself, down here.

479
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And, you know, there's another suit

480
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
where it says, like, that the suit

481
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
upon a based on his insight,

482
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
he can become an other hunt.

483
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Again, that's commentary

484
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
at the moment of death,

485
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
like the mind moment of death.

486
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The moment of death,

487
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
it's the extent of the experience of death

488
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
that can endure.

489
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
For how long?

490
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Well, you don't know.

491
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah.

492
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So sort of going to keep you coming

493
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
out of hand during that time,

494
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
which now, when you think about it,

495
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
makes sense, actually.

496
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Because it's all instantaneous.

497
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's a period of complete,

498
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
crushing destruction of the five

499
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
upgrades that he has full understanding of.

500
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What's going to result in full dispassion?

501
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
There is nowhere for him to adhere

502
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
to distract himself from.

503
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
All he has left is his right view.

504
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So he can easily become an other hunt

505
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
in the moment of death.

506
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He said, if he doesn't become an

507
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
other hunt while he's dying, basically.

508
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Mentally, he can become an

509
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
other hunt while he's in interval.

510
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
When he's neither there nor born yet.

511
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Then he can become an

512
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
other hunt.

513
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The third type is upon landing.

514
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That was a translation.

515
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And he can become an other hunt

516
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
in that next life,

517
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
or then eventually in the seven lives.

518
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So you realize it's not seven.

519
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He can become an other hunt in any time.

520
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Up to seven.

521
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah, up to seven.

522
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But these kind of intervals

523
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
in between, and stuff,

524
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you realize this whole notion of

525
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm alive, I'm alive.

526
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The moment of death, I'm born again,

527
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
die, born again.

528
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The interval can be an event

529
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
before you're born again.

530
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hence the sense of urgency.

531
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You have no idea how long you'll be dying.

532
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You've had a very long time.

533
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There is that kind of assumption

534
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that it's like, you know,

535
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
like people speculate about

536
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
like reverence,

537
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
like someone died in 1973.

538
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Even born in 1973.

539
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It might have been the rebirth

540
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
of that person.

541
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Sure.

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No, it's fully based

543
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
on a gratuitous,

544
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
based on an external perception

545
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
of death,

546
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the kind of just switching of the body.

547
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's it.

548
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Because that's all you can see.

549
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And you never experience

550
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
yourself differently

551
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
to be able to tell

552
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
that actually it's not just that.

553
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, it's in the similar way

554
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
like it's being born.

555
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You cannot really say

556
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
when the person is born.

557
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You can't say that.

558
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You can't.

559
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You only know that someone

560
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
is pregnant

561
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and then somebody comes out.

562
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And consciousness is already pregnant.

563
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Because imagine like

564
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
in a medical school, you know,

565
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
like in a Czech Republic,

566
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the abortion is legal up to three months.

567
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah, it's the usual.

568
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But imagine if it's actually

569
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
it's a real human being.

570
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It is.

571
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And you are just the whole life

572
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
sitting down as a doctor.

573
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The thing is,

574
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
that the Chinese friend of yours,

575
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
yeah, he must have it.

576
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But the thing is like,

577
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
even though, say,

578
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
even if you're not,

579
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
because the Buddha said

580
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
when the human being

581
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
does kind of descend,

582
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
which is when embryo is born.

583
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

584
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So already the conceiving of embryo

585
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
means conceiving of life.

586
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yes.

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
They dismiss that because

588
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
it's just an embryo,

589
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
it's a cell.

590
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So they can arbitrarily decide,

591
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
or three months,

592
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
it's a however,

593
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
even when you do abortion of a fetus

594
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
or for one month or two,

595
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
you are cutting a body inside.

596
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's how they do abortion.

597
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You start chopping it inside

598
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and then pulling parts

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
two months.

600
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So it's not a fetus form,

601
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
yet you still see

602
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
little arms and stuff.

603
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Or recognize,

604
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
this is an arm.

605
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This would have been an arm

606
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
in a week.

607
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's already an arm.

608
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So even people who kind of

609
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
medically sort of thought

610
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
that you have a certain

611
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
heavy amount of denial

612
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
that this is just,

613
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
this is not the way

614
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
being I'm killing.

615
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's after the third month

616
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
that it becomes alive.

617
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's completely stupid.

618
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's terrible.

619
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think they focus on the,

620
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you know,

621
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
it's the one,

622
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
like we were giving women

623
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the choice aspect.

624
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Sure.

625
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They focus on like,

626
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
oh, this is my job.

627
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I just do that.

628
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's on my phone.

629
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

630
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Where they give their justifications

631
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
of, oh, you know, this person

632
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
with great tiredness,

633
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
pregnantness,

634
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
immoral kind of abortion.

635
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

636
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You can even kind of

637
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
sympathize with it almost.

638
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah.

639
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But you can be quite a serious

640
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
killer.

641
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'd be like,

642
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
a hundred and a hundred.

643
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So, yeah.

644
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah.

645
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Boy, Chinese children.

646
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
They're one child.

647
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
They're one child policy.

648
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah.

649
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And the story.

650
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So you imagine how many they

651
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
get pregnant a second time?

652
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah.

653
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
She was doing like,

654
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
in the height of some days,

655
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
or something,

656
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
ridiculous, like,

657
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I have a memory of saying

658
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
thirty in one day.

659
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Thirty a day.

660
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They say it was ten.

661
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And in a month.

662
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You can say,

663
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
you killed 300 people.

664
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Imagine that coming.

665
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And she said,

666
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
she would sleep at night

667
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and just have,

668
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
with visions of,

669
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
after one,

670
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
blood.

671
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Right.

672
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And this.

673
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
She said, no,

674
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
but it's okay.

675
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Because they do it

676
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
chanting after.

677
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So all the notes,

678
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
as they get together,

679
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
for each mother,

680
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
who's chanting.

681
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Like, somebody's chanting

682
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and they go,

683
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
what's next?

684
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But they know.

685
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Very well.

686
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Like, this is something

687
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
wrong.

688
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's why they're chanting.

689
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah.

690
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's why they're chanting.

691
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

692
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's why they're chanting.

693
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah.

694
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So, you're singing about

695
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
300 people.

696
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Thousands, thousands.

697
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
One after a year.

698
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah.

699
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, it's quite.

700
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And the Christians

701
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
in America,

702
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
some,

703
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
wrongly,

704
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
but they still recognize it.

705
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's not a good thing

706
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
that they go too far.

707
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They would kill the abortion.

708
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, they killed the doctors.

709
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm reading about it.

711
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You get the bombings

712
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
of it instead.

713
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
She was.

714
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
In the name of God's moral

715
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
will forever.

716
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
There it is.

717
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And there it is.

718
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Get all the more.

719
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But it is, it is a,

720
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
it is a useful reflection as

721
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
well,

722
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to stop associating death

723
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
with the death of the body.

724
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And see something that comes

725
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
from the ultimate inside,

726
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
so to speak.

727
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You can't,

728
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
in the same sense,

729
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
you can't conceive,

730
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the sense organs,

731
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the direction you can't access

732
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
them,

733
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
you're just because of them.

734
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Well, death

735
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
speaks them.

736
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It means you have no,

737
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
you can't,

738
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
you can't have a relationship

739
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
with death,

740
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
because it doesn't come

741
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
from any direction

742
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
that you can possibly conceive.

743
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But you can also, basically,

744
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you should,

745
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
basically we should say that,

746
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you know, because it's

747
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
now my Rupa,

748
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
it goes together,

749
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
they die together.

750
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So even if you like,

751
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
say the bullet comes

752
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
or goes through your head.

753
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah, that's not the only Rupa.

754
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But there is the particular,

755
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
other parts of the body,

756
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
which I would say.

757
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You don't have any parts of the body.

758
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
There is a body.

759
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

760
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
On the basis of the general Rupa.

761
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
On the basis of which,

762
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
they give you a consciousness.

763
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah.

764
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So when this body is destroyed,

765
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
that's, there wasn't your body

766
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
upon which you were really existing.

767
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
There was just a more particular

768
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
manifestation of the form

769
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
upon which your consciousness was existing.

770
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's where you can transcend your body.

771
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You can fly out of your body.

772
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And that's why,

773
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
if you die with ignorance,

774
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
you get another body.

775
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You get another particular manifestation

776
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
of the same form.

777
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So that's another important thing.

778
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The form that you depend upon now,

779
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
where you're bound with Rupa,

780
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
is the same one.

781
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You depend upon previous life,

782
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and previous life,

783
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and previous life,

784
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and previous life.

785
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Despite having different bodies

786
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and different particular forms,

787
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
the nature of the five aggregates

788
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
remains the same.

789
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And the Buddha said that,

790
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
even if a monk recollects one past life,

791
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
he'll 500 of them,

792
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
or he recollects,

793
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
is these five aggregates,

794
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
or one among them more particularly.

795
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But that's it.

796
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That always remains the base.

797
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And that's it, because again,

798
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
people think,

799
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
this is a journey.

800
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You're just passing

801
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
from this life into the known.

802
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This is always what's present,

803
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
has always been present.

804
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
In that other sense,

805
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
the five aggregates.

806
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That's why you keep remaining,

807
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
being born.

808
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Not because you keep traveling,

809
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
because you keep holding on to the same thing.

810
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So now,

811
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
the stuff you're holding,

812
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
is the stuff you've been holding,

813
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
beginninglessly,

814
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
for billions of years of time.

815
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And it's right here,

816
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
right now,

817
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
can be freed from.

818
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
In that sense,

819
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
it's a calica.

820
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But again, people have the linear assumption

821
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
of death,

822
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
rebirth, elsewhere,

823
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and this,

824
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and it's a journey,

825
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and you come to know,

826
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
it's right there.

827
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That's why, if you stop associating death

828
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
with that kind of movement,

829
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
you realize,

830
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
ah, death, basically,

831
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
death doesn't take away the five aggregates.

832
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It takes away your dependence

833
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
upon the particular manifestation of the senses

834
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
of the five aggregates and so on.

835
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So what you have to do to be free from death,

836
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
but really,

837
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
is free yourself from your senses,

838
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and then eventually,

839
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
from the conceit in regard to the ideas,

840
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and you'll be free from death,

841
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and you'll be free from rebirth.

842
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
From this very same present principle

843
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
that we were talking about,

844
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
of mindfulness and simultaneous presence.

845
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's not, you know,

846
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
above it,

847
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
or below, or later,

848
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
or before.

849
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And that's how you cannot possibly

850
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
be affected when illness affects the body,

851
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
breaking apart,

852
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
death,

853
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
loss of limbs,

854
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
loss of senses,

855
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
which is,

856
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:19,000
because you are not in that particular manifestation of it, you know.

857
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That's why I also,

858
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
when we were talking about it,

859
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
there were the madness.

860
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Like,

861
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
if the body starts

862
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
losing the balances

863
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and doing things that are not,

864
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
the weird is that,

865
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
you wouldn't have personal problem with it,

866
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
because it's not yours.

867
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
If there was wisdom,

868
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
there was knowledge properly established,

869
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
you just, like,

870
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
without a jar like,

871
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
oh, honey,

872
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
you're actually not making sense.

873
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You stopped engaging in that kind of outlet or speech.

874
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's not,

875
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
it's not yours to begin with,

876
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
so it's not an issue.

877
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So you couldn't possibly be denying it

878
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
or having a problem with it,

879
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
if everybody says,

880
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
oh, that's, that's, yeah,

881
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:05,000
yeah, that's how this body is acting now.

882
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And can this happen to other half?

883
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Well, I think that,

884
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
well, like, say,

885
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
loses mind,

886
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
how do you,

887
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
how do you,

888
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
look like a mad person?

889
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I think theoretically,

890
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
it could,

891
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
yeah,

892
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
but that doesn't mean,

893
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
what,

894
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
what it can never be compromised,

895
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
like externally,

896
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
he could be mad,

897
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and say that man disappears

898
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and people tell him he was mad,

899
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
yeah,

900
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
he would probably already know that,

901
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and he wouldn't have an issue,

902
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
again, same with other child,

903
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
he didn't realize

904
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
because of the stroke,

905
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
he was thinking one thing,

906
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
he was thinking he was saying one thing,

907
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
he was saying something completely different,

908
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
completely,

909
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
but there should be,

910
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
like,

911
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
in that I had some emotions

912
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
should be missing,

913
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
like fear or,

914
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
all of that is missing.

915
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
He cannot be afraid,

916
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
he cannot suffer,

917
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
he's absolutely fine,

918
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
because he's not afraid of death.

919
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
He's not afraid of death.

920
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
How can you be afraid of losing

921
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
the speech mind

922
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and bodily activities?

923
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
He cannot be his concern.

924
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, he cannot lose,

925
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
is that purified,

926
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
freed point of view?

927
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So even if madness

928
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
becomes his reality,

929
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
basically,

930
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
but even that reality

931
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
is equally affected

932
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
with non-Avija,

933
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
he's fully understood.

934
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So he might not be able

935
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
to express it anymore

936
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
because the speech is

937
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
slurring,

938
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
the chemicals in brain,

939
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
they were helping perception,

940
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
just don't work anymore,

941
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
just perceiving things differently,

942
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and stuff.

943
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
There is his reality.

944
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But still, he would not engage

945
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
like an animal,

946
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
some activities,

947
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
basically,

948
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
attacking people

949
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
or being aggressive

950
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
or disfigured.

951
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He would be just mad,

952
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and...

953
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What is it?

954
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It depends.

955
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I don't know.

956
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Because aggressive behavior

957
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
is not necessarily

958
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
the sign of real will.

959
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah.

960
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But the more serious issue,

961
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
it's not aggressive behavior,

962
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
it's denial

963
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
of when these things

964
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
were pointed out,

965
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
it's that kind of almost

966
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
conceited refusal.

967
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
No.

968
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I cannot get mad.

969
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm not mad.

970
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That's an issue.

971
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yes.

972
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Even if he was punching people

973
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
in the face before that,

974
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
then we're not necessarily

975
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
being an issue.

976
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
In the same sense,

977
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
there was that other hand

978
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
who was like,

979
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
oops.

980
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Like the whole province

981
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
got upset in monks

982
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
because he was rude,

983
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
really abrasive,

984
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
telling people off,

985
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
just calling other monks,

986
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
shavelings,

987
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
just horrible,

988
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and people complained

989
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
to the Buddha.

990
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And they would have called them.

991
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
He was a big issue,

992
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and then the Buddha

993
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
saw he was actually an

994
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
other hand,

995
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
fully enlightened.

996
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But he was reborn,

997
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
he had the habit,

998
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
basically.

999
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
He was reborn like

1000
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
over 500 lifetimes

1001
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
in a high ground in February.

1002
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But I think he was not

1003
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
so rude actually.

1004
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I read that story.

1005
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
He was only called them

1006
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
like a...

1007
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Well, no.

1008
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's what the story

1009
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
would always condense

1010
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
the meaning as he called

1011
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
them shavelings.

1012
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But you can imagine,

1013
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
if the point came

1014
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
when the whole area

1015
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
complained to the Buddha,

1016
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and the Buddha had to call

1017
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
him for that.

1018
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Like, he wouldn't

1019
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
have like one man

1020
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
got upset.

1021
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You call him in sharing

1022
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and then the Buddha

1023
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
saw on him and said,

1024
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
no, he was a big issue

1025
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
because he was going

1026
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
around doing it.

1027
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes.

1028
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And people said,

1029
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
no, the kind of monk

1030
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
is that.

1031
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So you can extrapolate,

1032
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
relatively accurately,

1033
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
that actually was probably

1034
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
many ways.

1035
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But then the Buddha said,

1036
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
no, he was just

1037
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
he was used to talking

1038
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
down to people.

1039
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But I can't understand.

1040
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But he was doing it

1041
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
without a real will.

1042
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
How he can punch

1043
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
someone in the face of the

1044
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Buddha.

1045
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
No, I just said that in theory.

1046
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
No, no, no.

1047
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Like, you madness.

1048
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Like, you really,

1049
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
you don't, the way your

1050
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
perception goes messed up

1051
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
with the chemicals

1052
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
in your brain and

1053
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
everything else,

1054
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
you don't necessarily perceive

1055
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
him as a human anymore.

1056
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And you hit him.

1057
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh.

1058
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Hit it.

1059
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And then afterwards,

1060
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
they tell you,

1061
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
you punched this monk

1062
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
in the face.

1063
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You would not be denying.

1064
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That's my whole heart.

1065
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yes.

1066
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Like a transparent person,

1067
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
which is the basis of

1068
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
wisdom, transparency,

1069
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
is mindfulness,

1070
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
will not be denying it.

1071
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Even if the most horrible

1072
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
stuff, so to speak,

1073
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
you wouldn't be able to

1074
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
deny it.

1075
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yes.

1076
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And you wouldn't have a

1077
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
reason to deny it,

1078
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because it's not personal.

1079
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes.

1080
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's not personal.

1081
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yes.

1082
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's why,

1083
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
that's why you wouldn't,

1084
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
you know, you don't have,

1085
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
that's our heart,

1086
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
is as in private,

1087
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
so in public,

1088
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
in terms of his behavior.

1089
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
He has no, like,

1090
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
oh, this is really good.

1091
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You know, when people

1092
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
sometimes are that

1093
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
regard personally,

1094
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
some weird stuff.

1095
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's actually so big

1096
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
about it.

1097
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's nothing personal.

1098
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Like, you need to hide

1099
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
about it.

1100
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Why would you be hiding that?

1101
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yes.

1102
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And most people do.

1103
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Most people,

1104
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
like, like,

1105
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
lay people out there,

1106
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
have a lot of stuff

1107
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
like that.

1108
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yes.

1109
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That it's kind of, you know,

1110
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
why?

1111
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Because it's taken personally.

1112
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That's the sole reason.

1113
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So that's more of an issue.

1114
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yes.

1115
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Not the actual

1116
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
manifestation of behavior,

1117
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
because you know,

1118
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
even in the,

1119
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
in the rules,

1120
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
often,

1121
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
if somebody is possessed

1122
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
with the madness,

1123
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
he's exempted.

1124
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Exactly.

1125
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah.

1126
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Which means he could have done

1127
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
serious offenses,

1128
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
but he was a genuine

1129
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
madness.

1130
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah.

1131
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Means he wasn't his

1132
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
intention of doing.

1133
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That's funny.

1134
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, except, say, if he does

1135
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
something like

1136
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
women, rapes,

1137
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
rapes of women,

1138
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
that is.

1139
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
He's not purergic,

1140
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
because he needs

1141
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
a man.

1142
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He's completely mad,

1143
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
yeah.

1144
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
His last thought,

1145
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
sense of, like,

1146
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
so his point of view

1147
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
was not involved.

1148
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yeah.

1149
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So to speak,

1150
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
his individual was not

1151
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
possessed.

1152
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But,

1153
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
if when that's done,

1154
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
he's just this full-on,

1155
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
you know,

1156
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
rude or aggressive denial,

1157
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and like,

1158
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
no, no,

1159
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
high and beyond all of that,

1160
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
then he's just like,

1161
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
well, not that.

1162
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Now, that's not

1163
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
meant speaking,

1164
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
because it shows,

1165
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
basically, some

1166
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
thinking is done.

1167
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
At some notion,

1168
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
at some idea of yourself,

1169
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and that's the definition

1170
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
of conceit.

1171
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I don't know.

1172
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Well, even if you say,

1173
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
you know,

1174
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
like people say,

1175
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
you're mad,

1176
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
you can't agree

1177
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
on the terminology,

1178
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
well, I wasn't mad,

1179
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
he was yak as possessed,

1180
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
my mind.

1181
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Who's made me see those things?

1182
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But if people say,

1183
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
well, yeah,

1184
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
you were mad,

1185
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
you wouldn't be arguing the

1186
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
point.

1187
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Okay, yeah.

1188
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That's how you can

1189
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
call madness, sure.

1190
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But he wasn't.

1191
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
He doesn't affect

1192
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
your personal image,

1193
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
unless there is an

1194
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
image that you hope

1195
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
personally.

1196
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah.

1197
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah, he was

1198
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
shitting,

1199
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
pissing himself,

1200
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that's the whole point.

1201
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The point

1202
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
of being yours.

1203
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Because, you know,

1204
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
it can happen to anyone

1205
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
anytime.

1206
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah.

1207
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Absolutely.

1208
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm not sure that

1209
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
tomorrow you will not

1210
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Well, always,

1211
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
you get that

1212
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
cephalitis,

1213
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and you start

1214
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
really turning into

1215
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
completely different person.

1216
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But your point of view,

1217
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
can ever go down

1218
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
if he has the

1219
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
relevant wisdom,

1220
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
because it's independent

1221
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
of the content,

1222
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
of the quickness

1223
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
of the intellect.

1224
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That's what my opponent

1225
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
says.

1226
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You can be, you can

1227
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
become stupid,

1228
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
you can have a stroke,

1229
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
you can also think,

1230
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and that dimension,

1231
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
you know,

1232
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
remains completely

1233
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
unaffected.

1234
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Yeah.

1235
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Because if I was,

1236
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
you know, being rough

1237
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
as people in my 30

1238
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
years of my life,

1239
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
maybe before that,

1240
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,000
it had a

1241
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
strong,

1242
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
but then, you know,

1243
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
okay, I can't

1244
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
down with it,

1245
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I can't mind it.

1246
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And these things

1247
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
got, you know,

1248
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
they got

1249
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
something in mind that

1250
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
had my team back in.

1251
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Sure.

1252
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Because it's been done

1253
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
much longer.

1254
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Okay.

1255
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah.

1256
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
That's just the way it's

1257
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
been.

1258
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
But as I said,

1259
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
the point of view

1260
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that has been purified,

1261
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
that it has no

1262
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
will there,

1263
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
or lost around

1264
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
it.

1265
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes.

1266
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Is the relationship

1267
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
of, like, with the eyes,

1268
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
for example, you know,

1269
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I can think of,

1270
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
an image of my eye,

1271
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
kind of thing.

1272
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I assume it applies

1273
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
just at a much more

1274
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
subtle level

1275
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
to the monolendama

1276
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
that gives me

1277
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
a monolendama.

1278
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You can think of

1279
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
some vague

1280
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
notion of what

1281
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
is my,

1282
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
like,

1283
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
it's a sense

1284
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
of an image of a brain.

1285
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Well, my

1286
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
there's a sense

1287
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
where it's defined by

1288
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
the dharma that you're

1289
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
thinking.

1290
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So it's a negative

1291
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
in regard to that particular

1292
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
thing.

1293
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So it's, yeah,

1294
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it's the same.

1295
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So then, when you do have a

1296
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
thought about the negative

1297
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
particular thing,

1298
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
but you realize that there is

1299
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
a negative in particular

1300
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that thought.

1301
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So you want to make sure

1302
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that the thought

1303
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
about your mind,

1304
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
itself, as,

1305
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
actually, this is

1306
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
what the mind is.

1307
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm mind,

1308
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and this,

1309
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
you don't confuse

1310
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
yourself that you're

1311
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
thinking about,

1312
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
because it's

1313
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
another thought.

1314
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Exactly.

1315
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So that's what you have

1316
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
to do.

1317
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's not like to figure it

1318
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
out,

1319
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
or to catch it,

1320
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
just to stop

1321
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
misconceiving it.

1322
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's the whole point

1323
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
of the whole monolabarianism.

1324
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So maybe we can only say

1325
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
that mind is only that

1326
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
which can think

1327
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
thoughts.

1328
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That's exactly why,

1329
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
yeah, that's why

1330
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
you can free your mind

1331
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
because it's there

1332
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
anyway, anyhow,

1333
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
on its own,

1334
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
by itself,

1335
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
that's exactly the reason

1336
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
why you can

1337
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
equilibrate it.

1338
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's like, you know,

1339
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
if you can, you know,

1340
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
you can kind of say

1341
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
that anyone, you know,

1342
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
is here,

1343
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
things are yonder,

1344
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
like, yeah, sure,

1345
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
but then you go

1346
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
to the mind,

1347
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and they kind of

1348
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,000
just assume it's all

1349
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
true.

1350
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
There is no yonder

1351
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
in the mind.

1352
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah, that's the confusion

1353
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
really.

1354
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Stop.

1355
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
They're thinking

1356
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
at that level.

1357
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah.

1358
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But they're here

1359
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
and yonder in the mind,

1360
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
too.

1361
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah.

1362
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You need more negative

1363
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
to anything else in the sense

1364
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
of it.

1365
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
That's why you can

1366
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
see if the

1367
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
thinker,

1368
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
like, you can see the

1369
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
seeer, you can see

1370
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the hearer.

1371
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And that's exactly why,

1372
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
even if your senses

1373
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
are taken away from you,

1374
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
they're conceived to the

1375
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
remains.

1376
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This is perhaps

1377
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
going a little bit

1378
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
away from, you know,

1379
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
a dama principle

1380
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
thing.

1381
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But I think it's

1382
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
interesting and important

1383
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
to think about just

1384
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
because of how

1385
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
often it's brought up,

1386
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
is, you know,

1387
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
the mind,

1388
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
it's not to say it, like, you

1389
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
know, people

1390
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
are studying neuro

1391
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
chemistry, great.

1392
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But it's not to say

1393
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that it's like,

1394
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
there is no

1395
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
effect on particular things

1396
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
because of things

1397
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
in the range

1398
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that people go

1399
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
to far and assume that

1400
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
else is just a

1401
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
manifestation of the

1402
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
brain.

1403
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
People go to far

1404
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
basically and then

1405
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
they describe their

1406
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
point of view and their

1407
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
responsibility to that

1408
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
in the brain.

1409
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And that's not the

1410
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
case.

1411
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The results, the

1412
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
chemicals in the brain

1413
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
can present you

1414
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
with things.

1415
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But it's a new

1416
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
basically to keep maintaining

1417
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
ignorance in regard to

1418
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
the reason things

1419
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
or knowledge in regard

1420
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
to the same.

1421
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Same with the eye,

1422
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
it is, it is, it is,

1423
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
then chemicals

1424
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
in hormones.

1425
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

1426
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But people say that

1427
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
as if, like, oh,

1428
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
it's because of it,

1429
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
nothing has

1430
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
happened.

1431
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah.

1432
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We say that

1433
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
correlation is not

1434
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
causation.

1435
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Cozation.

1436
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah.

1437
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's definitely

1438
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
correlated.

1439
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I was thinking back

1440
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
the days when I

1441
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
used to take antidepressants

1442
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
things.

1443
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah.

1444
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I can kind of say I

1445
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
just, like, things presented

1446
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
themselves, you know, perhaps

1447
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
more pleasing way

1448
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and fundamentally do

1449
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
anything.

1450
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
No, exactly.

1451
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Exactly.

1452
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Exactly.

1453
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
That's why you can't

1454
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
treat depression

1455
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
as a state of mind.

1456
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah.

1457
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah.

1458
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So then you can make

1459
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
choices.

1460
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
They will take you out

1461
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
of depression.

1462
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But that's not how

1463
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
my business presented.

1464
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's presented as treatment

1465
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
all such and such states.

1466
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And you can't do that.

1467
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
One last one for me,

1468
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
is this, because I've read it

1469
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
so many times, and I just

1470
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
never really

1471
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
entered it.

1472
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
There's a lot of times

1473
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
in the suitors, or it's

1474
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
like that, but I've

1475
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
mentioned that he and his

1476
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
disciples, like, they

1477
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
don't get arguments

1478
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
in quarrels in terms of

1479
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:37,000
in terms of views and stuff like that, especially in the new suit and hip-hop, the transition that comes up a lot like, you know, I'm gaining and disputes and stuff.

1480
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm having trouble, like, I guess, understanding that, what are the same to understand that there is right things and wrong things.

1481
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:59,000
No, that refers to his disciples, which means he refers to the noble disciples. So that's the point, basically.

1482
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
They might be disagreeing in a particular explanation or description of something.

1483
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But fundamentally, if these two people both are taking the right view, they will have to agree.

1484
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So it's like an internal, that external kind of thing.

1485
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Well, no, even externally, it cannot result in an external, you know what I'm saying?

1486
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Like, not getting into, like, an argument from random ramen with weird views.

1487
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Oh, yeah, I think, I don't know. You read it yourself, but I thought it's referring to the internal.

1488
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
To the actual, his disciples among himself are not arguing like other sects.

1489
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Because you see that in other suitors when they praise, and I see all these disciples always in Concord always sort of sharing the same views and taking it.

1490
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Unlike when I go there, they're arguing, attacking the teacher, and I say this, you say that.

1491
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You have the book here.

1492
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But you know, I don't know what's the impression I've got.

1493
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But either way, either way. They cannot argue among themselves.

1494
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Right.

1495
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
If they have a right view, nor will they go into an actual dispute with somebody else on account of it, impossible.

1496
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Like, if another person comes, asks, he gives a speech, they disagree.

1497
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Like, it's absolutely not my problem, and certainly not me.

1498
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Or nothing that I need to defend will convince you.

1499
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Like, always, even when the Buddha was teaching something, there's like, no, they would check their head in disapproval and say, well, yes, okay, must go down my go.

1500
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And the Buddha couldn't care less.

1501
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So, while he says, ah, he didn't accept what I said. He didn't believe me.

1502
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And then he would go to another people who can't approve his view.
