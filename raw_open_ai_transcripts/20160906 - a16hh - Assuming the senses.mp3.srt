1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now you have specific questions?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well there's a few things I'm excited about.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There's one about assuming the senses, assuming the senses.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If one assumes the senses then on account of their feelings grow

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and the mind becomes damaged with covetousness and cruelty.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And acts and...

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah this is just a heaping up of suffering.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No one is said to be far from the banner.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So when seeing a sight, mindfulness becomes confused if attention is focused on the pleasant aspect.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Doing this one remains assuming.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well basically mindfulness gets confused if one attends the pleasant aspect

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which is the feelings that have a rose based on the assumed senses.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So through simply attending that pleasure that's the result of that assumption

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you're actually maintaining that assumption through that pleasure.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So yes there is...

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can say the assumption comes first but not temporarily first but structurally first.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So it's simultaneous presence of the assumption and the feelings of the result.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's not an account of that assumption but it's simultaneous.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not like you're assuming without feeling and then the feeling comes.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And because it's simultaneous simply through attending feelings you're maintaining

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
that which sort of determines those feelings which is that assumption.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And at the same time your mind...

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well they suffer.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or the result of that whole picture suffering is present.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Even that is again the same principle of that simultaneous presence.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So then you can say assumption results in feelings or assumption results in suffering

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
or assumption results in craving or craving results.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's just simultaneously presence is just maintaining each other

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
because you're attending a new bit in that sense.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So the principle gets maintained.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah well mind seems being confused equals the whole system.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Within what is assuming the sense it means?

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well assuming the senses means...

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well literally assuming those senses to be yours or to be...

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well assuming a sense to be yours and then assuming that which you gather

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
through those senses to be for you.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So you assume that the sights you see are the sights that your eyes see.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The sights that you look for you they're yours.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Even if you're looking at things that are not necessarily yours,

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the further you're looking with your eyes it's like your sight.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So then sight is for me any sight of anything.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So you have to start seeing the dead phenomenon of senses,

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
of my senses.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's kind of always a negative.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can't actually see your eye with the same eye in the same sense.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So you can... you end up assuming...

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well you end up assuming because the senses are ambiguous.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You don't really know it's like a big kind of dark vague cloud of all senses.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But then all you have is sight sounds, mouth taste,

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I just for you.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So then you just take it for granted.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But if you discern long enough through that repetition that...

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Whatever notion of your senses you might have,

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
that those senses are...

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh I think my senses are visitor.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If you discern that whatever notion you might have,

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
those senses will never ever be anything more

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and certainly will never be anything separable from a

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
flashy organ of eye, skin, tongue.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But literally these organs, random objects in the world,

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that are put together in the unit of this body.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So you don't examine the organ like a doctor would impersonally,

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
because then it doesn't work.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then you don't see that connection.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You don't see that dependence.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So you have to see your own organs.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And the only way you can see it is in that external sense of...

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, a lump of flesh, which is my eye,

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
tongue, ears, ear drums, it's just organs.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Literally just...

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Just as you have this, this bin,

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
broom, stone, tree, eye,

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
liquid, matter, brain,

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
brain, brain, basically four elements.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But these particular material organs are that

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
because of which there are sites that you can discern in the world.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But it's not in you nor is it for you.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Those organs are external, as external,

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
as the external objects are on you.

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You just...

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You don't see the connection.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And that connection literally needs to be fabricated.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Like you will never see the connection naturally.

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a secondary.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Because natural...

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Natural way is the way of ignorance.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Natural way is the way that goes with the grain.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So you have to go against the grain.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And basically,

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
but if you were to dwell on it long enough,

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
like a fabricating contemplation that your senses

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
are inseparable, like when I say my senses,

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
whatever vague thought you might have about it,

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
take it as vague.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You have to define it.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Take it as a whole phenomenon, as an entity,

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
that vague thought of my senses,

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and then see the presence of that

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is directly determined inseparable

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
from the flesh eye, the tongue, the skin,

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the nose, ears, brain, whatever.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You literally, like, no matter what vague thought

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I might have about my senses,

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the fact that I can even think that,

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
ambiguously, absolutely is because

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
this living matter of my body

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
of this sixth sense base is present

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in that material form.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because when again gets destroyed,

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can't be handed.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's inconceivable.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So no matter how much you...

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
your mind, your thoughts,

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
your idea of senses might feel

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
different from the material objects,

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
fundamentally, it can never

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
like escape it.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So destruction of matter will bring an end to this.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So that's why I'm realizing that,

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
no matter how much you

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
volitionally, reflexively developed,

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
you know, your thoughts,

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and your disturbance, and your abstractions,

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and your reflect, whatever, whatever you want,

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it's all there possible

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
because there is a living sixth sense

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
body present in the world,

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
as a matter.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
When that matter gets destroyed,

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and the material is disintegrated,

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you can't be conceiving and abstracting

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
in regard to it.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can't know any mental phenomena.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So no matter what intentionality,

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
you can have with your mind,

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
it's subordinate to the presence of

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that gratuitous matter

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that is living, which is your body,

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
life. When that's taken away,

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
nothing can be left.

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Nothing can remain.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're just inconceivable.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But it's like contemplating,

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
like drilling, literally drilling,

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that connection, because it's not,

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you're not going to, it's not obvious.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It seems fabricated, it seems abstract.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And it is, for Kutuzina,

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
it is completely abstract.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But it's a right abstraction.

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's the abstraction that,

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
if repeated sufficient number of times,

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it will,

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
like take root,

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
it will correspond to how things actually are.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then you can see how things actually are.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Which is that, yes,

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
your senses cannot even be conceived to be yours.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's impossible.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let alone that which you acquire

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:41,000
for your senses to be for you.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Come here.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So you see what I mean?

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Like if you think now,

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
or if it's very good, I think it's like,

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
like my eyes, what is my,

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
my eyes, my senses.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You immediately assume as,

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
inside of you, as in turn,

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
as part of you.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But actually, that's a thought.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And you can have just

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the another thought, which is,

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
well, another way of seeing,

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
which is seen as objects as external,

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
as a thought.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, that's the thing. You're always going to have a thought.

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Not perhaps.

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So when I said, oh, that's a thought.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It doesn't mean that I'm dismissing it.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I just meant that that big is.

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That you think is the senses.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You have to see, no, that's a thought.

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That obviously for me stands for that which I think senses are.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So when you start recognizing that all you're going to have is a phenomenon of thought

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
in regard to your senses,

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
then you realize, well,

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
then thinking these external organs,

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
it's nothing less real than this thought.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Because that's also a thought.

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But it's the right thought.

192
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, exactly.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And then somebody tells you, somebody else,

194
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
like the Buddha and the Sutras,

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
tells you that that's the right thought.

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And if you keep repeating it,

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
it will correspond to how things are,

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
because it's right.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And then you can see how things are.

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But not without the sufficient amount of repetition.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because that's what I think we spoke about it before.

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, that's why you can't stumble upon

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
RNA chip or any other sort of,

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
but sort of by accident.

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And oh, yeah, I got it.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Just testing, you know, wow.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Instant training is like doing this,

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and then this happened.

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It doesn't happen.

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You develop it.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Literally through training and drilling.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So like in this instance,

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the Buddha tells you, this is the right thought.

214
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Obviously, experience of protrusion is top to bottom, is completely rock.

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Effective ignorance.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So you don't have a criteria of what is right thought,

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
what it isn't.

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So then you have the faith in the Buddha,

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and the Buddha tells this is the right thought.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And you can think that by thought.

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But thinking it once,

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
won't make a difference,

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
because you have this whole ocean of ignorance

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that needs to be drained away.

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But then thinking it twice won't make a difference.

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thinking it three times won't make a difference.

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A thousand times,

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
then it will be draining away.

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And eventually, when it's officially drained,

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
you will recognize all ignorance is drained.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So the point is,

232
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that drilling,

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
that in the beginning, yeah, you have to do an account of faith,

234
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
in a sense that, okay,

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you believe the Buddha knew what he was talking about,

236
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you have faith, so that's why you're applying that.

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But that's why you can't do that.

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can sometimes accidentally

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
stumble, like,

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
do the right thing, engage in the right thought.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But if you don't know,

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
that that is the right thought,

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
if nobody told you, you will not know,

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
that that was the right thought,

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and you will certainly not repeat it,

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
a thousand times,

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
without any apparent result.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So that's why it's impossible,

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
like by chance, you know, you can roll a dice

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and you can get it once and twice and five times.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But you can't get it, it's just impossible,

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
inconceivable to, like, always get the right result.

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Unless you know that that is the right result,

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and you always go for that.

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So that's why that utterance of another

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
is one of the, like,

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
fundamental factors for the right view.

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So you cannot possibly, as I said,

259
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you might have been doing things rightly,

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
attending things rightly,

261
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
but if nobody externally told you

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that that is the right thing,

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
it's simply inconceivable

264
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that you would have stuck

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
to repeating those things rightly,

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
thousands of times for years,

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
because there is no apparent result,

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
right away.

269
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's not like you do it,

270
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and you immediately see it.

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You just have to keep doing it,

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and doing it, and doing it,

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and doing it,

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and you accept it intellectually

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
as the right thing,

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
like reason, as the Buddha said,

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
oh, the man who wants to be free from suffering

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
goes and, like,

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
frequents the wise man, he listens to what they say.

280
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He ponders, makes sense,

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
measures the task,

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and he does it.

283
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So you accept it through reasoning,

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
through discernment,

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
on that level,

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
but then you keep repeating it,

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and repeating,

288
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and repeating,

289
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and because you had faith,

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
in what the Buddha said,

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
to be right,

292
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
you stick to it,

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and you repeat it,

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
ten thousands of times,

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and because it was right,

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you become an out of hand.

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But if you didn't know,

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
if you didn't have faith,

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
then it was right.

300
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You wouldn't have possibly stuck to it.

301
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
For that long,

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
because there is no,

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
there is no confirmation of it.

304
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But always,

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
until much, much later.

306
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes, no confirmation.

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You might have different results.

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yes.

309
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You might have pleasant results.

310
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You might have a lessening of suffering,

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
or more of an understanding.

312
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What, what, what,

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
what gives you,

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
the motivation to continue,

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
if you haven't had the end,

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you don't have the end result,

317
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but you,

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
it makes sense,

319
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
what the Buddha says,

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
it makes sense,

321
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
so you follow the teaching.

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Then,

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
but you're not getting great results.

324
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, that's,

325
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
that's for somebody who has heard the teaching.

326
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes.

327
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I mean, that can be an inspiration for them to continue,

328
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
even without the apparent results.

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes.

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Because it makes sense.

331
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But imagine how impossible

332
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
is for somebody to continue,

333
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
who hasn't even heard,

334
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
or accepted,

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
through reasoning,

336
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and develop faith,

337
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
that what the Buddha said was right.

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's impossible for them to continue,

339
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
because there is no,

340
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
there is absolutely nothing changes,

341
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
through these drillings,

342
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
through you don't see nothing,

343
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
nothing better,

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
no worse,

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you just,

346
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
you won't even notice it.

347
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And let alone stick to it,

348
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and repeat it thousands of times,

349
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
the right intention,

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
the avoidant,

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the wrong intention,

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and so on and so forth,

353
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
then need to things rightly.

354
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Now, you need to be told,

355
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
when you're told,

356
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
you can discern it,

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
when you discern it,

358
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
then you can do it.

359
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Because as you,

360
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
as it's,

361
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
something makes sense to you,

362
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
so you do it.

363
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And then, say, for example,

364
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
with strength,

365
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
just, you know,

366
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and keep a strength,

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and then,

368
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
you reflex,

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
as you,

370
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
as you do,

371
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and he looks,

372
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and you see that,

373
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
there is,

374
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
so,

375
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
the pleasure of being blindness.

376
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So,

377
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
there's much,

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
he's an arahant,

379
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
he's not a so-to-funner.

380
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But,

381
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
then,

382
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
there are ways of developing wisdom,

383
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
without Buddha's aid,

384
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
but obviously,

385
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
it will never lead to the,

386
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
the final abandoning

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
of the assumption of self,

388
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and self-view,

389
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and arahant.

390
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah.

391
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But I mean that,

392
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
once you've actually heard,

393
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the Buddha's teaching.

394
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, yeah.

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And you do follow,

396
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you do the strain yourself,

397
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but,

398
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
you don't,

399
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
you don't go that far,

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
you don't know if you understand it,

401
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
but you keep the precepts,

402
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you get the joy,

403
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
they come from that,

404
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
then you can,

405
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
maybe be a little bit more confident,

406
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
you think,

407
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
oh, yeah.

408
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There might be something more to this,

409
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
what he says,

410
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
after being restrained,

411
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and the rest of it,

412
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
might also be true,

413
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
so I'll continue on.

414
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, there's,

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
on top of that,

416
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
also,

417
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
as I said,

418
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
like,

419
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you might be doing things rightly,

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
or not,

421
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you don't know,

422
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and because,

423
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you haven't been told externally,

424
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
through, like,

425
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
through the sutras,

426
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and through the Buddha's instruction,

427
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
why you should be doing,

428
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you don't really have,

429
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
even the external criteria

430
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
of what kind of corresponds

431
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to what,

432
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
what might be right.

433
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So,

434
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
but then,

435
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
if you were to develop that criteria,

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
then you can look back

437
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
at the stuff

438
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
you used to do,

439
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and you can,

440
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
actually,

441
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
yeah, back then,

442
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
this,

443
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
such and such things,

444
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
such and such way of attending,

445
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that I was doing,

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that was actually right,

447
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it corresponds

448
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to the print number principle,

449
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
so to speak,

450
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
it corresponds to how things,

451
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
obviously,

452
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
back then,

453
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you didn't know,

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
what those principles were,

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
so you couldn't have stuck to it,

456
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and repeated it long enough,

457
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
you can't,

458
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
you can do it by chance,

459
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
once, twice,

460
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
ten times,

461
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but not ten thousands of times,

462
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
by chance,

463
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
impossible.

464
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You need to have an anchor,

465
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
to bring you back,

466
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
which would be the discernment.

467
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And then,

468
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you can also look back and see,

469
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
oh,

470
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
when I thought I was right,

471
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and practicing,

472
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
it was completely wrong.

473
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Because now,

474
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
you've got the criteria

475
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
that you can also see,

476
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
things in the past,

477
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
you used to do,

478
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
your attempts at practice,

479
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and so on,

480
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and you can see,

481
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
oh, actually, no,

482
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
that was not that wrong.

483
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But obviously, back then,

484
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
you didn't know,

485
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
if somebody told you back then,

486
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you would have stuck to it,

487
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
but nobody told you,

488
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
so it took you longer,

489
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
or not,

490
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
it depends.

491
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But that's why it's,

492
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
it's not optional,

493
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
after and after another.

494
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But then, obviously,

495
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that's why it also,

496
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it needs,

497
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
needs to have that initial step,

498
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
first step of faith,

499
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
that you have faith,

500
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
there is other,

501
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the Buddha,

502
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the Sutras,

503
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the Arun,

504
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
the Sothmana,

505
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
might be,

506
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
the Buddha,

507
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the Sutra,

508
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
the Arun,

509
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
the Sothmana,

510
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
might know what they're talking about,

511
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but again,

512
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
it's not that that faith needs to stay,

513
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
till the end,

514
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
that faith is the initial push,

515
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and then, you know,

516
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
if you do it rightly,

517
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
you'll come to recognize,

518
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and then you won't need faith,

519
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
or rather,

520
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
you'll replace the faith

521
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
with confidence,

522
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
because now you know,

523
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and that's the surface.

524
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Confirm confidence,

525
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
in the Buddha,

526
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
the Dhamma,

527
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
the Sangha,

528
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
it replaces that faith

529
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
in the Buddha,

530
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
now you know,

531
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't need to believe in it,

532
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
because I know it.

533
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's like,

534
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
it's similar to,

535
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
something makes sense.

536
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You don't know,

537
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
it makes the most sense,

538
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and then,

539
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
you understand.

540
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But always,

541
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
always in the back of your mind,

542
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
have a little bit of reserve,

543
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
because,

544
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
as a Patugina,

545
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
you don't have a criteria

546
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
of what really makes,

547
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
or rather,

548
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
what makes sense

549
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to you as a Patugina,

550
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
does not necessarily mean

551
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
is the right thing.

552
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So,

553
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because often,

554
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,000
yeah,

555
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it feels right,

556
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
when people are like,

557
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
oh, I know,

558
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm not a certain one,

559
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
but it feels right,

560
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
it's like, well,

561
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
that's a big mistake,

562
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
right there.

563
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You know,

564
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
you don't know,

565
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
yet,

566
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you're happy to follow

567
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
what you think you know,

568
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
while you,

569
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
at the same time say,

570
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't know.

571
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So, you're just like,

572
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
undermining yourself

573
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
within the same sentence.

574
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, it's okay.

575
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
There's somebody there

576
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
that is,

577
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
there's a connection

578
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
with the,

579
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and the Buddha says,

580
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the Dhamma

581
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
is leading onwards.

582
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Mm-hmm.

583
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Obviously,

584
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
anyone can read that,

585
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and is that,

586
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
maybe not a,

587
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
something that you,

588
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
like a criteria,

589
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
is what they look for, isn't it?

590
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But then, again,

591
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
you need to discern,

592
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
because, like,

593
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm sure that people who think,

594
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
uh, Dhamma leading,

595
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
like,

596
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
open eye,

597
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
means leading onwards,

598
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
or leading onwards,

599
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
or, uh,

600
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sure that they're,

601
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
they're convinced

602
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
that that is what it means.

603
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So, you need to be

604
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
completely self-transparent

605
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and see.

606
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Okay.

607
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So, do I really hold on to

608
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
this belief,

609
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
just because it's pleasing to me?

610
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Mm-hmm.

611
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Just because it suits my other beliefs?

612
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Or it's because you really,

613
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
really make sense after,

614
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
like, deep,

615
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
profound, repetitive,

616
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
tedious,

617
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
drilling,

618
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
investigation,

619
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and contemplation?

620
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
When you know,

621
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
that you have not,

622
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
kind of,

623
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
just covered it up,

624
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
oh, no, no,

625
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I believe in this,

626
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
it's fine,

627
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
but you really drilled into it,

628
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and there was nothing left unturned,

629
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
then, okay,

630
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
it's least likely

631
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
to be wrong,

632
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
because you really drilled through it,

633
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
through the whole thing.

634
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And then,

635
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the answer should

636
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
you always have to have.

637
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But most often,

638
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
people just maintain beliefs,

639
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
because,

640
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
it helps them maintain their

641
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
previous beliefs,

642
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
helps them maintain their previous beliefs,

643
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and then,

644
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
so it's just, like,

645
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
maintenance of their beliefs.

646
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And,

647
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
they all do that,

648
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
for one reason,

649
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
it's pleasing to me.

650
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Has this said the same?

651
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Well,

652
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
what is leading on this?

653
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Well,

654
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
leading onwards is exactly that.

655
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Like,

656
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
if you were to understand,

657
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
for example,

658
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
what down there is,

659
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
that understanding

660
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
will be taking you further,

661
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and further,

662
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and further till the orange,

663
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
so it's leading you onwards

664
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
through that understanding.

665
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So it's not a theory,

666
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
it's not as

667
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
abstraction,

668
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
it's not something you can accept

669
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
or reject.

670
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's something whereby,

671
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
through understanding,

672
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
you are going further.

673
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So then,

674
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you realize there is more.

675
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There is more.

676
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Through that understanding,

677
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
through that criteria,

678
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
there is more,

679
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
there is more.

680
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Until,

681
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
as I answer,

682
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
or,

683
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,000
or,

684
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
or,

685
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,000
or,

686
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
or,

687
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,000
or,

688
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
or,

689
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
or,

690
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,000
or,

691
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
or,

692
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,000
or,

693
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
or,

694
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,000
or,

695
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
or,

696
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,000
or,

697
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
or,

698
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
or,

699
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,000
or,

700
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
or,

701
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
or,

702
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
or,

703
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
or,

704
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
or,

705
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,000
or,

706
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
or,

707
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:44,000
or,

708
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
or,

709
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,000
or,

710
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
or,

711
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
or,

712
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
or,

713
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,500
or,

714
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,000
or,

715
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,000
or,

716
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
or,

717
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,000
or,

718
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
or,

719
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,000
or,

720
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
or,

721
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,000

or,

725
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,000
or,

726
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:52,000
or,

727
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
or

728
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
or,

729
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and,

730
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:54,000
or,

731
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
or,

732
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
or,

733
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,000
or,

734
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,000
or,

735
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
or,

736
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,000
or,

737
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
or,

738
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,000
or.

739
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Or,

740
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
or,

741
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
or,

742
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,000
or,

743
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
or,

744
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,000
or,

745
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,000
or,

746
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
or,

747
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,000
or...

748
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
or,

749
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:04,000
or,

750
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,000
or,

751
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
or,

752
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
or,

753
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,000
or,

754
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
or,

755
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,400
And I think I told you that the other day,

756
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,160
he never, like, no matter what approach he would take on

757
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,200
in expanding the amount to a person or to a group of people,

758
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,520
he would follow that approach through

759
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,120
to define a point of orange, if you're from suffering,

760
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,760
whatever, even if those people don't necessarily achieve it,

761
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,640
his instruction would go all the way.

762
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,360
He wouldn't stop halfway through his approach

763
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,240
that through understanding of number up by and the all,

764
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,080
you can become an arrogant and so on.

765
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
He wouldn't stop halfway through and then say,

766
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,280
well, as a matter of fact, number up,

767
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
also corresponds to the five aggregates,

768
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
and then start comparing it linearly,

769
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
always right, you can, it does correspond.

770
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,400
This is experienced as a whole,

771
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,960
whether you take it as five aggregates,

772
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,680
or number up,

773
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,960
vinyana, vinyana,

774
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,360
number up,

775
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,960
but this and that, literally,

776
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
but if you start comparing it,

777
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,280
it thesis to be that open icon, like leading on,

778
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,000
which means it thesis to be dama,

779
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,200
because dama is dama only when it leads you out of suffering,

780
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,000
when it leads you towards enlightenment.

781
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,840
So we can be talking the dama,

782
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,720
like dama terms and stuff,

783
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,040
the fact that it's not leading on,

784
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
it's not the dama.

785
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,520
And that's why,

786
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,520
like, you can't even by accident teach dama

787
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,600
to somebody else,

788
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
without you yourself understanding it,

789
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,560
because that open icon element,

790
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,040
it's something you can't,

791
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,800
it's something you can understand and know,

792
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,320
and then convey to another person in the writer,

793
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,680
knowing what, like,

794
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,720
basically knowing what to say for them to understand,

795
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,560
not sort of comparing dama and comparing the principles

796
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,120
and the terminology for the sake,

797
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,040
like for the scholarly sake by itself, in itself,

798
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,920
and then presented as a kind of, okay,

799
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,640
here is a theory, here is my explanation,

800
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,600
and it's like, okay, sure, I accept that,

801
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,680
and that's it, you leave it at that.

802
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,920
So a person who understood,

803
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,200
I can run into the Buddha,

804
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
would know that,

805
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,720
because that's what understanding is.

806
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,560
So then they wouldn't be teaching as a form of explanation,

807
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,400
and that's the difference,

808
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,200
when you're explaining something,

809
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,520
ah, okay, it makes sense, that's it,

810
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,560
or when you're leading somebody onwards

811
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,760
in their understanding.

812
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,720
So sure, I could compare,

813
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
like if Nama Rupa, Vinyalna, with Foward,

814
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,920
it's if, as a whole,

815
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,080
that approach is leading you onwards.

816
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,480
But if we're just doing it for the sake of debate,

817
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,160
like abstractively reasoning,

818
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,200
or whatever, just theory,

819
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,000
or just because it's pleasing to me,

820
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,880
there's just pointless.

821
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,160
Even if we actually talk about them all the time,

822
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,000
we're not, because there is no leading onwards element.

823
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,640
But again, you can see leading onwards,

824
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,520
like when I said about the assumption of the senses,

825
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,160
I could have said,

826
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,800
well, see, that's because you think your senses are yours,

827
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,400
and that's it.

828
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,840
Okay, so I should think my senses are not mine,

829
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,080
and that's it.

830
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,760
But it, that's just linear,

831
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,960
and there is absolutely no lead,

832
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,120
but if I tell you, well actually you have to stop.

833
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,440
You have to see that your senses,

834
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,080
the thought of what you think your senses are,

835
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,080
is inseparable from that material thought, again,

836
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,080
of the flesh, eye, and all of the other other sense bases.

837
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,600
So you have to keep drilling that connection on and on and on.

838
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,720
Not just once, okay, that this is not mine,

839
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,800
but you have to discern it and see dependent upon that.

840
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,720
And then you will have, like if you abandon your senses,

841
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,920
means that the feelings won't be generated,

842
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,680
which means that the mindfulness will not be clouded,

843
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,160
which means the suffering won't arise, and you will feel that,

844
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,840
you will feel the absence of suffering.

845
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,720
So you know, like sure, I could say to myself,

846
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,200
senses are not mine,

847
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
but it doesn't make sense,

848
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,160
it makes any no difference to the suffering

849
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,800
that you experience, or that you might experience.

850
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,280
Suffering that you might be liable to, makes no difference.

851
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,320
And if it makes no difference, it means it's not a dharma.

852
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,160
Even if you're actually reading the sutra,

853
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,120
but it's not a dharma.

854
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,440
But if you attempt to things rightly,

855
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,520
and you undo the assumption of your senses,

856
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,560
so through that undoing, you are actually not liable

857
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,560
to that suffering anymore, and you can know that, you know.

858
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,600
This is dharma, because it's directly freeing it from suffering.

859
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,960
But in order to be able to see that, to discern that,

860
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,080
you need to be completely self-transparent

861
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,680
and not act out of this use, simply pleasing to me,

862
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,440
that's why I'm holding it.

863
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,520
So you have to be ready to have some very displeased new views,

864
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,240
some views that will fill you with anxiety

865
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,120
and everything else that follows,

866
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,960
because you're undoing, like your own assumption

867
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,000
of your own very existence, of your own sense of self,

868
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,240
of your own confidence as a person, as a whatever else,

869
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,840
you're undoing all of that,

870
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,960
and using only criteria of absence of suffering.

871
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,360
And you can see like, oh well, this actually,

872
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,880
I'm not just acting because it's pleasing,

873
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,120
this is really the real thing.

874
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,800
And then look at that.

875
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,760
If you were to find out the next moment,

876
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
that that is not a real thing,

877
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,360
would you be filled with terror and anxiety?

878
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,200
You would, means it's not a real thing.

879
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,040
No, you'll think.

880
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,520
No, the real thing.

881
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,240
Like, as I said, the approach that you took,

882
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,000
like, oh, I'm gonna hold this view,

883
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
because it's pleasing to me.

884
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,120
That's like, okay, that's not good, that's not awesome.

885
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,800
So I'm gonna hold this view,

886
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,280
but I'm not doing it because it's pleasing to me.

887
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,120
Fine?

888
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
I might be true, but then look at that.

889
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,160
Look whereby, if that view is taken away from you,

890
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,760
or if you find out that it's wrong,

891
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,360
would you be affected personally?

892
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,400
Like thoroughly, and you realize, yes, I would.

893
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,280
Okay, so that view might not be wrong,

894
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,760
but I'm certainly holding on to it,

895
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,600
because if that view is gone,

896
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,440
I'll experience this anxiety and terror,

897
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,040
which means I need to take it further.

898
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,080
So, in a way, you are still holding

899
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,480
because it's pleasing to you,

900
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,360
even if it's the right view.

901
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,200
But if you're holding a view,

902
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,200
regardless of it giving you pleasure,

903
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,920
or giving you pain.

904
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,200
But yet, it just, you can't see it in the other way,

905
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
it just, you know, it's...

906
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,840
Well, first of all, you can, but not hold on, you've used,

907
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,280
because it's not, you can only go beyond it

908
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,080
as an arahant.

909
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,520
But before that, you can only hold the right views

910
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,120
on a kind of wrong views.

911
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,320
Or you can hold the wrong views

912
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,000
and not have any right views.

913
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,480
But, you know, the whole notion of,

914
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,880
oh, I don't hold any views, that's a view.

915
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,440
And that there was that sort of,

916
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,200
that I'm actually referring to, when you said,

917
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,000
oh, he said, you could ask him,

918
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,320
like, so what views do you have?

919
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,480
He said, ah, Master Gautama, I have, what is he saying?

920
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,040
Oh, yeah, I have no, I have no,

921
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,720
he said, he asked me, well, views are pleasing to you,

922
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,520
like, no, Master Gautama, I don't accept any views,

923
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,640
I have no views, no views are pleasing to me.

924
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,040
And he said, well, surely, that view is pleasing to you,

925
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,240
you know, not holding ten of views, it's also a view.

926
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,520
So you had to discern that, in the same sense of,

927
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,960
just stop thinking, I'm not thinking,

928
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,240
well, that's a thought, you're just contradicting yourself

929
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,720
right there and then.

930
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,040
So in the same sense, if you're believing

931
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
you're not holding ten of views,

932
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,560
you're kind of in limbo hovering over,

933
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,280
that's a view that you have clearly not aware of.

934
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,920
And for as long as you don't become aware of,

935
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,320
you can't abandon it.

936
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,880
So you have to recognize, you have no choice

937
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,680
but to hold the views.

938
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,000
What you can't use is develop the right views

939
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,600
at the expense of wrong views.

940
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,560
And then hold the right views, then because they're right,

941
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,680
they will take you eventually beyond the views.

942
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,080
And then you become an Arahant,

943
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,440
but even then, I'm not holding any views, no,

944
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,720
I won't be on the views.

945
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,360
So holding, we're not holding, we're both holding,

946
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,080
and now they're holding, they're not holding,

947
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,840
simply doesn't apply anymore, you've dropped it all.

948
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,200
You know, that's another suit, a 38.

949
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,320
Not humanly kind, you know.

950
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,560
Which is, this right view,

951
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,280
as pleasing as it is, as pure as bright.

952
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,720
If you were holding, yeah.

953
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,000
If you were to hold onto this view,

954
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
you would not be...

955
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,800
Practicing, placing it, yeah.

956
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,720
You would not understand the damage to be a wrath,

957
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,440
yeah, yeah, it's a wrath, yeah.

958
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,080
See, yes.

959
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:47,560
And that's what would happen to Aryasavakas

960
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,600
who were not, who didn't reach Arahant,

961
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,320
who kind of got complacent,

962
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,040
like so to say, in the suit,

963
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,240
because basically, they got, you know,

964
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,200
and yeah, the great master's sovereignty

965
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,800
has been destroyed, and so on.

966
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,280
And then please do that, which means they won't be pushing

967
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,360
that view further, they'll just hold onto it,

968
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
because they're satisfied with what they got,

969
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,360
basically, they got complacent.

970
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,480
So that's what will happen.

971
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,880
So yes, even the right view.

972
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,960
But yeah, oh, so that's not a bad thing.

973
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,320
I mean, it's a bad thing,

974
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,080
from a rather, it's not fully adequate thing

975
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,160
from the point of view of an Arahant,

976
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,240
but from Pratujana.

977
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,080
Yes, please, by all means,

978
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,920
everybody should try and get the right view

979
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,840
and hold onto it daily, rather than the wrong view.

980
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,560
Because actually, holding onto the right view,

981
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,800
it's, well, you can, because it's a right view,

982
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,720
because you have the right view,

983
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,520
you have the right criteria,

984
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,680
you can see that you're holding onto it.

985
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,880
So you can, like not exert yourself in practice further,

986
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,360
but you know, as Pratujana, the danger is,

987
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,480
you don't know that.

988
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,120
You don't know that you're holding onto those views.

989
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,320
And for as long as you don't know,

990
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,120
there's absolutely no way you can abandon them.

991
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:05,120
So it's much more dangerous.

992
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,480
It's absolutely, you know,

993
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,720
you're going back to something making sense.

994
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,240
I would have, you know, you have faith, I'd get that makes sense.

995
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,200
But there's always your own effort, you have to,

996
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,120
there's always this, your own effort.

997
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,440
So even though it makes sense,

998
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,960
you're also going to be authentic enough to see it.

999
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,840
I'm, there is no, even though it's pleasant,

1000
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,440
this idea, this view, this monk says,

1001
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,280
and I really believe what he says.

1002
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,560
But you know, I don't really experience what he says,

1003
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,560
because I would, I would make that effort.

1004
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,760
I would make that effort, so how can I really know?

1005
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,200
Making that effort is when I say,

1006
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,920
ah, you need, you need to do the drilling on and on and on.

1007
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,680
Drilling of the right contemplation, right attending,

1008
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,640
drilling of not tolerating unwholesome states,

1009
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,640
not tolerating essential flows, not all of those are drilling,

1010
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,600
all of these hard work, internal work.

1011
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,680
And yeah, that's basically 99%.

1012
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,080
You need to do that.

1013
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,040
And in the same sense, well,

1014
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,840
what this, such and such monk said, it makes sense.

1015
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,720
Then you start drilling it, you start applying it,

1016
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,600
and then you actually know it's wrong,

1017
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,280
and then you will know why it's wrong,

1018
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,520
and where it's wrong, and how it's wrong.

1019
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,560
This is also this kind of, you can actually see what to do.

1020
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,360
So this not only makes sense,

1021
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,280
but you, you're able to see what you have to do,

1022
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,560
but I guess, like, you're leading on with this.

1023
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,080
Oh, yeah, that's the other bit in the suit,

1024
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,520
it says he measures the task.

1025
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,880
You know exactly how much what needs to be done,

1026
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,320
what needs the task that he's mentioned,

1027
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,360
it makes sense.

1028
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Yeah, you know.

1029
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,200
That's it.

1030
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,520
Oh, he listen, he hears this, okay.

1031
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,480
This, this sounds promising.

1032
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,720
Then he ponders on it, he gets some understanding

1033
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,920
through reasoning and acceptance.

1034
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,080
Okay, and by having the understanding,

1035
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,600
that's already like almost like a beginning of wisdom.

1036
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,120
By having that discernment, then he can, okay,

1037
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,680
so this is what needs to be done.

1038
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,840
Because most of the people today, like monks or laypeople,

1039
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,960
when he comes to practice,

1040
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,400
it's just this vast and biggest blur of everything

1041
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,400
and nothing, what needs to be done well,

1042
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,400
you just, you know, be here, now, yesterday, tomorrow.

1043
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,840
Like, as if you have a choice, but to be here now,

1044
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,720
where else can you be?

1045
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,560
You make marriage.

1046
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
So it's just this is a big,

1047
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,440
it's weird, mystical, why?

1048
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,360
Because they haven't measured the task,

1049
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,520
but you did as soon as the Buddha would clearly say,

1050
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,000
and people would clearly say,

1051
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,640
this needs to be done, so you,

1052
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,840
and so knowing what needs to be done,

1053
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,440
even as protrusion requires some development of wisdom.

1054
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,440
So measuring the task is actually quite a significant stage,

1055
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,560
so to speak, no, okay, if I do this,

1056
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,120
like I could expect that.

1057
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,000
So you know, if I were to apply myself in such a manner,

1058
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,840
for certain period of time, I don't know exactly for how long,

1059
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,880
but if I keep applying myself in this manner to that extent,

1060
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,040
I might be on the way to be free from suffering,

1061
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,120
and then you do it.

1062
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,280
And having it like that, measure the task,

1063
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,360
you won't need any external inspiration,

1064
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,000
you won't need, like, download talks and poetry

1065
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,280
to kind of make you feel energised to practice, no.

1066
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,280
You measure the task, you see the end goal, you do it,

1067
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,920
and that's why you do it.

1068
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,360
And then you can't blame it, you can't actually,

1069
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,120
if you aren't blaming your circumstances or...

1070
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,400
Oh yeah, no, it becomes personal.

1071
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,520
It becomes, like the said, to be known

1072
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,280
in the personal individually by the wise,

1073
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,920
by those who are developing wisdom,

1074
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,600
to measure the task, to apply themselves,

1075
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,160
and then to reach the goal.

1076
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,400
It's like seeing, you see what's going on.

1077
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,880
Oh, there's nothing to be attained,

1078
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,600
there is nothing to be done, there is nothing that,

1079
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,720
find me the suited, it says that.

1080
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,560
You want?

1081
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,400
Cause I don't know.

1082
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,880
I mean, you find it in other schools of Buddhism and stuff,

1083
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,720
and why?

1084
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,920
Because they themselves haven't measured the task,

1085
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,160
haven't developed discernment to be able

1086
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,240
to have the tools to measure the task.

1087
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,000
And all that's because they haven't been transparent

1088
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,080
from the beginning, self-transparent.

1089
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,000
If you were transparent, you would always be coming

1090
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,320
from the place of I want to be free from suffering,

1091
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,120
which means you'll never cover it up,

1092
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,960
so no matter how pleasing the view is,

1093
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,360
how pleasing the teacher is,

1094
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,880
how is this freeing you from suffering?

1095
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,080
I don't know, I'll give it a bit more, more time, more time.

1096
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,040
So you're applying yourself,

1097
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,240
and if it's still not making any difference to suffering,

1098
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,080
you will drop it, you will move on.

1099
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,320
Because that criteria is the fundamental,

1100
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,880
and that is the criteria that, yes,

1101
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,360
the pathogen I can trust,

1102
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,480
like full transparent freedom from suffering.

1103
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,200
So you're not, okay, this might be freeing you from suffering,

1104
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,400
then you stop and think.

1105
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,320
If somebody's to take away this particular practice

1106
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,560
that I started engaging in, that I think is freeing

1107
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,080
from suffering, would I suffer on a kind of that?

1108
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,760
And then I would.

1109
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,160
So then you practice on that level even further,

1110
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,440
and then you'll see what you were doing was actually freeing

1111
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,440
from suffering, all you were just holding onto it,

1112
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,800
because it was pleasing to you.

1113
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,800
But what if you, what if you, you,

1114
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,520
do you want to check on that?

1115
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,200
Are these going to, I have to bring.

1116
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,200
What if you have a view that if you have no one can take away,

1117
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,120
that's the right view, that no matter what way you think of it?

1118
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,160
Well, you can't actually reverse it,

1119
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,080
you can't see things in a different way.

1120
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,920
If you, you could try, you would have to come back.

1121
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,200
Come, the axis by doubt.

1122
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,520
Yeah.

1123
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,040
And that is the right view,

1124
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
when the feather of doubt disappears.

1125
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,800
So you can reach the right view

1126
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,400
by fully, transparently, doubting any views that you hold.

1127
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,840
Like, don't hold back, don't leave anything unturned.

1128
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,160
And then that, which is left, cannot be accessed

1129
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,240
by that full-on, cultivated doubt.

1130
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah.

1131
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,480
And you can see, like, you know, you can doubt this,

1132
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,000
you can doubt that, but you can doubt the presence of doubt,

1133
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,200
which means there is a, there is a thing present,

1134
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,800
which means there is a nature of that thing.

1135
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,040
And be doubt or something else,

1136
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,280
you can doubt the presence of the thing.

1137
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,280
And that's what now it pertains to, that's the beginning.

1138
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,720
If you think that calls,

1139
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,720
and then you'll be just kind of going further or further away

1140
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,680
from any doubt, in that sense.

1141
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,600
Yes, sir.

1142
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,240
Because, well, there is happiness present.

1143
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,120
Oh, there is resistance present.

1144
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,840
Oh, there is sensuality present.

1145
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,080
Oh, there is doubt present.

1146
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,120
Well, all those things have become a thing present.

1147
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Yeah.

1148
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,640
And there's no doubt about that.

1149
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,240
And there is no doubt that can even access that.

1150
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,120
Like, you can doubt particular aspects,

1151
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,440
often a reason thing, but you can doubt the arising of the thing,

1152
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,040
which is why the inside of Sotapana comes from the very bottom.

1153
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,280
Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of seeing.

1154
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,920
Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of seeing.

1155
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,920
Doesn't say this, which has the, no, whatever,

1156
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,280
be doubt, be sensuality, be happiness, being sent,

1157
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,640
whatever has the nature of arising for that reason has the nature of seeing.

1158
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,520
Or, rather, for that reason, it's impermanent.

1159
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,760
And that's another topic I'm about.

1160
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,680
It's spoken about it in different talks as well,

1161
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,360
but things are not impermanent because you watch their destruction,

1162
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
watch their disappearance.

1163
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,640
They're impermanent because they are rose.

1164
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,080
They came to be.

1165
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,000
That's why they're impermanent.

1166
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,360
One could have that view, or not doubt that view.

1167
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:40,480
One could see it, but it is impossible to not have...

1168
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,320
You don't necessarily release it from Tukka.

1169
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,680
Oh, yes.

1170
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
You won't be.

1171
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,520
He takes now repetition of that right view on and on and on,

1172
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,120
until it kind of saturates your experience as a whole

1173
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,840
and flushes out all the ignorance and origin.

1174
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,000
But you can still have no doubt, in a way.

1175
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,040
You think that, like, no, you can have?

1176
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,000
Well, you can have no doubt, but, like, that's just the first step.

1177
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,600
Now, you have to keep applying that view, which is inaccessible to doubt.

1178
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,840
But if you're not applying it, you're just holding that view

1179
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,880
and you're not doing anything else.

1180
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,480
Yeah, sure.

1181
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,800
You go to the great view of that beyond the doubt.

1182
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,520
But I'm not saying it's a good one.

1183
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,680
Well, it's not a sin. And that's why you have even those, like,

1184
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,000
Dhamma Nusari and Sadhana Nusari, this kind of contusion is,

1185
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,600
they will attain to the path, but they will not sub one as yet.

1186
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,960
Is this...

1187
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,760
Dhamma Nusari and Sadhana Nusari, whether they came through faith,

1188
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,200
or they came through the Dhamma investigation and reasoning.

1189
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,600
They will arrive at the path, eventually.

1190
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,840
So, yeah, you can get the view, but again, as I said,

1191
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,880
it's a gradual drilling repetition that it's sort of, like,

1192
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,960
bit by bit, by bit, by bit, undoing your ignorance.

1193
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,400
And as the Buddha said, you can't say,

1194
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,560
oh, today, my ignorance has been undone this much.

1195
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,200
Yesterday, that much, tomorrow, it will be this much.

1196
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,720
No, it's like the carpenter using the axe every day for years.

1197
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,520
Every day, he grabs that axe, that the handle is wearing thin.

1198
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,160
But he can't say, yes, they're different today.

1199
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,720
Oh, this is how much it wore off.

1200
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,880
But after a year of using it, he can come and wonder, he can look.

1201
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,160
Oh, my goodness.

1202
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,800
My axe handle is very thin.

1203
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,240
Look, completely worn out.

1204
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:51,160
Because, as I said, a person who is, who is gone beyond doubt,

1205
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:59,000
but that person would see, then, that it's, you can't doubt his view,

1206
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,160
but he's not getting any further on account of his own effort

1207
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,280
that he's making or not making.

1208
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,360
That might have strengthened his putting into the practice

1209
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,800
or furthering that view, or developing that view.

1210
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,280
You know what I mean?

1211
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,000
So, not only is you, beyond doubt, but you're also

1212
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,360
beyond doubt that any further development is due to my own effort.

1213
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,880
Yeah, yeah.

1214
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,280
That's why, like, whatever it was to be obtained

1215
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,040
by the male and the half of the man in Australia, I've obtained,

1216
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,960
basically, it's completely on you.

1217
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,160
You know, you can't, you know, it's just others,

1218
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,160
like people, and even Alacada's circles,

1219
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,200
and anything, it's irrelevant.

1220
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,840
For as long as you have the living functioning mind,

1221
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,400
as you say, once you get the right view,

1222
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,200
there is nothing standing in between you and other handship

1223
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,440
except your lack of effort.

1224
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,480
Nothing else.

1225
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,720
There is nothing else that can come in the way,

1226
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,960
which is why it can't be taken away

1227
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,320
because it wasn't given to you externally either.

1228
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,760
It's something you develop fully, and it's like a one-way,

1229
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,040
one-way development.

1230
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,360
You can't undo it.

1231
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:19,360
But nothing except yourself stands in the way you get to know this.

1232
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,880
I don't know if you remember this quote.

1233
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:39,880
The story says a guard is made free from all troubles

1234
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,880
on account of nature.

1235
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,880
So we, but the sage is free from all troubles.

1236
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,880
On account of his own effort.

1237
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,880
So he's better.

1238
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,880
He's even stronger than a guard.

1239
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,880
Because he's not, well, exactly, he's stronger than a guard

1240
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,880
because gold was not strong because they were given.

1241
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,880
Yeah, it was just given to him.

1242
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,880
You were given, huh?

1243
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,880
You think you were granted?

1244
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,880
You didn't have to develop anything.

1245
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,880
Absolutely.

1246
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,880
We've seen the sensors again as external things.

1247
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,880
Because if I think about my eye,

1248
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:40,880
I see that as an external thought by my facial eye.

1249
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,880
The problem there is that in regard to that thought,

1250
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,880
you're having like a tacit, implicit assumption

1251
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,880
that the eye is something more internally.

1252
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,880
So you can think of those things.

1253
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,880
Why do you at the same time assume to find your eye

1254
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,880
in the direction of internal inside of you or whatever.

1255
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,880
But if you look at yourself in the mirror,

1256
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,880
that eye that you see in the mirror,

1257
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,880
that is that eye because of which you're able

1258
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,880
to look at that eye in the mirror in the first place.

1259
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,880
That very reflection there of that flesh-y organ

1260
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,880
is that object.

1261
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,880
So you're saying it doesn't go further than what?

1262
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
There is no further than that.

1263
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
It closes upon itself.

1264
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,880
The assumption takes you further into infinity whereby

1265
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,880
you would see the reflection of yourself

1266
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,880
seeing the reflection of yourself seeing the reflection

1267
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,880
and think, wow.

1268
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,880
But actually, all the whole thing would be swept in a second

1269
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,880
if you remove the flesh-y eye, if you destroy it.

1270
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,880
So that whole infinity of your perception

1271
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
or whatever else, it's impermanent.

1272
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,880
It might be infinite, but it doesn't last forever.

1273
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,880
Why? Because if flesh-y eyes gone.

1274
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,880
Excellent death, sickness, aging, whatever.

1275
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Gone.

1276
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,880
The whole infinity is gone.

1277
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,880
Your sight is gone.

1278
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,880
Why? Because that flesh-y eye was that because of which

1279
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,880
the whole domain of sight was present.

1280
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,880
So that's why that's it.

1281
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,880
And you'll never see like a one, two, three, four, five

1282
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,880
a linear connection.

1283
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,880
So you have to contemplate.

1284
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,880
You have to fabricate it in the beginning.

1285
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,880
It's abstract, but that's only because it doesn't apply

1286
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,880
to your experience.

1287
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880
But you have to make it apply to your experience.

1288
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,880
We're going to drill in on and on and on.

1289
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,880
Drill in a throat, literally.

1290
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:36,880
Establet, define it, think it, and then establish it.

1291
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,880
The thought that those flesh-y organs are that

1292
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,880
because of which I am alive here thinking, intending,

1293
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,880
looking, smelling, touching.

1294
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,880
Those flesh-y organs disappear.

1295
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,880
All of this cannot remain standing even for a split-second longer.

1296
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
And in the beginning, it's an abstract thought.

1297
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,880
But you keep drilling it.

1298
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,880
Then it will stay longer and longer and longer.

1299
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,880
And then when it stays longer enough,

1300
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,880
you start seeing things through that thought.

1301
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,880
You start seeing things through the right view.

1302
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,880
When it takes root.

1303
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,880
When you say those senses, those senses of

1304
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,880
nothing more than what I experienced now.

1305
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,880
That is the senses.

1306
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,880
What I say, the flesh organ, that worth.

1307
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,880
I think that is it.

1308
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,880
That's something you also see through your senses.

1309
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,880
But that you can know that is that because of which

1310
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,880
your senses are there in the first place.

1311
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,880
Turning.

1312
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,880
Well, it's here.

1313
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,880
Yeah, it's like kind of closes upon itself.

1314
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:54,880
It doesn't go, it's not anywhere else, out of there.

1315
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,880
Right there, right now.

1316
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,880
You can look yourself in the mirror.

1317
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,880
Look at your eyes in the mirror.

1318
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,880
And you'll see how you assume,

1319
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,880
like as if you were behind them inside somewhere,

1320
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,880
left or right.

1321
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,880
But if you then don't let your thought

1322
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,880
or rather if you anchor your thought

1323
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,880
in that reflection of that flesh organ

1324
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,880
as the original determination.

1325
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,880
Yeah, that's our solution.

1326
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,880
Yeah.

1327
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,880
So if you look yourself in the mirror

1328
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,880
and you see your eyes,

1329
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,880
and then you can okay this whole like the face

1330
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,880
and the reflection, the nose and stuff,

1331
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,880
you can kind of see that,

1332
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,880
okay, that's just organ.

1333
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,880
But pin it down to the eyes in your eyes

1334
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,880
and you kind of think the life is behind that

1335
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,880
eye, your sense of self, you are.

1336
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,880
But if you look at it,

1337
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
and what you see,

1338
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,880
you see a black circle,

1339
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,880
a blind dot.

1340
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,880
In the center of the flesh,

1341
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,880
you all know.

1342
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,880
And you realize,

1343
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,880
that's it.

1344
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,880
It stops there.

1345
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
It starts there, it doesn't go beyond there.

1346
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,880
It's that flesh that I'm looking at,

1347
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,880
is that because of which I'm able to look.

1348
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,880
So there are two dimensions,

1349
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,880
simultaneous pleasant.

1350
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,880
One is this material dimension of the flesh eye,

1351
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,880
and the one is like simultaneously present dimension

1352
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,880
of awareness in regard to it.

1353
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,880
But there is not a collinear that behind the eyes

1354
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,880
it goes and you look in eyes

1355
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,880
at whether the window is a soul.

1356
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,880
And they're just a flat wall.

1357
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,880
And it's so cool.

1358
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,880
The soul is in front of it.

1359
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,880
The thoughts are in front of it.

1360
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,880
They can't access that measure.

1361
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
They can't enter it.

1362
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,880
They separate the main.

1363
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,880
But it's that assumption of that quick eye movement

1364
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,880
that makes you,

1365
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,880
well, it makes you maintain that assumption.

1366
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Sorry, it's not assumption of quick eyes move fast.

1367
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,880
It helps you maintain that assumption easily.

1368
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,880
Because your intentionality is measured by the movement.

1369
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,880
Things you do.

1370
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,880
Things you intend with your body,

1371
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,880
your body, your speech, your mind.

1372
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,880
Say your whole body is paralyzed.

1373
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,880
You can always like move the eyes.

1374
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,880
It's basically when the eyes are motionless,

1375
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,880
well, it's dead.

1376
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,880
Like eyes are dead.

1377
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,880
But even those eyes,

1378
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,880
the quickest movement,

1379
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,880
it's still just a flesh yoga.

1380
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,880
In the same sense, your hand is,

1381
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,880
your nails are, your hair is.

1382
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,880
Your spectacles are, your robes are.

1383
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,880
Flesh, material, matter,

1384
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,880
rupa.

1385
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,880
But this matter is that because of which

1386
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,880
there is that awareness in regard to it anyway.

1387
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,880
In the first place.

1388
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,880
So it's just like two completely separate

1389
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,880
domains of matter

1390
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,880
and then awareness in regard to the matter

1391
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,880
is separable from each other.

1392
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,880
You can't have one without your inconceivable.

1393
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,880
You can't just think of matter because in a sense,

1394
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,880
you're thinking of matter

1395
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,880
which means there's awareness in regard to matter.

1396
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,880
No, can you just have pure awareness,

1397
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,880
which is ridiculous.

1398
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,880
Can you have pure awareness

1399
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,880
if your matter is destroyed?

1400
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,880
You can't.

1401
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,880
You can't.

1402
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,880
You can assume that there is a pure awareness

1403
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,880
that divine and whatever else,

1404
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,880
there isn't.

1405
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,880
But you see yourself in regard to your body?

1406
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,880
Yes, certainly.

1407
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,880
It will always remain an assumption

1408
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,880
because you can never find out.

1409
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,880
That there is an assumption,

1410
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,880
an assumption,

1411
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,880
a sorry, an awareness

1412
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,880
free from your

1413
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,880
free from the material

1414
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,880
aspect of life

1415
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
of your body.

1416
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,880
There isn't.

1417
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,880
Not in good faith,

1418
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,880
that is,

1419
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
because you can't,

1420
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,880
if you look at it,

1421
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,880
if you look at your experience as a whole

1422
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,880
and even if you conceive it,

1423
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
no matter how pleasing that conception is,

1424
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,880
that your awareness can be separate,

1425
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,880
the very reality of your practice

1426
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,880
of the present moment shows you that,

1427
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,880
well,

1428
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,880
I'm thinking that my awareness is separate

1429
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,880
while I'm all determined,

1430
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,880
but this matter,

1431
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,880
thus, I'm not separate.

1432
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,880
So you can only assume it,

1433
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,880
in the same sense,

1434
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,880
you can only assume the matter

1435
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,880
as independent of you.

1436
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,880
Because that's a thought,

1437
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,880
which is you,

1438
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,880
in that sense.

1439
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,880
So that's why a matter

1440
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:24,880
finds footing.

1441
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,880
It finds footing,

1442
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,880
basically, in your experience.

1443
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
Because you provided,

1444
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,880
you assumed it.

1445
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,880
But if you see,

1446
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,880
the flesh-y eye,

1447
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,880
he's saying pure matter.

1448
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,880
Well, the four great elements find footing,

1449
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,880
which is how you conceive

1450
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,880
the existence of matter.

1451
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,880
So you assume the eyes are yours,

1452
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,880
means those eyes have found the foot,

1453
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
those flesh-y lumps,

1454
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,880
organs have found the footing,

1455
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
they exist for you,

1456
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,880
their mind.

1457
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,880
But as I said,

1458
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,880
all you're going to see,

1459
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,880
flesh-y eyes,

1460
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,880
moving left or right,

1461
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,880
whatever,

1462
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,880
with a black iris

1463
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,880
in the center.

1464
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,880
But all of that is out there.

1465
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,880
There is nothing,

1466
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,880
like if you go through

1467
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,880
that black iris,

1468
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,880
you just find, you know,

1469
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,880
blood and liquid,

1470
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,880
whatever else,

1471
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,880
eyes have.

1472
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,880
So there is no,

1473
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,880
there is that direction of matter,

1474
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,880
and that's it.

1475
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,880
If you drill further,

1476
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,880
you'll find a matter,

1477
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,880
more matter,

1478
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,880
or same matter,

1479
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,880
depending on how generally

1480
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,880
you look at it.

1481
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,880
So what you have to do

1482
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,880
is stop assuming

1483
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
that you are behind that matter.

1484
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,880
And you can stop assuming

1485
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,880
that you are behind that matter,

1486
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,880
if you drill long enough

1487
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,880
thought that you are not

1488
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,880
behind that matter,

1489
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,880
where you have to keep drilling it,

1490
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,880
and drilling it,

1491
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
and drilling it

1492
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,880
until it takes the root.

1493
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,880
And when it does,

1494
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,880
then see you're unized,

1495
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,880
your own movement,

1496
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,880
your own senses will not

1497
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,880
reduce the assumption

1498
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,880
of self behind those senses.

1499
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:22,880
So there is both of that.

1500
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:29,880
It's not descending into the mouth.

1501
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,880
That's a whole.

1502
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,880
Not descending into your eyes.

1503
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,880
Not descending into eyes.

1504
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,880
Not descending into matter.

1505
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,880
Not taking up matter.

1506
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,880
Not assuming it.

1507
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,880
But in more practical terms,

1508
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,880
being mindful of your body as a whole

1509
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,880
means your mind won't descend into it.

1510
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,880
So to speak,

1511
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
whereby you end up acting

1512
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,880
performing bodily acts

1513
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,880
carelessly.

1514
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,880
Not descending into your mouth.

1515
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,880
Literally, your mind

1516
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,880
not descending into your mouth,

1517
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
will make you aware of what you're saying

1518
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,880
and what is coming out of your mouth.

1519
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
So you won't make you act carelessly.

1520
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
And then not having your

1521
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,880
chip that descends

1522
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,880
like in your own mind.

1523
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,880
Not getting complacent there,

1524
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,880
which means that even your thoughts

1525
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,880
you'll be aware of

1526
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,880
and you won't be thinking carelessly.

1527
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,880
Because if you don't descend

1528
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,880
or mindful in a proper way

1529
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,880
of your mind as an external

1530
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,880
seeing it externally,

1531
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,880
in a proper way,

1532
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:46,880
just holding that way of seeing.

1533
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,880
Then you start really

1534
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,880
talking about giants.

1535
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,880
So that's...

1536
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Yeah, yeah.

1537
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,880
Like if you make a practice out of it

1538
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,880
out of establishing your mind

1539
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,880
well upon those certain things,

1540
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,880
like thinking and pondering,

1541
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,880
overcoming the speech determination

1542
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,880
and so on, then yeah.

1543
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,880
But there are many different ways

1544
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,880
of establishing your mind.

1545
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,880
Janas are just one of them.

1546
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
Like you know, establishing your mind

1547
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
upon the perception of forest.

1548
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,880
So when you're going to town,

1549
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,880
none of the perceptions

1550
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,880
that come from the town

1551
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,880
can access you,

1552
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
or bother you,

1553
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,880
or cause you harm,

1554
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,880
because your mind is

1555
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,880
establishing upon the

1556
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,880
great perception of forest.

1557
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,880
Then you recognize,

1558
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,880
okay, so I'm free from the disturbances

1559
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,880
that come based on the perceptions

1560
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,880
from the town.

1561
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,880
But if there are perceptions

1562
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,880
that if there are disturbances

1563
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,880
coming on a kind of perception

1564
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,880
in the forest,

1565
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,880
I will be disturbed.

1566
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,880
So why don't I develop my mind

1567
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,880
and establish my mind

1568
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,880
upon something even greater?

1569
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,880
So that then even forest

1570
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,880
cannot disturb me.

1571
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,880
So then you can establish your mind

1572
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
upon the perception of Earth.

1573
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,880
Very establishing your mind

1574
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,880
on the perception of Earth.

1575
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,880
Does it mean actually

1576
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,880
holding the perception of Earth

1577
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,880
infantibly, personally?

1578
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,880
No.

1579
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,880
It's basically finding it,

1580
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,880
like discerning it in things.

1581
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,880
So then you don't need to hold it

1582
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,880
because it's already implied

1583
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,880
in those things.

1584
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,880
You're not fabricating anything.

1585
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,880
You're not creating it.

1586
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,880
The most obvious,

1587
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,880
maybe a bit crude example,

1588
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
would be, well,

1589
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,880
what is town

1590
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,880
and forest

1591
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,880
and the mountains

1592
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,880
and the oceans

1593
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
for that matter

1594
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,880
having common.

1595
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,880
Yes.

1596
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,880
Yes.

1597
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,880
Well, it's in the reason thing.

1598
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,880
Right.

1599
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
What is there the reason thing?

1600
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,880
Those are the reason things.

1601
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,880
What are they having common?

1602
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,880
Well, they do having common the fact

1603
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
that they're on Earth.

1604
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,880
They're part of Earth.

1605
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,880
They have the solid aspect.

1606
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,880
That phenomenon of solidity

1607
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,880
or immobility

1608
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
or Earth,

1609
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,880
you want to call it,

1610
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
you establish your mind upon that.

1611
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
It's an abstraction now

1612
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
because your mind is unestablished.

1613
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
But if you have it at the background

1614
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
of your mind,

1615
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,880
like anchored in the notion of solid

1616
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
in everything,

1617
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,880
even the runny water,

1618
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,880
your mind will get established.

1619
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
That's how the casinos work,

1620
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,880
in the same sense.

1621
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,880
That's what casinos are.

1622
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,880
So you would establish your mind

1623
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,880
in something that comes

1624
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,880
on a particular level

1625
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,880
can disturb you

1626
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,880
because your mind

1627
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,880
has been established

1628
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,880
to that much greater

1629
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,880
element of solidity

1630
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,880
in everything

1631
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
particular that you're experiencing.

1632
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,880
So you literally surpassed

1633
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
the whole domain of particular things,

1634
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,880
which is everything,

1635
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,880
or whatever.

1636
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,880
But if you

1637
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,880
have had a thought

1638
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
like the other,

1639
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,880
well, you establish your mind

1640
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,880
on a thought-general thought.

1641
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,880
So any thought that you have,

1642
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,880
or you establish your mind

1643
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,880
on mind.

1644
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,880
Well, there would be the casinos consciousness,

1645
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,880
which is the most refined of all of them

1646
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,880
and they would come kind of last.

1647
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,880
The thing is,

1648
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,880
you can just establish your mind

1649
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,880
upon the general experience

1650
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,880
as a whole right here right now.

1651
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,880
But make sure that it's not divorced

1652
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,880
from that material aspect.

1653
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
The material end of it,

1654
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
so to speak.

1655
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,880
So that's why,

1656
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,880
if you come from the material end of it,

1657
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,880
you'll make sure you don't overlook it.

1658
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,880
So you are here now.

1659
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,880
If there is any disturbance to arise,

1660
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,880
it would be on account of your presence here.

1661
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
On the head,

1662
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,880
or in the central street,

1663
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,880
I'm going this area,

1664
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,880
or whatever.

1665
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,880
Obviously,

1666
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,880
now you have, like,

1667
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,880
phones,

1668
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,880
emails,

1669
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,880
stuff like that.

1670
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,880
So disturbance can arise.

1671
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,880
But again,

1672
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,880
even that would arise

1673
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,880
through your current situation here.

1674
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,880
Basically,

1675
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
on account of your senses,

1676
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,880
on account of things

1677
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,880
that can actually be through your senses.

1678
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,880
You can abandon your senses.

1679
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,880
But then nothing that enters your senses

1680
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,880
will pertain to you,

1681
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,880
it will pertain to the abandoned senses.

1682
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,880
So it's not yours,

1683
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,880
not your problem,

1684
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,880
not your suffering.

1685
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,880
So that's why there are many different ways

1686
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,880
of establishing your mind,

1687
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,880
but it's the same principle

1688
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,880
of establishing your mind.

1689
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,880
That's why the Buddha,

1690
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,880
when he spoke about the casinos,

1691
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,880
he would go out,

1692
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
otherwise,

1693
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,880
manage to establish

1694
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
his mind upon the great element of earth,

1695
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,880
on account of that,

1696
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,880
he abandoned everything in failure to it.

1697
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,880
And what is inferior

1698
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,880
to the phenomenon of earth,

1699
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,880
that thought of earth,

1700
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,880
gender of earth,

1701
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,880
you basically,

1702
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,880
anything more particular

1703
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,880
than that is inferior

1704
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,880
to that phenomenon of earth.

1705
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,880
And then he said,

1706
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,880
but obviously,

1707
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,880
he can be still

1708
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,880
liable to disturbance

1709
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,880
on account of that,

1710
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,880
gender of phenomenon,

1711
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,880
obviously,

1712
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,880
it's much less disturbance

1713
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,880
than the particular.

1714
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,880
This disturbance,

1715
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:58,880
as they can arise,

1716
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,880
if you're not

1717
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,880
established upon the element of earth.

1718
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,880
But then,

1719
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
that thought that has seen

1720
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
the gratification,

1721
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,880
the tension,

1722
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,880
this cave,

1723
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,880
in regard to the casinos of earth,

1724
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,880
seen that he knew it,

1725
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,880
and he won't be on through that knowledge,

1726
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,880
so he's not bothered

1727
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,880
by the either.

1728
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,880
So, yeah,

1729
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,880
there is establishing mind upon a casina,

1730
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,880
or whatever,

1731
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
and then there is no event,

1732
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,880
as well.

1733
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,880
So in time,

1734
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,880
it's very just not descending into a thing.

1735
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,880
Well, not, yeah,

1736
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,880
not collapsing,

1737
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,880
mindfulness,

1738
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,880
or like,

1739
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,880
and collapsing mindfulness,

1740
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,880
doesn't mean that, you know,

1741
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,880
you need to constantly keep your mind in front of you.

1742
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,880
No, it means you need to anchor your mind.

1743
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
So, you can,

1744
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,880
whether you're talking now,

1745
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,880
sit,

1746
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,880
standing,

1747
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,880
walking,

1748
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,880
anybody posture,

1749
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,880
means the body is there,

1750
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,880
means,

1751
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,880
the earth element is there,

1752
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,880
means,

1753
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,880
the water element is there,

1754
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,880
means,

1755
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
the fire element is there,

1756
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,880
means,

1757
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,880
the air element is there.

1758
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,880
You can take any of it.

1759
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,880
They're kind of slightly more defined,

1760
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,880
but,

1761
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,880
you can just be,

1762
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,880
sorry,

1763
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,880
you know,

1764
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,880
you don't even take any of them,

1765
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,880
it's just take the body,

1766
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,880
the body is there.

1767
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,880
That's enough.

1768
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,880
You don't even have to take the body,

1769
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,880
just take this kind of posture is there,

1770
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:19,880
when that posture changes,

1771
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,880
take that posture is there,

1772
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,880
because that's the thing.

1773
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,880
Whatever these step-onses

1774
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,880
can enter you,

1775
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
right now,

1776
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
you would be,

1777
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,880
while you're sitting.

1778
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,880
It would be,

1779
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,880
while your body is seated,

1780
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,880
the senses are liable to such and such.

1781
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,880
So, you anchor your mind,

1782
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,880
in the seated position of your body.

1783
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,880
When you get up,

1784
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,880
you anchor your mind.

1785
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,880
Or,

1786
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
you anchor your mind

1787
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,880
in the notion of the body is there.

1788
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,880
And obviously,

1789
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,880
if you are thinking it in front of you,

1790
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,880
you're not anchored.

1791
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,880
You're anchored when you stop thinking it,

1792
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,880
when you're just discerning it,

1793
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,880
when you're just seeing it

1794
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,880
in the background of your mind.

1795
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
Then,

1796
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,880
that's what means being anchored.

1797
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,880
Literally,

1798
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,880
you throw an anchor,

1799
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,880
and then you forget about it,

1800
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,880
because you're anchored.

1801
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,880
But you know that it's there.

1802
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,880
You don't have to keep pulling it out and throwing it.

1803
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,880
You don't have to keep holding onto it,

1804
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,880
because it's anchored.

1805
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,880
Okay, leave.

1806
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,880
Let the boat float,

1807
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:14,880
left and right,

1808
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,880
whatever it wants to go.

1809
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,880
If it goes too far,

1810
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,880
it starts dragging the anchor,

1811
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,880
I,

1812
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,880
if it's easy to be anchored,

1813
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,880
then restart it.

1814
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,880
Reestablish your mind.

1815
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,880
And I'm not talking about

1816
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,880
four, like sitting, you know, cross-legged,

1817
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,880
and I'm talking about

1818
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,880
daily life,

1819
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,880
anchoring your mind,

1820
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,880
because that's what establishing your mind is.

1821
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,880
Like, he enters and abides,

1822
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:38,880
the first genre.

1823
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,880
He enters and abides this.

1824
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,880
He establishes his mind,

1825
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,880
like, enters and abides the perceptions of forest,

1826
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,880
and then he goes to the town

1827
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,880
for picked up out of whatever else,

1828
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,880
and he's not bothered by anything in that town,

1829
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,880
because his mind is still fully anchored

1830
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,880
in the perceptions of the forest.

1831
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:54,880
So it's no question

1832
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,880
of acting and doing stuff

1833
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,880
while you're establishing,

1834
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
because that's how it works.

1835
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,880
That's what establishment means.

1836
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,880
Now, it's like,

1837
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,880
oh, I can establish my mind only

1838
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,880
when I don't do anything,

1839
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,880
clock the door,

1840
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:17,880
and just sit and stare at the wall.

1841
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,880
Because it's discerning,

1842
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,880
the more general.

1843
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
So whether you're here

1844
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,880
or there or here and there,

1845
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,880
that means your body has to be there.

1846
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,880
Have a notion of your body.

1847
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,880
Let it be as remote as it wants to be,

1848
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,880
but have it present in the back of your mind,

1849
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,880
what are you doing other things?

1850
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
And that's the important bit,

1851
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,880
while.

1852
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,880
Because that's how you can discern

1853
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,880
this principle of simultaneous presence.

1854
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,880
Now, but I'll stop this

1855
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,880
because I'm doing that.

1856
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,880
You stop only on wholesome stuff.

1857
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,880
Because that obviously

1858
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,880
undermines the whole picture.

1859
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,880
But then,

1860
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,880
while you're anchored,

1861
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,880
or even if you don't do anything,

1862
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,880
that's a form of doing.

1863
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,880
Okay.

1864
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,880
I am refraining from activity,

1865
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,880
which is my current activity.

1866
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,880
So while my mind is anchored,

1867
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,880
established in the presence of the body there,

1868
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,880
I'm refraining from any particular activity.

1869
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,880
Fine.

1870
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,880
As long as you're mindful.

1871
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:21,880
In that correct sense.

1872
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,880
Not mindful like in a,

1873
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,880
like modern psychology sense,

1874
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,880
or whatever new age sense,

1875
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,880
or just be mindful.

1876
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,880
Mindfulness needs to be understood.

1877
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
The principle of anchoring needs to be

1878
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,880
a bit sati-patanas.

1879
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,880
And for that, you need the right view.

1880
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,880
So while you're sitting here,

1881
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,880
thinking trying to formulate the next question,

1882
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
or the same more to glorification,

1883
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,880
you can still have a vague distance

1884
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,880
and the biggest notion of your body present

1885
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,880
at the back of your mind.

1886
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,880
And that's practice of anchoring.

1887
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,880
Because that doesn't require the direct effort.

1888
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,880
Because if it's a direct effort,

1889
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,880
it means it's not anchoring.

1890
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,880
So yeah, you start with the direct effort,

1891
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,880
only to leave it

1892
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,880
and kind of seep in the background

1893
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:17,880
with our losing sight of it.

1894
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,880
And eventually it becomes effortless

1895
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,880
because you can't lose the sight of it.

1896
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,880
Because the particular instances of this body

1897
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,880
are maintaining the nature of

1898
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,880
bodies there.

1899
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,880
So it's right there in front of you.

1900
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,880
Anyhow.

1901
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,880
The earth element is right there

1902
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,880
for as long as you're alive.

1903
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,880
So you have to keep thinking about it.

1904
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,880
But you need to let it go in the background

1905
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,880
and then just certainly there.

1906
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,880
And when it's certainly there,

1907
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,880
then well, that kind of becomes a foreground almost.

1908
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,880
Your mind is established.

1909
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,880
You see the boundary.

1910
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,880
If something is present,

1911
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,880
you see the boundary, I think.

1912
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,880
What do you mean?

1913
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,880
You see the body.

1914
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,880
Everything else is happening.

1915
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,880
But what do you mean by boundary?

1916
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,880
I guess the extent.

1917
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,880
Ah, the extent of it.

1918
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,880
Well, whatever is happening,

1919
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,880
whatever is happening,

1920
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,880
whatever might happen,

1921
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
it will happen for as long as

1922
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,880
or on account of the presence of the body right here right there.

1923
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:24,880
Right now.

1924
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,880
So you don't just say,

1925
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,880
you don't have to chase after it.

1926
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
You don't have to, oh,

1927
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,880
how did this happen in the past?

1928
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,880
How did you move this head?

1929
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,880
No, you know.

1930
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,880
For as long as,

1931
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,880
that's what an other hand

1932
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,880
would kind of completely remove the ignorance whatsoever.

1933
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
He said,

1934
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,880
any disturbance that is left

1935
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
are on account of this

1936
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,880
like leaking body right here

1937
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,880
until that body breaks apart

1938
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,880
and then even that won't be.

1939
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,880
But that disturbance for him

1940
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,880
is just the disturbance of, you know,

1941
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,880
pain, enduring, and so on.

1942
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,880
Not disturbance in terms of causing him,

1943
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:54,880
suffering and duke,

1944
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,880
he's beyond that.

1945
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,880
He's just a nuisance.

1946
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,880
Any nuisance that was left

1947
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,880
is on account of this body

1948
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,880
for as long as it's functioning.

1949
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,880
And that breaks apart.

1950
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:04,880
That's it.

1951
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,880
There won't be another body taking up.

1952
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,880
Does it?

1953
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,880
Yeah, things like,

1954
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,880
if one does practice correctly,

1955
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,880
well, there's no assumption.

1956
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,880
There's no assuming.

1957
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,880
The senses.

1958
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,880
You're practicing in a way.

1959
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,880
So, mindfulness is not becoming confused.

1960
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,880
You could experience nibbana.

1961
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,880
Yeah.

1962
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,880
But it's not about experience nibbana.

1963
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,880
Yeah.

1964
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,880
But it's not established.

1965
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,880
It's not established in exactly.

1966
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,880
Yeah.

1967
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,880
That's why,

1968
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,880
putugenus can experience nibbana.

1969
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,880
It's nibbana.

1970
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,880
But because the putugenus

1971
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
there won't be a nibbana.

1972
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,880
But in terms of experience,

1973
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,880
it is that which nibbana is.

1974
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,880
That's that.

1975
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,880
Imagine my hundred.

1976
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,880
Oh, I forgot.

1977
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,880
Long time ago.

1978
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,880
Hundred and something.

1979
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:06,880
Hundred and twenty.

1980
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,880
Twenty, maybe.

1981
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,880
When he said that,

1982
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
when he talks about different,

1983
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,880
different establishments

1984
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,880
that putugenus can have,

1985
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,880
but because he conceives them

1986
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,880
to be his, for him,

1987
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,880
he assumes them.

1988
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,880
So, he goes to the point,

1989
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,880
where he says,

1990
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,880
he thinks,

1991
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,880
I am, this is nibbana.

1992
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,880
I am nibbana.

1993
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,880
I am entering nibbana.

1994
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,880
This nibbana is mine.

1995
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:29,880
And the Buddha said,

1996
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,880
although,

1997
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,880
that is actually nibbana,

1998
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,880
what he's talking about.

1999
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,880
He is not established in it.

2000
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,880
Not descending,

2001
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,880
nor having it developed,

2002
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,880
because he's still thinking,

2003
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,880
I am.

2004
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,880
So, nibbana is just basically

2005
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,880
experienced without read-aversion delusion.

2006
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,880
Imagine if you establish yourself

2007
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,880
in that twenty-four-seven.

2008
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,880
Until it takes its roots

2009
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,880
and then it just takes,

2010
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,880
it goes off on its own.

2011
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,880
And you can drop the whole thing.

2012
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,880
And there is absolutely no cracks

2013
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,880
in the wall anymore

2014
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,880
that nothing can enter you.

2015
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,880
It's just dumb.

2016
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,880
And that's what nibbana is.

2017
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,880
That's why sometimes

2018
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,880
all the Buddha

2019
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,880
would give would be the general instruction,

2020
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,880
oh, I'm staying from anything unwholesome.

2021
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,880
Cultivate wholesome.

2022
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,880
Thank you, Lord.

2023
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,880
I'm going to retreat now

2024
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:22,880
for three months

2025
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
and practice this profound teaching

2026
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:25,880
just gave me,

2027
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,880
and then they come out,

2028
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,880
and they're all hands.

2029
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,880
Just that.

2030
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,880
Because fundamentally,

2031
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,880
it is just that,

2032
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,880
but you have to stick to it.

2033
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,880
I stick to it to the point

2034
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,880
of complete self-transparency,

2035
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,880
no maintaining of beliefs

2036
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,880
and views on a kind of

2037
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,880
being pleasant to you,

2038
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,880
no maintaining on a kind of

2039
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,880
protection of anxiety

2040
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,880
because you're afraid,

2041
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,880
no maintaining it,

2042
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,880
no maintaining on a kind of

2043
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,880
form,

2044
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,880
well,

2045
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,880
sensuality,

2046
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,880
fear,

2047
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,880
anything.

2048
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
You have to really

2049
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,880
open up internally

2050
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,880
for it,

2051
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,880
and stick to it.

2052
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,880
And it will not do things,

2053
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,880
and then you will see

2054
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,880
it and do it,

2055
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:17,880
and then you know that it's working.

2056
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,880
But yeah, understanding

2057
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,880
what nibbana is,

2058
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,880
like, not just all this,

2059
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,880
but knowing,

2060
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,880
rightly, what nibbana is,

2061
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,880
are in not appropriating it,

2062
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,880
as putuginana.

2063
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,880
It means to become

2064
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,880
a solid one.

2065
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:31,880
Now establishing yourself

2066
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,880
in that nibbana eventually,

2067
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
means becoming another one.

2068
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
Because you're not

2069
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,880
assuming the senses

2070
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,880
as there is a

2071
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,880
restraining the senses,

2072
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,880
guiding the senses in a way.

2073
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,880
Well, guiding the senses in

2074
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,880
a restraining will prevent

2075
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,880
the proliferation of that assumption.

2076
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,880
But obviously, just restraint

2077
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,880
for somebody who doesn't know

2078
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,880
what else to look for,

2079
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,880
you want to mind too much more.

2080
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,880
Yeah, guiding the senses in a sense.

2081
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,880
Guiding so you prevent the kind of

2082
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,880
heaviest that you know,

2083
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,880
you should know a wrongly

2084
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,880
based upon the wrong assumptions,

2085
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,880
preventing them from spreading

2086
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,880
and being establishing

2087
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,880
and just harassing you.

2088
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,880
And obviously, when you are not

2089
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,880
leaking left and right,

2090
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,880
then you'll address what's

2091
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,880
there contained.

2092
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,880
So yeah, that's what is

2093
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,880
strained.

2094
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,880
CLI has to come first.

2095
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,880
And if I read the translation,

2096
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,880
I'm dying calm.

2097
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,880
I'm dying.

2098
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,880
Because things are not

2099
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,880
wavy, you know,

2100
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,880
pushed around in the bushes.

2101
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,880
You see the extent of things.

2102
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,880
And that's not going to

2103
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:56,880
jump in over there,

2104
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,880
assuming more than there is.

2105
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,880
Yeah, the proliferation.

2106
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,880
From left and right,

2107
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,880
up and down.

2108
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,880
Fueled by design and craving

2109
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,880
and confusion and doubt.

2110
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,880
And all the other features.

2111
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:35,880
And all the other features.
