WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.240
No, especially in the beginning, like when you actually start developing the concept

00:14.240 --> 00:21.480
of celibacy or the idea that this is what you should be striving at, they come a point

00:21.480 --> 00:26.920
the whole world will feel upside down when it comes to that, like any confidence that

00:26.920 --> 00:32.320
you build and whatever else, it just completely gets undone. And yeah, one look at it, one

00:32.320 --> 00:40.400
eye content, it's enough to crack it, completely overwhelmed you. For a good, well, in the beginning

00:40.400 --> 00:47.440
at least, it will blow down to enduring it, not pursuing it in any way, and also not

00:47.440 --> 00:52.440
pursuing it physically, not looking for the loophole, and then as the as the suitors would

00:52.440 --> 01:00.240
often say, seeing the danger in the slightest fault, and that means like if you have an attitude

01:00.240 --> 01:05.160
of looking for a loophole, even if you're not necessarily pursuing any loophole that you

01:05.160 --> 01:11.680
might find, that attitude is already on hold some state of looking for a loophole, means

01:11.680 --> 01:16.160
ah, you're not seeing the danger in the slightest fault, means you're looking for a letter

01:16.160 --> 01:21.720
of the rule to keep you from breaking it, or to allow your loophole, while actually you

01:21.720 --> 01:27.640
should look for the origin of such action, which is your own mind, which is whether it's

01:27.640 --> 01:32.440
rooted in wholesome, or unwholesome. And if you're looking for a loophole, it's definitely

01:32.440 --> 01:36.600
rooted in a wholesome, because you know, like there was that, I was just talking with

01:36.600 --> 01:42.480
Tanya the other day, and ah, you know, the rules for the monks evolved, they were not

01:42.480 --> 01:51.640
always 200, and ah, 27, there was 150 before, or less, and ah, there was the whole, ah,

01:51.640 --> 01:58.680
the whole point was, they were kind of a product of circumstances and so on, but they were,

01:58.680 --> 02:03.920
they were the basic principles, the A-principles, for example, are the basic principles, and

02:03.920 --> 02:12.880
they were, they were, they were, that monk couldn't keep all 150, whatever it was, and I thought

02:12.880 --> 02:15.600
that it was before others, the former, and he went to the Buddha and said, it's too much,

02:15.600 --> 02:20.360
I'm going to this rope, because I can't keep all these rules, ah, and then the Buddha

02:20.360 --> 02:24.000
said, well, you can just keep the three rules, don't do anything unwholesome, by body, by

02:24.000 --> 02:29.240
speech or by mind, and that's it. Or then another occasion, when Mahvajapati went to

02:29.240 --> 02:34.480
ask the Buddha for a brief instruction before she goes for a little retreat, and so she

02:34.480 --> 02:37.800
can commit to the practice, and he said, whatever you know, it's unwholesome, abandoning

02:37.800 --> 02:42.040
whatever you know, it's wholesome, don't look out for it, and there was enough for her

02:42.040 --> 02:51.200
to become another hand, because it comes down, all the way down, deep inside, to your thought.

02:51.200 --> 02:56.080
Obviously, you have to have enough mindfulness established to be recognizing thoughts as

02:56.080 --> 03:04.720
things, as phenomena that has arisen, but once you do, then you can actually see, and

03:04.720 --> 03:10.400
it's not, if you do see the level, it won't require them, it's much harder to restrain

03:10.400 --> 03:14.480
after your thoughts have been taken up, your level of the speech has been taken up, and

03:14.480 --> 03:19.640
ah, you're just kind of not quite doing unwholesome things with your body, so you're just

03:19.640 --> 03:24.560
enduring this buildup. But when you go back down to where your thoughts are, it's literally

03:24.560 --> 03:30.600
just like with the stream, where the river just originates, when it's a tiny little stream,

03:30.600 --> 03:34.240
and then it doesn't require much effort to stop it, but it doesn't require discernment

03:34.240 --> 03:44.040
to spot it. So, when you go to the origin, if you say, that is where you can see that

03:44.040 --> 03:49.780
you are responsible for. Oh yeah, that's when you see that you are the one making

03:49.780 --> 03:59.840
unwholesome or unwholesome, accepting unwholesome, ignoring wholesomeism and so on. So, in

03:59.840 --> 04:04.120
the beginning, you have to kind of start by like, you know, crude restraint, just not

04:04.120 --> 04:09.640
doing, not looking, not saying whatever else, but that's like, that's far from being a

04:09.640 --> 04:14.360
goal in itself. You do all of that just to eventually, through practice of mindfulness

04:14.360 --> 04:17.880
and reading the sutras and developing and understanding of the Dharma, you can start

04:17.880 --> 04:23.600
distinguishing these things in your thoughts already rooted in it. And if at that level

04:23.600 --> 04:29.480
you address and literally just abstain from unwholesome on the level of the thoughts, that's

04:29.480 --> 04:37.000
already like a straight path in itself. But that really does mean throughout the day,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.800
you have to be mindful of your thoughts and then when you recognize it, unwholesome thoughts

04:40.800 --> 04:45.280
just, you don't tolerate it. Doesn't mean you shouldn't be feeling like this or you

04:45.280 --> 04:50.480
should, oh, these thoughts are wrong, I was a big mistake. No, you're nothing to do

04:50.480 --> 04:55.680
with their arising, thoughts arise and cease. You have to, a lot to do with, exactly,

04:55.680 --> 05:00.880
with their accepting, like you accept the pleasing ones, you don't accept ones, you don't

05:00.880 --> 05:04.800
accept ones, you don't want. But then you change the criteria, when you reach to their

05:04.800 --> 05:09.600
level, you change the criteria. So, it's not any more what I want, what I don't want,

05:09.600 --> 05:14.800
it's what I know it's wholesome and what I know it's unwholesome. So, whatever it's unwholesome,

05:14.800 --> 05:20.880
you don't want it. And the Buddha said, the deal German, he doesn't entertain such thoughts,

05:20.880 --> 05:26.320
he doesn't indulge in them, he doesn't welcome them, he doesn't wish for them. And so on,

05:26.320 --> 05:32.080
which means they might have a reason, but by him not entertaining them in any shape or form,

05:32.080 --> 05:40.800
this is. So, no engagement with unwholesome has taken place. And if no engagement of unwholesome

05:40.800 --> 05:47.680
takes place at that very deep root level, where it's certainly nothing can kind of, of the same

05:47.680 --> 05:52.480
kind, happen further down the stream. Why? Because the stream hasn't been polluted in its origin,

05:53.200 --> 05:56.720
it means even at the very end it will be still the clean wholesome streams.

05:59.440 --> 06:05.200
So, and that pertains to any type of thoughts, whether it's, when it type of unwholesome thoughts,

06:05.200 --> 06:12.720
whether it's essential thoughts, thought of ill will and anger, malice, thought of delusion,

06:12.720 --> 06:19.040
like just just thoughts that are kind of revolving on indolence, laziness, indulgence of any kind.

06:20.320 --> 06:26.000
You know that those unwholesome thoughts and you accept them. And that's how the five hindrances

06:26.000 --> 06:32.960
work as well. They arise on their own. They're like almost manifestations of, you know, having a

06:32.960 --> 06:41.040
body. The body gets tired, the body gets excited, the body gets agitated and so on. But you enter

06:41.040 --> 06:53.440
painting that. What was that was it? That's, that's a double wing moth. It sounds like a double wing

06:53.440 --> 07:00.160
plane as well. So, basically by, but the five hindrances, by not entertaining them,

07:00.160 --> 07:08.160
they cease to be hindrances. They cease to be obstacles. And the mind rises above them.

07:08.160 --> 07:12.400
That's what's bothering me, I'm entertaining it. It's just that. Yeah, you are, you are.

07:12.400 --> 07:20.240
It's, it's certain in the beginning. I do, I do at times I would like force myself not to pursue it.

07:21.200 --> 07:25.920
I further carry on with it, like, you know, whatever I'm, I've been thinking thinking and, you know,

07:25.920 --> 07:31.440
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not carrying forward with this forward. And, you know, it makes some effort,

07:31.440 --> 07:36.160
but I do it. And I feel a bit, please, like, you know, a bit happy or whatever, but,

07:38.160 --> 07:49.120
and I see that I had to keep doing it. And, you know, but it's just the fact that my day is spent

07:49.120 --> 07:56.480
just on that, just struggle that, like, either pursuing it or struggling with it. You know,

07:56.480 --> 08:00.800
I'm not doing it practically anything else. Yeah, well, that's, that's basically the,

08:01.280 --> 08:08.640
the environment you live in. The, you know, the, the common household, it exposure to, you know,

08:09.920 --> 08:14.640
pretty much any sensual aspect you want, food, music, entertainment.

08:14.640 --> 08:25.600
So, you need to, yeah, you need to re-evaluate, see how serious you are. And then you have to change it,

08:25.600 --> 08:31.760
you have to take that leap, that step, and then change it. And by changing, I mean, you go to the

08:31.760 --> 08:40.240
environment that doesn't support such an easy access to those things. So, it's a, it's a risky step,

08:40.240 --> 08:45.760
obviously, but then again, like, yeah, you can choose to stay and then what? You're not going to live

08:45.760 --> 08:52.480
forever, you know, way down. So, what, you're just going to be setting and indulging every, every

08:52.480 --> 08:57.680
window, the risers, and giving completely in, which is the hating yourself. The day before that,

08:57.680 --> 09:04.080
the day before that. Yeah. No, the thing that I see myself developing in a way, like, as you said,

09:04.080 --> 09:09.440
like that, the rest of the sensual stuff, I'm doing pretty decent. Like, even the food-wise,

09:09.440 --> 09:15.200
at times I see, like, I'm trying to, you know, trying to enjoy, and I like, I'll take a step back,

09:15.920 --> 09:23.040
you know, and like, music and the other really, and to say, and, you know, other sensual stuff,

09:23.040 --> 09:30.000
I'm handling well. Yeah, the problem is, you will not, if you're waiting for yourself to feel,

09:30.000 --> 09:35.680
like, oh, I am ready now, they'll never come. Actually, I think I'm really afraid,

09:35.680 --> 09:43.920
it's going like, because this is probably like my, from going to Australia, that's probably my,

09:43.920 --> 09:50.160
I'm on the opportunity, I can't, can't invest again, I don't have the money. Yeah, I know, I was in the

09:50.160 --> 09:55.760
very, very, very similar position. I mean, I had one shot at it. I don't want to, like, go there,

09:55.760 --> 10:02.880
and I see, you know, if I see some, you know, women coming, stay at them, or whatever, and offend them,

10:02.880 --> 10:09.760
and, you know, do some opportunity. Yeah, yeah, all that, all that is a little risk. So,

10:10.800 --> 10:16.000
that's just something you have to, well, you have to accept really, and then face it,

10:16.000 --> 10:21.200
exactly, and then be stronger than it. Because if you wait, or I'm just waiting for the circumstances

10:21.200 --> 10:26.880
to be right for me to feel ready to go, it'll never happen, because, you know, your whole mind

10:26.880 --> 10:33.040
is taken by matter, which means it'll never make you ready for it. It's always going to be something,

10:33.040 --> 10:39.520
and often you have, I mean, I've seen so many people coming to monasteries over the years,

10:39.520 --> 10:46.640
and they always kind of come and sort of are looking for a place, but they have the attitude of,

10:46.640 --> 10:50.960
they're looking for a perfect place, they're looking for a place that will do the practice for them,

10:51.920 --> 10:56.160
which means they'll never find that place, which means they'll never actually start the practice,

10:56.160 --> 11:03.520
and they know that. You kind of, by putting the responsibility for the practice onto circumstances,

11:03.520 --> 11:10.400
be it a place, or if everything falls in place, I can really go and do it or what else,

11:10.400 --> 11:18.800
you'll never do it. It will never be perfect. Why? Because your judgment of perfection is actually

11:18.800 --> 11:26.560
skewed. It's, it's unhulsing. So what you're waiting to be perfect can never happen, because

11:27.440 --> 11:31.840
if it will happen, means that the matter would encourage you to practice, and they will never

11:31.840 --> 11:38.800
happen. The matter will never encourage you to go against them. It will always make it hard,

11:38.800 --> 11:43.920
whenever you choose to go against the stream, which is why it's referred to as against the stream.

11:43.920 --> 11:50.800
So that against the stream starts from the very first step. So you might be inspired about it,

11:50.800 --> 11:56.320
you might have determination to do it, but it will never be, oh yes, I'm going with the grain now,

11:56.320 --> 12:01.840
and I'm practicing, no, it always has to be against it, which is why it's risky, it's not a

12:01.840 --> 12:08.240
guarantee, it's a success. So you don't really know when you do make that step, whether you made it too

12:08.240 --> 12:15.840
soon, or whether, you know, am I too late, or is it just, but then at the same time, well,

12:17.040 --> 12:22.400
you don't really know what too soon is, you don't really know what too late is. One thing you know

12:22.400 --> 12:28.160
is, it's going to be hard, and one thing you know is, well, you can always prevail, and that's it.

12:29.040 --> 12:34.000
So if you fail, it's not because it was too soon, it's not because it was too late, it's because

12:34.000 --> 12:39.840
you failed, it's because you didn't prevail, you didn't overwhelm you, you didn't overwhelm it,

12:39.840 --> 12:46.960
and that's it, the development, exactly. So you know enough, I'm not like not specifically

12:46.960 --> 12:54.560
look like one knows enough, you have the idea about the monastic life, what it entails,

12:54.560 --> 13:00.960
what the priests are, where the practices to be found, and that's it. So you might be doubt,

13:00.960 --> 13:05.520
so whatever else, but all that comes from those hindrances I was just talking about.

13:06.400 --> 13:13.600
So it all boils down whether you succeed or not in the end, and for that you are solely responsible.

13:14.160 --> 13:21.440
For as long as your senses, your faculties are intact, you still have your life and so on,

13:21.440 --> 13:27.520
means there's absolutely no reason to not succeed. So if you don't succeed then yeah,

13:27.520 --> 13:31.680
you'll have this reason, and that reason, too soon, too late, and this, and that,

13:31.680 --> 13:35.280
if you succeed, none of it matters. Why? Because none of it matters to begin with.

13:36.720 --> 13:40.720
If the practice was truly depending upon circumstances, as well, to be done,

13:42.960 --> 13:48.640
you wouldn't be able to do it. So unless your faculties are impaired,

13:50.800 --> 13:56.960
anything like that happens, then yeah, there's nothing really stopping you from doing it,

13:56.960 --> 14:06.800
it's just very strong enough or not. I see, I see a lot of similarities with any sort of like

14:06.800 --> 14:17.040
intoxicant, like, you know, I see myself trying to stop, then yeah, like, and, well, actually,

14:18.880 --> 14:23.680
the nature of addiction is well within the nature of sensuality in general. Addiction is just a

14:23.680 --> 14:31.920
particular manifestation of the nature of sensuality. Any addiction is just a more concentrated

14:31.920 --> 14:41.040
manifestation of what actually nature of sensuality is. I see myself like wanting one last

14:41.040 --> 14:55.680
hit, one last time, and when I get there, I won't know. I see what you mean, like, unless I take the

14:55.680 --> 15:08.160
step, it doesn't really seem going to change. You might like, oh, it's just one last hit of whatever

15:08.160 --> 15:15.440
was providing me with a hit, and then I'll do it. But that was already, like, flowed attitude to

15:15.440 --> 15:22.800
begin with. That hit is something that, once you get it, well, now there is a prospect of another

15:22.800 --> 15:28.720
last hit, because this was not last anymore. It was last before you'd done it. Once you've done it,

15:28.720 --> 15:32.960
well, now is a possibility of another hit, which is, oh, well, there will be the last hit.

15:32.960 --> 15:40.880
So you never stop. So you realize, well, the only way to stop is to stop. The last hit won't stop

15:40.880 --> 15:48.720
you. The first hit, the hundred won't know. The way to stop is to stop, and not give importance

15:48.720 --> 15:55.200
whether it's a beginning of the hit, end of the hit, or middle of the hit. Now you stop independent

15:55.200 --> 16:02.480
off the hit. And that's what I was just saying about circumstances. You stop regardless of

16:02.480 --> 16:07.360
the circumstances, whether it's, whether it feels like I was just halfway through this or through that, now,

16:08.160 --> 16:08.640
just stop.

16:14.880 --> 16:21.600
Yeah, you have to go above it, I guess, I think, to become, yeah, you have to take the range really and do it.

16:21.600 --> 16:28.880
Because otherwise he's just riding you around. Yeah, you can't, you can't have someone who's

16:30.000 --> 16:39.120
an Aryan or a noble, noble person who is being led by his caretaker. Oh, come, you know, he's

16:39.120 --> 16:47.120
not like that. An Aryan is a strong person. Yes, he's not, he's not weak. And so by the beginning

16:47.120 --> 16:53.040
of the argument, you always have to do, you know, you have to go above things, they're basically

16:53.840 --> 16:57.360
anything that promotes that. Yeah, that's why the Buddha would say, and this is like, you know,

16:57.360 --> 17:01.280
whatever was to be obtained by the manly effort, manly exhaustion, I have a pain.

17:02.640 --> 17:09.200
It's got nothing to do. And there isn't a greater manly effort than going against, you know,

17:09.200 --> 17:16.480
yourself. The going against the entire grain. And then all we're powering, there's another

17:16.480 --> 17:26.000
sutra where the Buddha says the mind of the Aryan doesn't overwhelm him, he overwhelms his mind.

17:27.760 --> 17:33.920
Means whatever arises in the mind, he's strong in the neck. Obviously that strength can't

17:33.920 --> 17:39.680
come to his force. He's going against it. It comes through like direct discern, full insight,

17:39.680 --> 17:46.800
which which all the power is, isn't it? What about like faith in like the beginning, you know,

17:46.800 --> 17:53.760
you've done it. Faith is necessary in the beginning. Obviously not faith is not a goal in itself

17:54.960 --> 18:01.360
as it is in Christianity and many other religions. It's just faith that there is hope,

18:02.160 --> 18:08.960
that if I make the effort, I can be free. So I have faith in that. I have faith that my efforts are

18:08.960 --> 18:15.200
leading me the right way. But then when you know for fact, when your efforts are confirmed,

18:15.840 --> 18:22.320
when you know that you are on the right way, then the faith is automatically, well faith disappears.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.480
Because you don't need to believe that you're on the right way when you know that you're on the

18:26.480 --> 18:33.200
right way. So confidence, knowledge replaces the faith. And the sutras refer to as confirmed

18:33.200 --> 18:39.600
confidence. It's sort of when it gets and then develops further and further and further.

18:44.480 --> 18:49.040
When it just went for the light, that is a big thing, isn't it?

18:49.040 --> 19:03.760
It's just a big thing, isn't it? Well, it's actually two phases. And then ultimately for an

19:03.760 --> 19:12.640
other hand, you know, he has no faith anymore because he became fully developed in regard to

19:12.640 --> 19:26.800
dominant practice. He completely went against the grain and now he can't. He just can't be overwhelmed

19:28.320 --> 19:33.040
in a sense. He can't be brought back with the grain anymore. He can't be pulled everywhere.

19:33.040 --> 19:43.120
He just went beyond. Like the noble aid for path goes against the grain and then for an other hand, he goes beyond

19:43.120 --> 19:48.400
the noble aid for path. So grain against the grain and then there is completely going over it and

19:48.400 --> 19:50.240
that's it. You can't get back.

19:50.240 --> 20:05.440
Do some, like I asked myself, I can say with central thoughts. Well, I've asked myself in fact,

20:05.440 --> 20:16.880
do I want to actually get beyond those things? Do I really want to go beyond that? Do I want to be free

20:16.880 --> 20:25.280
from sensuality? And then yours, yeah. Well, there's a good reflection and it reminded, you know,

20:25.280 --> 20:31.760
on a daily basis because as I was just saying, any form of sensuality in a wholesome is being

20:31.760 --> 20:38.240
entertained, which is why it's present. It arises on its own. But if you're feeling a central pool

20:38.240 --> 20:44.560
of any kind or a pool of ill will or anger means up, you have already accepted it. You've already

20:44.560 --> 20:52.080
entertaining it. So then the reminder, well, hold on. Do I want to go beyond this genuinely? Yes.

20:52.880 --> 20:58.560
Then you'll well, then entertaining it becomes more obvious and then you you kind of won't do it.

21:01.600 --> 21:06.400
Obviously, you know, the more you do it, the more like the more you refrain from entertaining the

21:06.400 --> 21:12.800
more the more of practicing that inside, then you become more proficient at it and it gets easier.

21:12.800 --> 21:18.720
But in the beginning, yeah, it's just like really enduring it when it arises and then trying to

21:18.720 --> 21:27.520
make the most of it when it's not present. Most of it in terms of practice, I mean. But you're like,

21:27.520 --> 21:33.600
what is what is sensuality ever done for you? You throw your arm

21:33.600 --> 21:43.840
endlessly. Yeah. And you've had it. You've had it before. What more is it going to do?

21:43.840 --> 21:49.360
You know, what is it going to achieve? We're just talking about it a few minutes, I think,

21:49.360 --> 21:58.240
before we start, is according like any form of sensuality of any sense kind of has its

21:58.240 --> 22:05.520
combination like taste, sound, touch. So you realize it's never going to be more than that.

22:06.800 --> 22:15.280
So what then differs is just like having different ways of arriving at that combination.

22:17.040 --> 22:21.680
Like different ways of obtaining taste, different ways of obtaining touch, different ways of

22:21.680 --> 22:30.880
obtaining sounds, smells and so on. So it's just like it becomes an indulgent

22:30.880 --> 22:38.800
anticipation of something that you've been through many times before. So then that's why you need

22:38.800 --> 22:46.400
to like people kind of become really like connoisseurs of how really taking slowly, sorry,

22:46.400 --> 22:52.240
because if you just arrive at the end of it, it says, oh, that's it. So you have to build up that

22:52.240 --> 22:57.280
anticipation, that delight. And that's what sensuality is, delighting in the prospect.

22:58.800 --> 23:06.720
So that's why a lot of people spend lots of time masking and developing various elaborate ways

23:06.720 --> 23:14.640
of arriving at something plain and simple. Like just a combination of the pleasure of any particular

23:14.640 --> 23:20.080
sense. And that's it. That's all. If you approach it like that, then it's quite flat actually.

23:21.360 --> 23:27.520
So you have to refrain from that attainment, not from delighting in the prospect of it.

23:29.360 --> 23:34.000
And attaining it, you know, teasing it, leaving it for longer. So then you can kind of have

23:34.000 --> 23:39.920
greater pleasure. But again, the nature of that pleasure inherently will always remain the same

23:39.920 --> 23:50.160
and can never be anything more than that. And you know, obviously the extent people go

23:50.160 --> 23:56.880
for the central pleasure is just having family and children, everything. It all comes as a result of that.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.360
And those are serious commitments, serious actions that affect other people.

24:02.240 --> 24:06.080
But it all touches, oh, I want the kids, I want this, I want family, I want people,

24:06.080 --> 24:12.640
next to me, I want companions, whatever else. And it's a form of just kind of

24:13.360 --> 24:18.080
getting to that pleasure. You commit to all sorts of things to great extents.

24:19.280 --> 24:24.320
And then when you get it, then you live as well. Now you're too deep in to just leave it all out.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.920
Why? On a kind of sensuality. You just went too far.

24:27.920 --> 24:35.760
To admit it, it took too much on. The burn is too heavy and you can't turn away from it anymore.

24:37.760 --> 24:42.720
But even then it's not impossible. Like it's easier when you don't have many things

24:42.720 --> 24:48.160
pulling you back in terms of responsibilities, but say even if you're a king of the ruler of

24:48.160 --> 24:55.680
the entire country with lives and kids or whatever else. Again, nothing stops you from a decision

24:55.680 --> 24:59.680
made in a moment to just leave it all behind. As the Buddha did.

25:07.040 --> 25:14.000
Let alone, if you have much less responsibilities and opportunities as he did,

25:14.000 --> 25:32.400
all people like it. Like becoming an anticipator, like being professional anticipating things.

25:32.400 --> 25:39.920
Yeah, that's really what runs people's lives, anticipation, which is, you know, delight,

25:39.920 --> 25:46.080
like you delight at the future prospect. Oh, I'm going to like I'm about to have this. I'm

25:46.080 --> 25:52.000
going to have it. That anticipation, like always having something in stores. It's how people

25:52.000 --> 25:57.920
live their entire lives. Whether in terms of relationships, whether in terms of, you know,

25:57.920 --> 26:06.320
cross-family, career, ambition, achievements, money, obviously, like anticipation,

26:06.320 --> 26:14.960
making money, learning, studying, learning, whatever else. Just all of those things are forms of

26:14.960 --> 26:19.600
anticipation, right? But if you just stop and think you're doing this, well, there is never an

26:19.600 --> 26:25.200
arrival to anything, because that anticipation is actually almost a goal in itself.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.360
Yeah, that's what you do. That delight is what centrality is. That anticipation is the

26:29.360 --> 26:36.560
centrality. It's not the pleasure that you get from it. It's that pool and being shackled by that

26:36.560 --> 26:43.920
anticipation. That's what centrality is. Pleasure is just pleasure. It fully pertains to the senses,

26:43.920 --> 26:49.760
and that's it. But that anticipation is that is something for which you're responsible. The

26:49.760 --> 26:59.520
you're entertaining, the you're engaging, and the driving around completely. Desire and lust, in regard to the things,

26:59.520 --> 27:05.680
the light, and the prospect of pleasure. That's what centrality is. Not the actual pleasure.

27:08.240 --> 27:15.760
So yeah, what is the point? What is what is what do you get from giving up centrality?

27:15.760 --> 27:23.680
Well, like, again, that's it. I want to have one last hit because I'm giving it up forever.

27:23.680 --> 27:27.520
That's how it feels in the beginning. But if you stop and think about it, you realize, well,

27:28.800 --> 27:37.040
what you give it up forever is the anticipation revolving around chasing things up,

27:37.040 --> 27:42.640
this kind of hope and expectation. The actual pleasure that was always pertaining to the senses

27:42.640 --> 27:47.680
remains on the level of senses, and you don't mind giving that up because it was just that.

27:51.760 --> 27:57.280
But the fear arises when because people are dependent upon anticipation and having this kind of

27:59.200 --> 28:04.000
something in store, like something waiting, something hopeful to happen.

28:04.000 --> 28:13.600
And giving that up feels you be dreaded, feels with anxiety, because like, oh, well, boredom is like

28:13.600 --> 28:18.720
nothing then. It's just this. It's just plain boredom. There is no pleasure here at all.

28:18.720 --> 28:23.120
Because for you, pleasure is the pleasure of anticipation, and that is the unwholesome pleasure.

28:26.080 --> 28:32.400
Like craving for underlying tendencies, craving for more. Which means whenever there is anticipation,

28:32.400 --> 28:37.120
there will be more anticipation in regards to that. More delight, breathe more delight.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.680
And that's why it's unwholesome.

28:42.960 --> 28:48.800
So only from the point of view of that, giving up pleasure feels like fearful, feels you with fear.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.960
It seems like hope. But only the beginning. Yeah, because it feels like you're giving up hope.

28:53.920 --> 28:58.720
But that's the thing. If you persevere for it, and not even that long actually, you realize, well,

28:58.720 --> 29:04.960
the senses, they're ultimately the only thing that can experience this pleasure are still there,

29:04.960 --> 29:10.880
whatever. So you don't really, like, they will not use to begin with. So you don't fear giving up

29:10.880 --> 29:15.360
their pleasure, because they'll have something else. And they will have other types of pleasure,

29:15.360 --> 29:20.400
they're not unwholesome. Which is why when you start discerning those types of pleasure,

29:21.760 --> 29:27.360
you can, well, that's how you abandon the unwholesome value. But developing wholesome pleasure,

29:27.360 --> 29:34.400
that it's not based on anticipation. Pleasure of peace, pleasure of content, pleasure of

29:34.400 --> 29:42.240
renunciation, all of those forms of pleasure. And you can actually use them to abandon the unwholesome

29:42.240 --> 29:47.920
types of pleasure. So you need those pleasures at least at least. Well, first you need to start

29:47.920 --> 29:55.920
the renunciation. You need to start to emulate it. And then you can start recognizing the pleasant

29:55.920 --> 30:03.280
aspect of it on account of that wholesome pleasant aspect. You abandon the unwholesome pleasant

30:03.280 --> 30:11.520
aspects, which are pleasant pleasures of anticipation, sensuality, delight, chasing, after things,

30:11.520 --> 30:28.080
and so on. And the hope that that provides...

30:28.080 --> 30:35.440
It seems like such a big challenge. There's the biggest, it's the most difficult things to do.

30:35.440 --> 30:43.440
It's overcome, sensuality, it's overcome anticipation, overcome craving. And how many people can do that?

30:44.560 --> 30:50.560
And people have done that. Yeah. Because it takes so much strength to do that.

30:53.440 --> 30:59.200
But it's far from impossible. Yeah, far from impossible, but it's only like,

30:59.200 --> 31:06.240
there's only a few people can do that. You think about it all. How many people there are currently

31:06.240 --> 31:14.400
on the planet? Yeah. Billions are people. And you're the only one. Yeah, you're the only one

31:14.400 --> 31:21.840
or two people in the world. It's actually making the efforts in that direction and keening your mind.

31:21.840 --> 31:29.920
The rest, they become, you know. No, that's a very, that's like using vanity, using

31:29.920 --> 31:36.480
conceit to your advantage. Like I will be the only one free from sensuality. Because of that,

31:36.480 --> 31:41.520
you will be making efforts to free yourself from sensuality and then you can and you will.

31:41.520 --> 31:46.160
And when you free yourself from sensuality, you won't be, I am the only one free, you won't care

31:46.160 --> 31:51.680
about it. If you free from sensuality. So that that vanity they conceit will vanish with it.

31:52.400 --> 31:58.560
But it did make you strive properly. And that everybody can follow their desires.

31:59.600 --> 32:04.000
It's absolutely zero effort involved. Which is why everybody does it.

32:06.640 --> 32:11.920
But then again, you just have to stop and reflect for a just brief period of time and realize,

32:11.920 --> 32:18.000
well, yeah, sure. Following desire desires doesn't require any effort.

32:18.640 --> 32:25.760
But in order to have the availability for my desires, I need to put up with lots of stuff that I

32:25.760 --> 32:30.480
hate, that I don't want, that I want to be associated with, I don't want to have to do.

32:30.480 --> 32:36.080
But I do it just that I can have a moment where I can just let it go and just flow with the desire

32:36.080 --> 32:42.880
that has a reason and kind of, you know, relax. But then you spend 85, 90% of your life just

32:42.880 --> 32:49.040
putting up with stuff you hate, you don't want so that you can get that 5% satisfaction of just

32:49.040 --> 32:53.360
having your own way and satisfying this particular desire or that particular desire.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.760
Yeah, people work the entire week hard so they can completely, you know,

32:57.760 --> 33:01.440
bring angle man over the weekend and that's their whole life.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.440
Be the master of your weekend.

33:03.440 --> 33:09.920
Yeah, exactly, I mean, that's like the course is kind of example, but basically in principle,

33:09.920 --> 33:15.760
that's the protusion as they like. Like, putting up with stuff, why? Because you want

33:15.760 --> 33:19.920
the family, you want the wife, you want the children, well, now I have to support it,

33:19.920 --> 33:25.600
now I have to work for it, now I have to endure lots of stuff you hate because you committed to this.

33:25.600 --> 33:33.760
And you sort of, you think, again, without much reflection or effort,

33:33.760 --> 33:41.920
you recognize, well, with little bit of effort, with 5% of effort, I can have 95% of my time

33:41.920 --> 33:47.200
not putting up with stuff I hate actually being quite free. That's why they would have compared

33:47.760 --> 33:52.320
like life with someone else and especially if somebody would develop wisdom and inside,

33:52.320 --> 33:58.400
like, free as a deer, roaming as a deer, just go wherever you please, whenever you please,

33:58.880 --> 34:03.440
you're your own master. It's basically what everybody dreams of,

34:04.320 --> 34:10.240
but because being too weak in regard to their own desires, they end up making compromises,

34:10.240 --> 34:15.280
they end up being the burden, their ways down on them, and then you're stuck. It crushes you,

34:15.280 --> 34:27.520
eventually. In the beginning, the overcome the defilement, how do you overcome the fear of the

34:27.520 --> 34:35.120
defilement? To overcome the defilement, how do you overcome the fear of the defilement?

34:35.120 --> 34:46.160
Yeah. What do you mean? Like, for example, the sensuality. If you fear, the sensuality takes

34:46.160 --> 34:52.720
you over and even sort of a life. Well, you don't have to overcome. You use that fear to not engage

34:52.720 --> 35:02.320
you sensuality. You develop more until the sensuality frightens you so much that you do not give it,

35:02.320 --> 35:11.120
as seeing the danger in the slightest fault, seeing the threat in the slightest fault, being afraid of

35:11.120 --> 35:19.120
the slightest fault. And then eventually, when you stop giving into those faults, then that fear will

35:19.120 --> 35:33.920
fail. Because now you're confident that you will not give in, thus you're not going to fear.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.200
That is a heavy rain. Yeah.

35:41.200 --> 35:46.320
It doesn't seem like a five-minute rain in Bamborello.

35:50.800 --> 35:58.240
That's right. It's really raining like this now. And that's still dry. That's good.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.800
Hear the trees are not getting hit. No, it's not hitting here. See this tree is not good.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.160
Thank you. Excellent.

36:18.400 --> 36:22.880
I also think that authenticity is such a power, you know.

36:24.560 --> 36:30.080
Like, if you're authentic, the more authentic you are, the more powerful you become.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.280
Oh yeah. You know, literally you become powerful.

36:33.280 --> 36:44.480
Yeah. And then you know, so even for myself, I know if sensuality comes, if the sexual desire

36:44.480 --> 36:50.080
comes up, I have the power to put it out. Exactly. And again, that's good.

36:50.080 --> 36:54.960
I'm the one doing it. I'm the one actually bringing it back. I can fit you to all things.

36:54.960 --> 37:00.800
When you develop confidence in your own power, mental power, then you don't fear. And again,

37:00.800 --> 37:06.640
that's the similarly from the suitors often compared to a lion, like the lion, the king of the jungle.

37:07.760 --> 37:13.440
It doesn't fear any other horse that he hears, the rise. Why? Because he is the king of the jungle.

37:13.440 --> 37:20.720
It's his role that others fear. So when he sleeps there, somebody rolls some other animals

37:20.720 --> 37:26.400
making noise, he doesn't even flinch. Because he knows nobody's coming out. Nobody can come after him.

37:26.400 --> 37:34.080
So that's when the mind develops, any sensuality, anything that rises like on its own,

37:34.080 --> 37:39.920
you don't fear it because you know, up. You won't overwhelm me. I'll overwhelm that if it comes here.

37:39.920 --> 37:56.640
And it doesn't come there.

38:39.920 --> 38:54.720
So you have been maintaining a department for so long. And you have been maintaining that particular

38:54.720 --> 39:01.840
department quite dedicated to the department.

39:01.840 --> 39:16.160
The staff has to be a graduate of sort of a life, to say, coming off that department.

39:17.520 --> 39:23.920
Well, I mean, as I said, you stop things when you stop them.

39:23.920 --> 39:35.520
You're not kind of waning off it, waiting for it to kind of fade out and stop and do the stopping for you.

39:38.160 --> 39:43.280
So yeah, the longer you've been entertaining a particular habit, a fun wholesome time,

39:44.160 --> 39:48.240
it will be harder to give it up. But you give it up when you give it up.

39:48.240 --> 39:54.080
You stop doing it and then you just endure and you have to withstand any pull.

39:55.120 --> 40:00.640
And those pulls can't last forever. They won't last forever. They will last for as long as

40:01.920 --> 40:10.000
the strength of them lasts. And that strength will last depending on how much basically you

40:10.000 --> 40:15.600
invested in building it up, how much you strengthen that habit of an wholesome time.

40:15.600 --> 40:21.200
And once you say no, it will be pulling you at the beginning harder, but then it will fade out more and more.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.360
So you'd all you have to do is remain undeterred.

40:30.160 --> 40:35.520
It is also, I mean, when the Buddha was dying,

40:35.520 --> 40:44.480
and then an undeterred asks the Buddha, says, what should we do in regards to women? How should we?

40:44.480 --> 40:48.320
And he says, don't look at them.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.000
Yeah, don't look at them.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.120
And then, yeah, what if we have to look at them?

40:53.120 --> 40:54.720
Don't we speak with them?

40:54.720 --> 40:57.200
Why don't you speak with them?

40:57.200 --> 41:00.640
Because then we kind of 45 minds and be mindful.

41:00.640 --> 41:09.280
But then what I was interested in is your being mindful, but it seems to me at different stages.

41:10.160 --> 41:14.560
Because why would you want to be mindful if you can avoid it in the first place?

41:14.560 --> 41:19.360
Like why would you want to have to be mindful in regards to it when dealing,

41:19.360 --> 41:22.880
because basically we have to be mindful because that's the way to build with it.

41:24.240 --> 41:29.680
But why would you wait for that long in order to have to deal with it when you can prevent

41:29.680 --> 41:31.600
you from arising in the first place?

41:31.600 --> 41:33.760
Don't look at it. Don't speak with it.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.560
Then be mindful if you have to do it.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.960
And that was like, basically in regards to that question,

41:40.960 --> 41:44.000
was asked women in a sense of sensuality, for men,

41:44.720 --> 41:47.440
are what should you do? Are you should deal with it?

41:49.440 --> 41:54.480
Like, you'll discern, and it's not about testing yourself or seeing it now.

41:54.480 --> 42:00.240
You see, you cut it into two, you don't engage at the level of sight.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.400
You don't engage at the level of speaking.

42:02.400 --> 42:06.560
If you can't avoid that, well, then you'll be mindful as the last resort in regards to that.

42:07.280 --> 42:07.760
But what?

42:07.760 --> 42:12.400
Because actually being able to prevent it, that's already implying mindfulness at proper time.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.000
Having wisdom to discern it.

42:17.280 --> 42:20.560
Ah, I can prevent this, cuts my work in half.

42:20.560 --> 42:29.120
Because when a Buddha is saying, be mindful, he's not, he's talking about right mindfulness.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.560
So it's also someone who knows what that is.

42:32.560 --> 42:33.760
Yeah, exactly.

42:33.760 --> 42:37.760
You've got to know, I can't do right mindfulness.

42:37.760 --> 42:44.320
I don't have right to do, so I have to avoid these things for the time being.

42:45.520 --> 42:46.560
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.240
Yeah, yeah.

42:49.200 --> 42:53.520
Because that result of overcoming this thing, it's still not available.

42:55.280 --> 43:00.160
So you want to basically kind of exclude it then as an option.

43:00.160 --> 43:07.440
And it's in the Hindu tradition, you know, they do seven years of celibacy.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.440
You know, you don't look at women, you don't speak to them.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.480
You're nothing to do with it.

43:12.480 --> 43:20.080
Just to maintain your celibate life, so you can build up this energy and attain some higher status and better.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.280
Because it does, yeah, you have to go through that.

43:26.960 --> 43:31.440
You have to hold back and not be around those things.

43:34.960 --> 43:40.000
So you can actually have a bit of a firm grip on your mind.

43:40.000 --> 43:47.040
Because by not engaging in those things on the level of sight, speech, touch, whatever else,

43:48.160 --> 43:52.160
then your mind can, like, you can know.

43:52.160 --> 43:57.440
Well, encompass it fully as a phenomenal sensuality, attraction, desire, and so on.

43:58.880 --> 44:00.320
By not being engaged.

44:00.320 --> 44:03.360
Because the moment you're engaged with it, well, then already mind is in it,

44:03.360 --> 44:06.720
which means you can be seeing it from a different angle within that.

44:06.720 --> 44:12.880
Which means you can then be possibly seeing correctly how it is to be outside of it.

44:14.640 --> 44:18.000
So you need to actually be outside in order to recognize the view outside.

44:19.200 --> 44:23.520
You can be inside and then you fantasize how it is to be outside, but that's not the same.

44:24.640 --> 44:33.200
So, and again, the similar in the suit does is like being in the water, wet,

44:33.200 --> 44:39.520
having two wet pieces of wood trying to light the fire, but I mean, to get in one work.

44:40.880 --> 44:47.520
So you step outside on the shore, but then you have to wait until that wood dries out,

44:48.320 --> 44:53.440
and then you can start the fire, like light the spark of wisdom and so on.

44:54.400 --> 44:57.600
So yeah, you might have stopped engaging in sensuality, but then you have to

44:57.600 --> 45:02.640
maintain that for a while until the mind dries out.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.880
And then it can discern and see clearly what it is.

45:11.600 --> 45:17.280
You go, you take the pieces of wood out out of the water,

45:17.840 --> 45:23.760
but they're drying out, helps you to see more subtle things where you see, of course,

45:23.760 --> 45:30.800
the origin of these things. It's basically like being wet means your mind is wet,

45:30.800 --> 45:31.840
your thoughts are wet.

45:34.400 --> 45:40.960
And that means it's sort of dampens. There can't be like a fire of wisdom,

45:40.960 --> 45:45.360
energy of wisdom. It can arise because everything is wet, so give it.

45:47.120 --> 45:52.400
So you need to stop making it wet and then you have to, by not making it wet,

45:52.400 --> 45:56.720
you have to persevere in that until it dries out completely.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.080
And then things will become more evident.

46:01.600 --> 46:06.560
I think one of the things that become more evident, I would say, well,

46:08.240 --> 46:14.000
is that sooner when the Buddha talks about giving attention to your masculine features,

46:14.000 --> 46:22.400
to your masculinity, because I find myself if I become not thinking sensual thoughts,

46:22.400 --> 46:26.160
I'm not even saying it as much as I can, you know, I don't do it.

46:27.440 --> 46:37.040
But when I delight in my masculinity, they're implying that I can see it coming,

46:37.040 --> 46:43.680
pushing it or giving it to, how do you say? Pressure really, like. Yeah, funny, you said that,

46:43.680 --> 46:52.560
but I have the same, same, same wishes. But what I find, what I practice with is,

46:53.600 --> 47:00.800
if I do notice that, if I, then I can also either give attention to my masculine feature,

47:00.800 --> 47:06.560
or I feel like powerful in my muscles, or whatever, or I don't, I don't have to do that.

47:07.600 --> 47:14.960
I can feel strong, but I don't have to delight in that. But you need to be dry enough

47:14.960 --> 47:18.560
to be able to see that as well, you know, you can't see that. But I think,

47:20.240 --> 47:25.040
things have to be a bit dry, to see the subtlety. Yeah, but the dry you are,

47:25.040 --> 47:32.160
as I said, the more things you begin to discern, more and more and more, things that you couldn't

47:32.160 --> 47:40.560
have seen because it was a wet. You see where the enemy comes in? Yeah, and that's it. If you come

47:40.560 --> 47:44.880
to that point, then all you have to do is never give attention to masculine signs, which means

47:44.880 --> 47:50.080
they will never be an opening for the attraction in regard to the opposite to a rise.

47:50.080 --> 47:56.560
But it doesn't mean that you become non-masking. No, not at all.

47:57.760 --> 48:02.720
Because in fact, it's what we just spoke about, things, you become very strong.

48:04.080 --> 48:08.720
But it's also not a vanity strength, a rise strength, a strength very based on the physical

48:08.720 --> 48:13.120
appearance of whatever else, is a strength of the mind, which is a different, very different thing.

48:13.120 --> 48:21.280
Yeah, but yeah, it's a valid strength. Well, it's the real strength.

48:30.560 --> 48:36.560
To be honest about why, exactly, the person in my mind doesn't do that.

48:36.560 --> 48:45.920
So, as you said, I'm in the best physical condition I've been in years.

48:45.920 --> 49:04.720
Like, oh, such a waste. Yeah. Yeah, I'm in my prime with something like that.

49:15.920 --> 49:33.200
Yeah, at times I find myself laughing, like, I'm funny, like, the different ways that the mind

49:33.200 --> 49:38.000
approaches the same thing to get it done, like, when it comes to the environment. Yeah.

49:38.000 --> 49:56.880
That's different approaches. And, like, at times when I notice, I'm not complex by how, how,

49:56.880 --> 50:09.520
well, while the cunning, you know, the way the mind approaches the same department, it's just, you know, it's

50:09.520 --> 50:14.640
really laughable. Yeah, well, that's exactly how I'm out of work, really.

50:14.640 --> 50:25.760
And all you have to do is just ignore it. Just don't, don't give a full attention to it.

50:27.440 --> 50:31.440
And, yeah, you'll follow it's course. And if you take you with it,

50:31.440 --> 50:46.400
just turn a blind eye here and there. That's it. Ignore. Ignore it. Ignore it.

50:46.400 --> 51:01.840
Tiredness is sitting in his inventory. It is, yeah. And his heavy rain is not making it easier. Yeah.

51:01.840 --> 51:08.240
I'm sort of feeling that, you know, I start feeling like, oh, I feel like all that happened.

51:08.240 --> 51:17.680
Yeah. But then again. I really say it's one of the ways I'm trying to wipe it. Yeah.

51:18.880 --> 51:24.720
I wore the chopsticks. I wasn't sure. I don't know. It's just a guard.

51:28.160 --> 51:34.720
Well, I was having difficulty as well as when you're watching your mind so closely to see, you know,

51:34.720 --> 51:43.040
whatever you're doing is awesome. You don't want to do that. When it's like, what happens

51:43.040 --> 51:49.120
just you feel, you don't want to, you just want to avoid things. You want to go to sleep rather.

51:49.920 --> 51:54.960
Well, yeah, yeah, that's why the sloth and talk will become a hindrance.

51:54.960 --> 51:59.680
And you see, you see actually how much you don't need sleep. Yeah.

51:59.680 --> 52:07.840
Yeah. You can just keep very little. And the rest of the time it's just I want to just ignore.

52:07.840 --> 52:13.680
I don't want to actually watch my thoughts. I don't want to look at things. That's quite painful.

52:15.680 --> 52:19.920
Well, it can be. It's heavy. Ways in the industry. Yeah. Yeah. The pool.

52:22.720 --> 52:26.320
But again, the thing is with every hindrance, it's actually rooted in the body.

52:26.320 --> 52:35.680
Yeah. So the body does need sleep. The body does get sleepy. The body does get agitated.

52:36.400 --> 52:42.560
The body does get excited. You know, any sensuality experience is completely confined to the body

52:42.560 --> 52:49.680
and bodily senses. So you can, by discerning fully, the extent of, of, uh,

52:49.680 --> 52:57.600
nivarana, the, uh, the hindrance is fully bound with the body. You can actually, you're

52:57.600 --> 53:02.640
surmounted like that. You can never spill over. You can never be anything more than bodily.

53:03.680 --> 53:07.120
So what you have to do is not give into your body and you're going to give into an hindrance.

53:10.240 --> 53:16.000
Well, even the doubt, the doubt, like it's the, the form of the doubt, when you are actually

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
affected by the doubt, it's, it's felt. You experience it in your body.

53:23.920 --> 53:27.120
Like when the doubt takes over you, when you're panicking on a kind of doubt.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.520
Like I'm doing a lingua. Yeah.

53:33.120 --> 53:36.000
So black side is for this. Yeah. Exactly.

53:36.000 --> 53:48.400
It is a, that's the, the two ways. And also it doesn't, I'm not saying that the five images are

53:48.400 --> 53:52.880
physical in terms of their found in your body, like whatever else. I mean, they put

53:52.880 --> 53:57.680
the same to your body. That's what I like. Yeah. It means they put the same to your body,

53:57.680 --> 54:01.520
the body, the bound with the body. They cannot be experienced without the body.

54:01.520 --> 54:09.920
Yeah. But you're saying then, when this, when you recognize one of the five images,

54:11.600 --> 54:18.640
you should recognize it as arising while the body is there, like you recognize it while the

54:18.640 --> 54:22.320
body is there. That's what it means bound with the body. It means to the extent the body is there.

54:23.520 --> 54:26.480
So you can't be found elsewhere independently of it.

54:26.480 --> 54:35.040
Yeah. So the domain, the domain of the five images is always there in regard to the body.

54:35.840 --> 54:42.720
Basically means the domain is, is maintained through the, if you're not free from possibility

54:44.080 --> 54:49.920
of accepting any of the hindrance that arises on account of body. And when you accept it,

54:49.920 --> 54:57.040
when you give into it, when you're affected by it, all of that, that's when it's a hindrance.

55:00.720 --> 55:06.080
If your mind becomes stronger, literally just stronger than the hindrance. So it doesn't mean

55:06.080 --> 55:14.640
that you never experience sleepiness or like the body never gets excited. No. But the mind is always

55:14.640 --> 55:20.560
on every occasion stronger than any of those things. That means you're not taken by, you cannot be

55:20.560 --> 55:28.960
taken up by any hindrance anymore. But let me work in mind, you're seeing it in the right view,

55:28.960 --> 55:34.240
with the right view. Yeah, the right view will take you there and then it's just the development.

55:34.240 --> 55:54.000
You can see the hindrance. So you can be mindful of your thoughts. But you also have to be able to see it

55:54.000 --> 56:00.960
like the same rising with the body. Yeah, you also have to be strong enough to endure the body

56:00.960 --> 56:08.320
basically, with its pulse. But then means you have to have the right view, like the right view.

56:08.320 --> 56:13.360
Well, yes, but also like, if you don't have the right view, it can certainly enable you to have it.

56:17.360 --> 56:22.400
Well, it's along the right line. So if you don't have the right view, you'll certainly develop one

56:22.400 --> 56:32.720
if you practice like this. So how are we apart there? To turn to your body.

56:34.720 --> 56:42.000
Angle. Well, let's see, you could, you could, it pretends to your body internally and pretends

56:42.000 --> 56:47.440
to the body just externally or just to the body. But as long as a body is there, it will pretend to

56:47.440 --> 56:54.160
do it. Because can you be angry with some, with any person without the image of their body, their

56:54.160 --> 57:04.960
appearance, their face, their tokens, their signs, anything physical, inconceivable, inconceivable.

57:04.960 --> 57:09.360
Even if you say, well, I don't hate, like, I'm not talking about hating the physical aspects.

57:09.360 --> 57:14.960
If you hate what somebody said, you can hate them on account. They said, when you have that

57:14.960 --> 57:23.120
phenomenon of hate present, you have simultaneously that phenomenon is bound with the presence of

57:23.120 --> 57:31.360
their bodily image that you have encountered, the face or the entire, whatever. It will be

57:31.360 --> 57:39.600
pertaining to the bodily aspect, which is not accidental then, that giving into hate will result in you

57:39.600 --> 57:46.400
attacking the physical aspect, whether through verbal abuse, if you have even less respect to

57:46.400 --> 57:52.720
physical abuse. So annihilation, destruction of their physical aspect is the satisfaction of your

57:52.720 --> 58:00.160
anger. Same body desire, sexual desire, sexual desire, inseparable from bodily.

58:00.160 --> 58:11.840
Just inconceivable. You can't have it. You either have to have an image of your bodily present

58:12.480 --> 58:17.680
in a form of giving into the notion of your own masculine, or you have to put up there the

58:17.680 --> 58:30.640
image of the external body's presence or both.

58:30.640 --> 58:49.040
Oh, the wind. Nice.

58:49.040 --> 59:01.920
What I just also noticed before I left, I looked at Kindle, looking to see if there's a suit on

59:02.560 --> 59:09.280
watching two types of thoughts, so by discerning wholesome thoughts and wholesome thoughts,

59:09.280 --> 59:17.840
eventually Eoi enters the first time and so on. But also by discerning the five hindrances,

59:19.440 --> 59:24.480
then the entrance is first done. It's the same. It's the same person.

59:26.320 --> 59:34.960
His five hindrances are basically five ways the unwholesome thought can manifest itself.

59:34.960 --> 59:43.520
And over a path in them, it can be unwholesome. So by recognizing the domain of the five hindrances,

59:44.320 --> 59:51.200
you sort of overcome the domain of unwholesome manifestation.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.360
It's what I like is it's just a simple thing. It's a very simple thing.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:13.040
Depending on how far you pursue it, how clearly you discern it, that will determine how far you get.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:25.120
But it is a pressure line, because it's like climbing up, high up on the hill,

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:33.120
how you get them all pressure it gets harder and whatever else, but then there's the world for the

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:40.800
eventually. Because there's always the possibility of pleasure.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.080
But going back to the pleasure that you know, but if you keep going, there will be a point of no return.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:01:00.900
When you know, ah, you will not return, it's impossible for you to return to the pleasure

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.900
that you know.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:07.660
And then as the super say, like the stone that has been split in half, you can never

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:14.340
ever make it one again, or like a dry leaf that came off the tree, it can never be green

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.340
again.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:25.900
Oh, even like, you know, slightly more vivid examples of like, food you vomit it out,

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:48.220
it can not desire anything.
