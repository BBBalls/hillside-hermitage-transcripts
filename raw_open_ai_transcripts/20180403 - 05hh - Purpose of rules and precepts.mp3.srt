1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,880
So, what is the purpose, the rules, the precepts, why do you practice renunciation?

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,920
The purpose of it is developing the strength of your mind and the absolute first step

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:31,240
for that is to be able to say no to yourself, to say no to your desires, wins, habits.

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:39,040
So every, all of the main rules upon which a practice is based is they're very practical.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,520
So to speak functional, necessary in that sense.

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,360
They're not held because of a belief or because of the authority, they're held because

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,440
they're held in themselves, the practice of meditation and development of the mind.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,120
So basically think of the rules as a fertile ground where you can plant seeds of a plant

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
or some trees.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,080
So it's not a tree, it's not a seed, but having a grown tree would be impossible if you

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,960
don't have a fertile ground to do so.

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,000
So in that sense, you see the necessity of the fertile ground, you see the necessity

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,720
of the rules.

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,520
Without them, there's no point if you cultivating seeds and watering the plant when you have

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,360
destroyed the fertility of the ground, when you have compromised the fundamental rules.

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,400
What are you trying to do?

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Sorry?

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
What are you trying to do?

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,480
Well you're trying to grow the freedom, freedom of your mind, because the mind is bound

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,880
by the desire, by the craving, by the feelings.

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,040
Mind is liable to feelings, which means when suffering arises, you won't be able to prevent

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
it.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,560
When pleasure arises, you won't be able but to indulge it.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,400
Means you're controlled by what you feel.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,400
And you're controlled because the mind is too weak in regard to what it feels.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,160
So you want to become stronger than all those things, and the first step to developing of

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,640
that strength is mere restraint, being able to say no, not to everything, forever, but

28
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,840
to certain things that are inseparable from desire, craving, ill will hate anything

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,840
unhoused and basically.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:41,080
Yeah, eating at a certain time, it's again, it's just like you eat because it is necessary

31
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
for the body to remain alive.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,520
But you don't want to be using it as a sensuality, as a form of escape, and then you just keep

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,400
eating throughout the day, eating only what you like and so on.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,440
So you recognize a degree of necessity to eat, and that's what you focus on.

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,040
And yeah, if you eat enough calories once in a day, that's absolutely fine.

36
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,400
There is absolutely no reason to eat more.

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,680
Eating more than what you need is going to be bound to come out of sensuality, out of craving,

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
out of desire.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,400
But it's not a life-threatening hunger.

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,120
So basically in the evening, you have desire to eat, and instead of habitually just giving

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,800
into desire and satisfying it by any means, you force yourself to reflect on it, because

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,280
you know you want to eat, you want to break the rule, so as a form of restraint, what's

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
the alternative?

44
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Well, it's to think, okay, why, how, why am I pulled by this desire, why this hunger

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,160
controlling my mind?

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,520
And that's how you, that's how you go beyond the desire, eventually.

47
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,760
If I ate a meal at night, I started eating, then I'll be free from desire.

48
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:06,200
No you won't, you, you'll be free from hunger, but the hunger was not your desire.

49
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, there would have been no desire without a hunger, but the hunger is not a desire.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,760
Desire is always mental.

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,960
So when the hunger, when the physical state affects, controls your mind, then it becomes

52
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,880
a desire, which means you might go and remove the physical state, but the liability of your

53
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,880
mind to be controlled by the physical state remains, which means next physical thing comes

54
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,280
and you're going to equally be bound by the same desire.

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,560
Hence you don't set, you can't satisfy a desire, and everybody knows that.

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
You can be chasing and engaging in all sorts of sensuality, you can never satisfy a desire,

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
why?

58
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
Because it's not where you're trying to satisfy.

59
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,360
You're satisfied with physical circumstances, but those are not what the desire is.

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,120
Yeah, desire is inseparable from those, but it's not those.

61
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,520
It's not those things.

62
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,880
So your precepts, thanks.

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,960
So the precepts are basically just like laying out the ground where you can practice.

64
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,840
Just putting up a fence, fertilizing the ground, and agreeing upon those things.

65
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,960
As a starting point, you have to start somewhere.

66
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,520
So all the precepts were basically, that's what I mean, they were quite functional in

67
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
that sense.

68
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Ah, you eat.

69
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,800
In the beginning the monks were allowed to eat in the evening.

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,480
It was not specified you don't in the morning, they could eat many times a day.

71
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,520
But then it was sort of becoming impractical for various reasons, going out at night to

72
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,080
collect the food, getting up all sorts of accidents and so on.

73
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,000
So then a rule was brought in, you eat it at the right time, so you don't go out to collect

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,720
food at night to go during the day, then they could still eat at night, but then you stop

75
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
eating at night as well.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,680
You just eat when you go and get the food, it just becomes more practical, easier, and

77
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,320
you don't spend the rest of your day being concerned and planning about the food, you

78
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,480
spend it practicing restraint.

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,200
And practicing wisdom and practicing meditation.

80
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:20,480
Well, those, yeah, the eighth precepts, those are the basis of practice, those are the,

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,120
that's what defines their fertile ground, they're not negotiable.

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,720
Like how can you possibly be practicing the clarity of the mind, developing the strength

83
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,760
of your mind, when you're drinking alcohol, that's clearly directly affecting the clarity

84
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,240
of the mind.

85
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,200
And it has no practical value, like you need to eat some food, you need to meet a certain

86
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,120
degree of certain amount of calories, you don't need to drink alcohol, hence it's always

87
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,200
going to be central reasons.

88
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,560
And even people say, I drink only because people around me pressure me to do so, that's

89
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,880
also central reason, you're basically afraid of affecting adversely the central environment

90
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,200
around you, you don't want to upset anyone.

91
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,920
You don't want to have to be kind of ostracized or whatever by your friends or not, so you

92
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
drink, it's ridiculous.

93
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,440
You're trying to develop the strength of your mind, yet you're giving to the basic weaknesses

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,320
of like, oh, they're laughing at their teasing me, so what?

95
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,160
How can you be beyond suffering, beyond the favorite emotion when someone's mere teasing

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:54,640
is affecting you, and you can't, you can't maintain your behavior, do you hear me?

97
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:03,600
No, of course, it's a further ground.

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,080
You can have all the further ground you want if you don't have the actual well cultivated

99
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:17,040
seeds, and if you don't put the work in maintaining that soil, then they're not going to grow.

100
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,400
Because you have to water it, you have to provide enough sun, you have to work around it

101
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:29,080
once you plant the seeds, but just leaving, just hoping for the soil to do its only one,

102
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,680
to do the work you want, it's just the soil.

103
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,960
So you can have 300 rules, 1000 rules, 5 rules, as many rules as you want.

104
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Right.

105
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,200
It doesn't, it doesn't matter because there's other work that needs to be done.

106
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,360
Yeah, you need to have the rules that cover the necessary basis, and those are basically

107
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,080
what is known as 8 presets, or 10 presets if you want to take it maybe a step further,

108
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
but that's it.

109
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:04,600
Everything else is derived from that basis, it cannot add more to it.

110
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,480
So in that sense, yeah, having 3000 rules, it's not necessary.

111
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,840
If you've covered the basis of these 8 presets, if you don't do anything unwholesome on

112
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,280
the account of the 8 presets, that's it.

113
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,960
You have sufficient basis for complete freedom, from suffering, from feelings, and anything

114
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
else.

115
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,720
What, what, what can you give up here?

116
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,480
What's a basic, what's a basic set, preset, what's anybody can follow?

117
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,240
Don't, right.

118
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,840
Don't kill, don't steal, don't cheat, or preferably.

119
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:56,120
Or ideally, be a completely celibate, leave a completely celibate lifestyle.

120
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:06,040
Don't, well don't, sorry, yeah, don't drink and take drugs, in a sense of don't consume

121
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,040
things that directly affect mindfulness and awareness and composure.

122
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:21,960
So you have to, those are like the five basic ones, and they have to be basically taken

123
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
seriously.

124
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,920
And I'm talking about someone who still lives in the world, but for a month, then you

125
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:38,240
have the 8 presets, you have the non-butification, non-indulgence in sleep, and not eating it

126
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,280
the wrong times, as you not just spend the whole day eating around and thinking about food.

127
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:52,960
So you want to start kind of harnessing your mind basically, harnessing the outposts,

128
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,480
the behaviors of your mind that are founded upon desire and non-restraint.

129
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,280
So basically, you're setting up a fence, tying it down, pinning it down until it comes

130
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
down.

131
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,200
That's what the presets are.

132
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,960
But in itself, it's not enough.

133
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,640
The necessary basis, the container, but then the work needs to be done within that.

134
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,200
Once you fence the yard off for a wild horse, you need to start training it.

135
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:26,720
Yeah, you can't start training it, inconceivable, when you can always run off into the mountains.

136
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,480
But now you fence it off completely, you repair any patches that he was escaping through,

137
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,080
you brought it back, now he can't escape.

138
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,400
You wait for it to calm down, because he will calm down, sooner or later he's going

139
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,960
to get tired of running around in circles.

140
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,880
When it's calm, then you start training it.

141
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,760
But then if you remove the fence and you haven't trained it, it's going to run off again.

142
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,960
So you have to keep the fence until it's fully trained, and when it's fully trained,

143
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,520
then it doesn't matter if the fence stays.

144
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,240
And that's basically the definition of the presets.

145
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,280
So even as a layperson, the five presets are a certain degree of that fence, which is

146
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,200
a good thing, because you are taming down the wild horse, which what mind is really for

147
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
most people.

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,600
So you're taking a bit more control over your own behavior, over your own desires, over

149
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,520
your own sort of impulses that you usually, you can't say no to.

150
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:36,920
Yeah, that's the first step.
