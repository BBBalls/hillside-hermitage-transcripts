WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.240
Well, the same line we were talking about, the hindrances we were speaking about the

00:17.240 --> 00:18.240
other day.

00:18.240 --> 00:28.080
I think belonging to the body was out, I think they cannot arise without the body.

00:28.080 --> 00:39.760
In separable front, and hindrances have been quite what I had to say, we can add eruptions

00:39.760 --> 00:48.480
of mind, weakness of wisdom and it's always at the first you know, if you can abandon

00:48.480 --> 00:52.680
those, I don't know if it means to destroy those.

00:52.680 --> 01:01.680
Well, no, I don't fully go beyond hindrance, whereby any hindrance that arises, it's

01:01.680 --> 01:07.000
not a hindrance for human, because his mind is beyond that, or above them, so they don't.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
But it's true.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.040
Well, no, it's not a hindrance there.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
No.

01:11.040 --> 01:19.640
Say that the body has moods, both the existence of the five arguments has moods, and that

01:19.640 --> 01:25.520
mood is taking, is throwing you about, because your mind is somewhere watching in between

01:25.520 --> 01:30.080
weak and confused in regard to it and appropriating it as mind.

01:30.080 --> 01:34.920
For an arah, it's completely free, free from any appropriation, any conceiving, whatever

01:34.920 --> 01:41.000
else, they truly remain just bodily moods.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
In other words, whatever arises, it won't be a hindrance, and it will never develop to

01:48.000 --> 01:53.160
the extent that he used to develop, because he used to develop, because he was a hindrance,

01:53.160 --> 01:57.720
because he did take it as mind, and then revolve around it even more, and proliferating

01:57.720 --> 01:59.720
it in further.

01:59.720 --> 02:06.200
She'd go and set moods, or whatever, he will last, and then you just, he would take it

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
out of my mind.

02:07.200 --> 02:15.800
Well, yeah, and then becomes mind, but like last, for example, it takes a while, like

02:15.800 --> 02:24.040
sexual desire, for example, it takes a while before, it becomes a full-on sexual desire,

02:24.040 --> 02:31.120
and when I say it takes a while, I mean, it takes some time of attending it wrongly,

02:31.120 --> 02:36.640
giving attention to the sound of beauty, getting wound up, getting excited, and then, yeah,

02:36.640 --> 02:41.840
then you can be in that state perpetually, or state of real will, but nevertheless,

02:41.840 --> 02:47.000
they take time to develop, basically that developing means this kind of revolving, when you

02:47.000 --> 02:53.160
don't have escape from the initial age of sexual desire, which is purely bodily, because

02:53.160 --> 02:58.600
for as long as there is a body, for as long as there is a prostate organ and penis and

02:58.600 --> 03:07.880
everything else, there will be a possibility of an age, and that's all third.

03:07.880 --> 03:13.000
Obviously, the whole significance of the sexual organ's centrality and everything else and

03:13.000 --> 03:17.960
the whole appropriation of that means it's never seen just as an actual sometimes, but

03:17.960 --> 03:24.400
again, even when it is, it's seen as my age, and since there is nothing preventing you

03:24.400 --> 03:30.200
from stopping it, from not indulging it, people don't understand the danger of it

03:30.200 --> 03:37.880
anymore, they do it, maybe not physically, but it do it mentally, they nurture it, they

03:37.880 --> 03:45.240
cherish it, they entertain it, you give it to, well, yeah, you might be resisting, but

03:45.240 --> 03:53.720
let's say a layman, yeah, you pull it, you take on the reins, not just, you go for it,

03:53.720 --> 03:59.600
but it was purely bodily, and he always remains inseparable, imagine if there was no body,

03:59.600 --> 04:04.560
would you be able to experience sexual desire, imagine if there is no mouth, no tongue, would

04:04.560 --> 04:10.760
you be able to enjoy the tasty food, you wouldn't, you couldn't, inseparable from, so any

04:10.760 --> 04:15.040
food that you ever enjoyed, any food that you are enjoying, any food that you will enjoy

04:15.040 --> 04:25.480
is completely bound to your tongue, literally, it's completely bodily, because of that, it's

04:25.480 --> 04:33.720
entirely bodily, because all the other limitations can happen to come and go, but this remains as

04:33.720 --> 04:44.080
a necessary condition, presence of a working time, working eyes, working ears, but that's

04:44.080 --> 04:49.640
not a problem, because if eyes, and what they see would be a problem, if tongue and the

04:49.640 --> 04:55.520
taste would be a problem, removing the tongue would remove the problem, but none of it is

04:55.520 --> 05:06.320
the problem, your mind is not a problem, your thoughts are not a problem, so the craving

05:06.320 --> 05:12.480
in regard to it, the assumption of the body is mind, well, they all comes out of it, mind

05:12.480 --> 05:18.600
and conceit and craving, all the walls are on the same thing, ignorance, you can see,

05:18.600 --> 05:24.920
you take it as yours, you're taking me, then you become, you know, that we chase after

05:24.920 --> 05:31.800
the counterpart, so for as long as you are identifying with your masculine body, masculine

05:31.800 --> 05:39.760
sexual order, masculine possibility of sexual pleasure, of sexual pleasure in general, you

05:39.760 --> 05:43.520
will be bound by that pleasure, even if you are Australian, even if you spend your life

05:43.520 --> 05:49.640
as a celibate restraining, if you don't sever the connection internally, you will remain

05:49.640 --> 05:54.840
bound, you will remain essential domain, I mean, just saying no, but you're not, yeah,

05:54.840 --> 05:59.920
you're not actually freeing yourself right, saying no is the first step, but it's the

05:59.920 --> 06:06.840
first step they cannot enable you to see, you escape, no, it's not you escape yourself.

06:06.840 --> 06:23.920
Because if I step back in reflection, when I look at the body that appears in whatever

06:23.920 --> 06:32.440
form it appears in, it might be a sensation of it, well, if it's a breathing or the,

06:32.440 --> 06:37.280
see, that's already, your body was already there before, because that sensation was being

06:37.280 --> 06:43.600
possible to be manifested because the body was already there, but I don't see it, because

06:43.600 --> 06:49.600
you're not mindful of it, because, and another reason why you don't see it is because,

06:49.600 --> 06:55.840
for you, only that particular manifestation of this or that, the manifest the body is

06:55.840 --> 07:01.160
the manifestation of the body, but if you develop knowledge that actually, any of those

07:01.160 --> 07:06.120
particular manifestations are possible only because the body is already there, that thought

07:06.120 --> 07:11.600
the body is already there, starts to stand, begins standing for that which is the body

07:11.600 --> 07:15.720
in your experience, in other words, that is your body in your experience, there is no

07:15.720 --> 07:16.720
between.

07:16.720 --> 07:21.640
The thought that the body is already there, yeah, because again, would you be able to think

07:21.640 --> 07:26.280
anything about the body, if the body is not standing there?

07:26.280 --> 07:32.040
But you can't know it any other way then, well, exactly, you can't access that through

07:32.040 --> 07:38.600
the senses, sensation, sensations of touch, sight, sound, smell, that's all sensual, that

07:38.600 --> 07:45.440
all comes to senses, and that's usually the criteria of what exists, put in your body

07:45.440 --> 07:50.240
comes to existence much more than that, so, but when you know, all those things are possible

07:50.240 --> 07:54.800
only because the body is already there, and that body is already there, because you're

07:54.800 --> 08:00.360
thinking it, you realize, ah, that's how the mind comes first, because this all precedes

08:00.360 --> 08:06.760
it, that thought of the body preceding them is a real thought, is your body, that is

08:06.760 --> 08:21.200
what your body is, at that level, at that time, again, you can go back to the, so the

08:21.200 --> 08:27.800
put on the mindfulness of the bodily portions, you're seated now, your body is in a certain

08:27.800 --> 08:33.640
position, so whether you look at it, whether I'm telling you about it, whether you're touching

08:33.640 --> 08:42.640
the chair, that's all because you're seated already, and in a sense that cannot, that the

08:42.640 --> 08:51.200
body is seated, is a thought, but then what else would you expect it to be, because all

08:51.200 --> 08:56.280
of the sight, sound, smell, stasis, touches are known because the manifesting mind are

08:56.280 --> 09:05.400
there also thoughts that correspond to respective senses, but sensing itself without the mind

09:05.400 --> 09:17.240
is incomprehensible, so thoughts that concern your sight, are thoughts of your sight, or

09:17.240 --> 09:20.640
of your eye organ, if you want to put it like that, that's why there are six different

09:20.640 --> 09:26.960
types of consciousness, there are six different types of thoughts, you can say it like that,

09:26.960 --> 09:31.920
they're different, they all appear to be looking the same, but they're bound to different

09:31.920 --> 09:43.880
things thus they're different, thoughts about a smell, or it seems just that, thought

09:43.880 --> 09:49.560
about a smell or thought about a sight, it's a thought, and yeah, there is in common,

09:49.560 --> 09:53.960
they're both thoughts, they're both potential to mind, but they're different thoughts, in

09:53.960 --> 10:01.920
the nature, one is bound with the eye organ, another one is bound with the nose, or then,

10:01.920 --> 10:07.720
so a thought of your body being there, mental is bound with the presence of the body, with

10:07.720 --> 10:16.480
a six sense base, with the entire thing, so keeping the thought, you're going to even keep

10:16.480 --> 10:20.120
it actually, that's the thing, that's how you develop mindfulness, it's not constant

10:20.120 --> 10:27.240
keeping in your mind, because I was driving mad eventually, it's recognizing the different

10:27.240 --> 10:31.560
layers of that generality, whereby things appear, so you have particular things while you

10:31.560 --> 10:37.200
are seated on the chair, what you're doing, holding something in your hand, listening,

10:37.200 --> 10:45.560
talking about all of that while you are being seated, but see if you forget that you

10:45.560 --> 10:53.240
are seated, and then you continue on doing things while you are seated, and while I really

10:53.240 --> 10:59.960
lost some mindfulness, but the thing is, you can remember it in a mindful way, they

10:59.960 --> 11:08.120
would make your memory mindful, in other words, you might lose the actual awareness of

11:08.120 --> 11:13.240
your eye and seated on this chair, but if halfway through whatever you were doing, you

11:13.240 --> 11:19.680
remember, literally remember, that you are still being seated, and that is the anchor, there

11:19.680 --> 11:26.840
was the anchor of your mindfulness, that memory becomes mindful, so that which you've done

11:26.840 --> 11:37.280
in that time span, when you forgot, and I remember, that also is rendered mindful, why?

11:37.280 --> 11:44.640
Because the position of a body thrown in the world, random, existing on its own, given

11:44.640 --> 11:50.640
five aggregates, it's something you can never appropriate actually, yet your whole experience

11:50.640 --> 12:02.040
depends upon it, and mindfulness of body, the postures reveal that, position, body, because

12:02.040 --> 12:05.800
of which I can do, I can think, I can worry, I can be angry, I can be happy, I can be

12:05.800 --> 12:13.600
angry, I don't mean because you are seated, because the body is there, seated, standing,

12:13.600 --> 12:24.560
walking, lying down, it's just like a little extra reminder of a body in there, and that's

12:24.560 --> 12:29.840
always the, those are always the foundations of your experience, no matter how great, how

12:29.840 --> 12:34.680
lowly, or how depressed, or how lately your experience might be in general, the fact is,

12:34.680 --> 12:40.760
it all requires a body to be there, but I can recognize the posture, yeah, you recognize

12:40.760 --> 12:44.520
the posture, but the thing is, you can't keep it actually in front of you all the time,

12:44.520 --> 12:47.960
because other things will start arising, because that's just how things work, so that's

12:47.960 --> 12:52.080
another point, everybody can, like the person, the people, the touching, touching, walking,

12:52.080 --> 12:55.600
sitting, sitting, they all recognize in the posture, but that's another point, the point

12:55.600 --> 13:01.040
is to recognize it, and then let it go, let it go where everyone wants to go, and as long

13:01.040 --> 13:05.200
as you don't stand up, you hold those mindfulness of the fact that you're seated, so you don't

13:05.200 --> 13:12.200
actually have to be trying to be mindful, you're mindful, but your body is mindful, which

13:12.200 --> 13:20.480
is how dead mindfulness can, well, can never lapse, or lapsing with dead mindfulness becomes

13:20.480 --> 13:27.640
less and less occurring, so the other one has the supreme mindfulness, why?

13:27.640 --> 13:35.920
Because even when he forgets, that forgetfulness is mindful, because it's in regard to particular

13:35.920 --> 13:42.960
things, but his body is situated there, in one posture, the other, and that's his mindfulness,

13:42.960 --> 13:53.000
but the person has to anchor the cells back and back, in the beginning, he was seated,

13:53.000 --> 13:59.320
and then you find yourself, you drift, you drift off, yeah, okay, but I'm still seated,

13:59.320 --> 14:05.720
and I'm still seated, yeah, see, the problem is, with that, people keep over doing it,

14:05.720 --> 14:09.320
because you don't know which is supposed to achieve, so that's why I said, understanding

14:09.320 --> 14:14.280
mindfulness will make you mindful, so you're seated now, and you're mindful that you're

14:14.280 --> 14:22.480
seated, and now you're drift off, but at any point, or feel drifted out, I ask you, are

14:22.480 --> 14:29.960
you sitting, are you sitting, or are you seated? You would say yes, so the knowledge of

14:29.960 --> 14:35.680
the body position pertains to the body, and it's there, with the body, so that's why

14:35.680 --> 14:42.720
you can afford to forget it, in that mental keeping it in front of me all the time sense.

14:42.720 --> 14:51.760
It's basically recognizing the peripheral, to the extent necessary, that things don't,

14:51.760 --> 15:00.920
to the extent necessary, that forgetting particular things, doesn't induce general non-mindfulness,

15:00.920 --> 15:10.560
you can put it like that, so you might have lost a particular thought that I am seated

15:10.560 --> 15:18.440
here now, but you are still seated here now, which means, even when you were thinking,

15:18.440 --> 15:23.920
I am seated here now, there wasn't your mindfulness, the fact that you were seated right there

15:23.920 --> 15:29.080
and then, that's where your mindfulness was, it could have been.

15:29.080 --> 15:45.880
You see, if I, from time to time, the day I sit down, I do something specific, meditation,

15:45.880 --> 15:52.880
mindfulness, it's a greeting. I say, well, I will, I keep that in mind, I'll be mindful

15:52.880 --> 15:59.880
of my greeting, and I sit there for a while, but then I get up, I think about this, I think

15:59.880 --> 16:07.880
about that. Then I might say, I'll be mindful of my body posture, I'll be mindful of my

16:07.880 --> 16:17.160
feelings, probably mindful of this, but then am I, I feel that I'm aware of my situation,

16:17.160 --> 16:23.160
my surroundings, the state of my mind, but then I have done, am I actually being mindful

16:23.160 --> 16:29.800
of that particular thing? Yeah, because I'm greeting it, because you have to find your

16:29.800 --> 16:35.800
body posture, your breathing, your feelings, whatever you want to be mindful of, you have

16:35.800 --> 16:47.120
to find that within that general situation, not in front of it. So in that general situation,

16:47.120 --> 16:52.120
that's how you have to start. Then within that, without abandoning the image of general

16:52.120 --> 16:58.480
situation, you have to start discerning, feeling, you have to start discerning the presence

16:58.480 --> 17:07.560
of the body. So this general situation, if I, yeah, I feel like I can, I'm aware of the

17:07.560 --> 17:15.880
general situation, but I'm surrounded by it in a way. Yeah, it's in time, yeah.

17:15.880 --> 17:28.640
And whatever, I think of as the body within that best dance of the world, pretty much.

17:28.640 --> 17:36.000
And ever that can be a number of things, but it will all be inseparable from a body.

17:36.000 --> 17:48.960
So ever thought of general situation, if I do have a thought of general situation, is that

17:48.960 --> 17:59.400
not making it in front of me? It depends. Well, it's going to be in front of you, it depends

17:59.400 --> 18:06.400
on how you attend it. If you over-attend it, under-attend it, misattend it. If you over-attend

18:06.400 --> 18:12.160
it, it feels like it's behind me. Yes, that's okay. It can fit behind you. But then, if

18:12.160 --> 18:19.000
you over-attend behind me, that can become in front of you. Because must my mind be split.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.560
Well, it doesn't really matter that much actually. What matters is to develop the sense of the

18:23.560 --> 18:30.560
mindfulness of wild, the two simultaneous layers, if you want to put it that way.

18:30.560 --> 18:43.320
Well, if it is all the bodily and mental, you can put it as crudely as that. But then,

18:43.320 --> 18:51.360
obviously, both bodily and mental are mental in a certain way. But there are mental things

18:51.360 --> 18:57.600
that pertain solely to mental and their mental things that are bodily. Thus, mental is

18:57.600 --> 19:04.280
split into bodily and mental. So, in that sense, everything is, your mind comes first,

19:04.280 --> 19:11.560
just without the mind, it's in Krasil, but not everything is entirely mental. But even

19:11.560 --> 19:16.360
the whole thing of body and mind will not be able to stand if there is no body that

19:16.360 --> 19:23.360
is conscious out there for the end of the minute in the world.

19:23.360 --> 19:32.360
What would you say is, is it partly worth the situation?

19:32.360 --> 19:43.800
Well, it's, yeah, I suppose, because you have to start from the stage of protugener, so

19:43.800 --> 19:50.080
being contacted, everything is manifested. That would be the original situation. But

19:50.080 --> 19:56.320
recognizing the original situation, you can eventually go through it. Literally, the

19:56.320 --> 20:02.280
discernment through it, you know, left, right, the ball will be right through it, and that's

20:02.280 --> 20:06.800
how you cease to regard it as mind. So, then you're not contacted.

20:06.800 --> 20:13.280
But there is two arising. Yeah, so, protugener situation is contact. But situation would

20:13.280 --> 20:20.480
pretend to arise, arising in person the way of the five-year-olds. But if that touches

20:20.480 --> 20:27.480
you, if you make it mind, then you're contacted by it. If it doesn't, then you're not.

20:27.480 --> 20:35.280
Then, if the situation, the general situation, you said that, that's what it is.

20:35.280 --> 20:45.280
So, I guess, before I forget, I forgot it once, what did you say? You can induce the

20:45.280 --> 20:50.280
mindfulness for general situation, and while you're mindful of the general situation,

20:50.280 --> 20:59.280
let your body do things. Walks it, moves about. While you're mindful of the general situation.

20:59.280 --> 21:05.280
Because that indirect way of seeing that body, not directly doing it, but that thing you do,

21:05.280 --> 21:11.280
while you're looking it through the mindful general situation, is one among the bodies,

21:11.280 --> 21:16.280
one among the experience of the bodies. Every mindful of the body.

21:16.280 --> 21:24.280
And that's how point of one upon a satin, through doing breath, you do other things through

21:24.280 --> 21:31.280
this thing, which means, there'll never be directly done, there'll be indirect observe

21:31.280 --> 21:39.280
while they're done. And what you feel there, what you perceive there, what you do there,

21:39.280 --> 21:44.280
is a feeling, is a perception, is something that's been done.

21:44.280 --> 21:49.280
So, you have to start recognizing that indirectly peripheral is seeing something remotely,

21:49.280 --> 21:54.280
still stands for that thing that you're seeing remotely, not just directly in front of you.

21:54.280 --> 21:58.280
That's how mindfulness develops. So, while you're mindful of the entire situation,

21:58.280 --> 22:04.280
your body's seated there, on its own, almost as if it has its own existence,

22:04.280 --> 22:09.280
independent of you and your general situation. So, to speak, not entirely.

22:09.280 --> 22:15.280
But in a way, yes, because you don't have to be sitting to be seated, you're seated.

22:15.280 --> 22:21.280
But there is something the body does, yet you don't have to keep doing it, same with breathing.

22:21.280 --> 22:26.280
You can be doing the breathing, but the body's also doing the breathing.

22:26.280 --> 22:32.280
So, you can be mindful of that breathing as well while you're mindful of the general situation.

22:32.280 --> 22:38.280
So, as if, like, because you're mindful of the general situation,

22:38.280 --> 22:42.280
you can't be fully absorbed 100% into breathing or sitting or whatever else,

22:42.280 --> 22:45.280
and that's the whole point, to not be.

22:45.280 --> 22:49.280
Because then you start recognizing it indirectly peripheral,

22:49.280 --> 22:54.280
which is again, the reason why this whole Vipassana mainstream is completely wrong.

22:54.280 --> 22:59.280
Well, yeah, they believe you can have 100% attention upon the one thing,

22:59.280 --> 23:01.280
and you can't. That's why the frustration.

23:01.280 --> 23:06.280
I think I'm trying, like I said, your mind has to be split, but I'm trying to give 100% to the birds.

23:06.280 --> 23:11.280
Yeah, exactly. Your mind can be split, and then you can be trying to attend that 100%.

23:11.280 --> 23:15.280
And it's impossible, because of all of the different,

23:15.280 --> 23:21.280
because of peripheral and general and infinity of that structure, you can't have one thing.

23:21.280 --> 23:26.280
Or other that structure is one thing, but you can't step outside of it,

23:26.280 --> 23:29.280
and then attend it as one thing. It's impossible.

23:29.280 --> 23:36.280
You can only see it from within, which means if we're already now mindful of it.

23:36.280 --> 23:42.280
Let me see from a certain general situation, being mindful, being aware of it,

23:42.280 --> 23:49.280
and particularly as the body of beings,

23:49.280 --> 23:58.280
and then awareness of the mindfulness that's within that situation.

23:58.280 --> 24:02.280
Yeah, as well.

24:02.280 --> 24:11.280
Which is why, if you do it long enough, the belief that you can be outside of that situation will fade.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.280
And that belief is psychiatry.

24:14.280 --> 24:18.280
Where, by your sense of self, your personality is outside of your experience.

24:18.280 --> 24:23.280
You just assume it, failing to see that that assumption is within this experience.

24:23.280 --> 24:28.280
But if you keep seeing the situation in general, the entire situation,

24:28.280 --> 24:36.280
within that, while your mindful situation, in my body, of what you feel or whatever, partially,

24:36.280 --> 24:41.280
because you don't want to be fully absorbed, which you feel, because you forget about the situation,

24:41.280 --> 24:46.280
then becomes apparent that, well, whatever arises within this, will be within this situation.

24:46.280 --> 24:52.280
And if you do it long enough, you stop assuming that there can be anything out of this situation.

24:52.280 --> 25:02.280
Good evening, your assumption.

25:02.280 --> 25:07.280
Which is how the sense of self is then recognized, but, effortlessly,

25:07.280 --> 25:10.280
and beinglessly within that situation has a phenomenon.

25:10.280 --> 25:13.280
And if it's within that situation, it cannot be the owner of that situation,

25:13.280 --> 25:17.280
it cannot be the creator, it cannot be the master.

25:17.280 --> 25:29.280
So, you abandon out the bother like that, which is the belief that your self is far more superior than your whole experience.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.280
Yes, you can see this.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.280
Because if it's manifested, it's impermanent for ever a reason.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.280
And now you see it manifested.

25:37.280 --> 25:55.280
So, if you're mindful of the situation, I'll stop saying, the situation is general, because the situation is general.

25:55.280 --> 26:01.280
So, if you're mindful of the situation, and then within that mindfulness of the situation,

26:01.280 --> 26:06.280
keep a peripheral eye on what your body is doing.

26:06.280 --> 26:11.280
There won't be anything left out, because whatever arise will be between the two.

26:11.280 --> 26:16.280
And that's what we included in it.

26:16.280 --> 26:21.280
And if you get used to that, or rather if you develop it to the insufficient extent,

26:21.280 --> 26:26.280
then you can also see that they're mutually determining each other.

26:26.280 --> 26:31.280
Your entire situation would not be manifested if this random body is still not alive,

26:31.280 --> 26:38.280
sitting on the chair and breathing, being nurtured by food over our eyes.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.280
And vice versa.

26:40.280 --> 26:49.280
If there is no situation recognized as such, this body will not be manifested at all within it.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.280
You can't even mention it.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.280
You think that's an inconsequential?

26:53.280 --> 26:54.280
Yes, it's inconsequential.

26:54.280 --> 27:01.280
And really, that's the thing, thinking that that's all of the situation.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.280
Yes.

27:04.280 --> 27:09.280
Yes, yes.

27:09.280 --> 27:16.280
In terms of the breath, when I say, I tend to the breath,

27:16.280 --> 27:23.280
and I try to attend to that, as much as I can.

27:23.280 --> 27:28.280
But I think you wrote it in the comments on meditation.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.280
You're just sitting now.

27:30.280 --> 27:36.280
You allow the body and the feet to arise, by themselves,

27:36.280 --> 27:43.280
those feet to merge or arise by themselves, so that you know how long it can see them.

27:43.280 --> 27:49.280
So they know how long it can see, they just arise as they do.

27:49.280 --> 27:56.280
You recognize that with the rise, whether you can see them or not, which means my concealing becomes redundant.

27:56.280 --> 28:01.280
So if I'm looking at the, if I'm dreaming, and I'm planning something like that,

28:01.280 --> 28:08.280
breathing, breathing, breathing, I mean, I'm looking at the body.

28:08.280 --> 28:14.280
Because the body arises and I look at this body, which I'm not supposed to conceive.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.280
That's the feeling.

28:15.280 --> 28:22.280
Well, again, you don't conceive it necessarily, just by thinking that.

28:22.280 --> 28:27.280
Because, as I said, well, if you don't want to put something,

28:27.280 --> 28:30.280
mindfulness of breathing is your situation.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.280
I'm breathing.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.280
That's your situation.

28:33.280 --> 28:38.280
Within that, I'm breathing while the body is like this.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.280
I'm breathing while the body is like that.

28:40.280 --> 28:43.280
I'm going to breathe in while the body will be like this.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.280
I'm going to breathe, feeling this, I'm going to be feeling that.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.280
That's the whole point.

28:48.280 --> 28:52.280
So if you start thinking about a feeling and everything, you can't afford that.

28:52.280 --> 28:56.280
If your mindfulness gets developed to such an extent, whereby an act of breathing,

28:56.280 --> 29:00.280
whether you do it or not, is where it's anchored.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.280
And you are still breathing.

29:04.280 --> 29:09.280
So then when you go back to the breathing, you go back as if it was always there,

29:09.280 --> 29:11.280
because it was always there.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.280
So you're forgetting, becomes mindful.

29:14.280 --> 29:19.280
Well, rather, you're forgetting, becomes within the mindfulness.

29:19.280 --> 29:25.280
So when you remember, everything is rendered as mindful memory.

29:25.280 --> 29:32.280
Mindful memory means memory that will not injure serigen.

29:32.280 --> 29:42.280
We may not ingest it, not...

29:42.280 --> 29:46.280
Well, like, an hour and a half, can remember.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.280
Stuff hit down when he was a pitugian.

29:49.280 --> 29:59.280
But none of those memories will lead you to serigen anymore.

29:59.280 --> 30:04.280
So when you forget about the breathing, but then you become mindful of the...

30:04.280 --> 30:09.280
Well, when your body is mindful then, but the breathing is still happening.

30:09.280 --> 30:13.280
Even if you're going to think about other things, when you get back to...

30:13.280 --> 30:19.280
Or rather, let's put it like this, remembering that you were supposed to be breathing,

30:19.280 --> 30:22.280
practicing mindfulness of breathing.

30:22.280 --> 30:26.280
That act won't be like, oh, I remember something I forgot.

30:26.280 --> 30:31.280
Remembering will just mean bringing you back to the breathing that is already there,

30:31.280 --> 30:35.280
and was already there, and was happening all this time.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.280
Thus, your mindfulness was already there, was already there,

30:38.280 --> 30:41.280
and was happening all this time.

30:41.280 --> 30:46.280
So remembering and forgetting, doesn't induce a region anymore

30:46.280 --> 30:50.280
in regard to where was I, what was I going to start again.

30:50.280 --> 30:55.280
He just means coming somewhere else and coming back to the other thing.

30:55.280 --> 30:58.280
Which is what you do all the time.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.280
But you don't know that.

31:00.280 --> 31:04.280
So when you go somewhere else, you forget.

31:04.280 --> 31:26.280
I, the assumptions of a region, everything else, the upper down, they prepared you to do.

31:26.280 --> 31:30.280
Did you give us a start from...

31:30.280 --> 31:34.280
Tell it really, looking at the situation...

31:34.280 --> 31:37.280
Start the pattern, just take any of it.

31:37.280 --> 31:40.280
You can start with any of it.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.280
Here's the body here.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.280
But there are so many different types of practicing body mindfulness.

31:45.280 --> 31:49.280
Looking at dead corpses, is a form of self-pattern.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.280
Why? Because a corpse.

31:52.280 --> 31:59.280
A corpse in regard to which you feel no lust, you feel dispassion,

31:59.280 --> 32:05.280
can be conceived without standing for a body.

32:05.280 --> 32:10.280
Mine, body of others, body of both, internal external, internal external.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.280
You can't, because it's entire evolution.

32:13.280 --> 32:20.280
So in that sense, would be mindful of the attitude of the expression towards the body.

32:20.280 --> 32:30.280
You're mindful of the attitude of the expression towards the nature of the body.

32:30.280 --> 32:36.280
And you can do that by, again, being mindful of the situation while you're looking at a suba.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.280
So don't go fully looking at a suba.

32:38.280 --> 32:44.280
Like, don't give 100% attention if you forget what you are and what you do.

32:44.280 --> 32:49.280
You're mindful of the situation and then look at a suba.

32:49.280 --> 32:54.280
And keep looking at something you're doing while you're mindful of the situation.

32:54.280 --> 33:00.280
So, peripherally, you are aware of it, but you don't go fully in it.

33:00.280 --> 33:09.280
And then, as such, you start recognizing it through that indirect attention,

33:09.280 --> 33:11.280
which is not.

33:11.280 --> 33:15.280
Well, it's indirect only in relation to what you're used to be.

33:15.280 --> 33:20.280
It's only indirect in relation to that.

33:20.280 --> 33:25.280
But in itself, it's just a different form of attending.

33:25.280 --> 33:33.280
Peripheral attending, without overcommitting, without fully conceiving, without going there.

33:33.280 --> 33:37.280
And that body, that expression that it's manifested at that time,

33:37.280 --> 33:43.280
through that peripheral attending, is one of among the bodies.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.280
But it's one of among the bodies.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.280
It doesn't require you.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.280
It doesn't require mine.

33:49.280 --> 33:55.280
It doesn't require me doing it.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.280
Because you're balancing the thing.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.280
Well, it totally did that.

34:00.280 --> 34:07.280
So you just start recognizing it without taking it up fully.

34:07.280 --> 34:10.280
And you'll make sure you won't take it up fully,

34:10.280 --> 34:13.280
as long as you remain mindful of the two things.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.280
The anchor.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.280
You remain anchored.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.280
You won't go fully because you're anchored.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.280
You'll come near it.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.280
And you can come nearer and nearer and nearer and nearer.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.280
The stronger your anchor is.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.280
The moment the anchor breaks, you get in there.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.280
And you forgot about your anchor.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.280
What about that?

34:39.280 --> 34:42.280
I don't know.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.280
You can look at awareness.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.280
Like awareness.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.280
That situation.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.280
More situation.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.280
Well, yeah.

34:50.280 --> 34:54.280
You can say, my awareness, that's basically my situation.

34:54.280 --> 34:55.280
Yeah.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.280
Gender awareness without anybody.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.280
That's my situation.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.280
Obviously, just dwelling in my gender awareness.

35:00.280 --> 35:05.280
Well, that becomes something you actually do.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.280
And it becomes a particular thing, which means

35:07.280 --> 35:10.280
that the background of it would be something else.

35:10.280 --> 35:14.280
So now, you want to take up situation in regards to something.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.280
In regard to your body, in regard to your feelings,

35:18.280 --> 35:21.280
in regard to your mind for that matter,

35:21.280 --> 35:23.280
which is almost like situation,

35:23.280 --> 35:28.280
or in regard to the thoughts by the eyes.

35:28.280 --> 35:35.280
Force of the patterns.

35:35.280 --> 35:42.280
So if you become peripherally aware of your body within,

35:42.280 --> 35:48.280
that's about within the situation with your mind.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.280
Then even if you forget about your situation,

35:51.280 --> 35:54.280
the fact that that body is still there,

35:54.280 --> 35:57.280
that can become your anchor.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.280
So you get anchored through the anchor.

36:00.280 --> 36:04.280
And that's how mindfulness progresses.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.280
Or expand.

36:06.280 --> 36:10.280
So you take the thing you have with your body.

36:10.280 --> 36:14.280
Well, then yeah, then that body out there,

36:14.280 --> 36:18.280
then that becomes your situation.

36:18.280 --> 36:21.280
Which means, you don't have to do anything.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.280
For as long as your body is just out there,

36:24.280 --> 36:26.280
your situation is out there, and your mind will,

36:26.280 --> 36:29.280
because it doesn't require any attention.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.280
Because attention means attention,

36:32.280 --> 36:34.280
which means whenever you attend something,

36:34.280 --> 36:36.280
there is peripheral.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.280
There is actually peripheral.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.280
Always, even if you give 100%,

36:42.280 --> 36:46.280
which is actually possible, as you can see,

36:46.280 --> 36:49.280
you can't give 100% of your attention to something,

36:49.280 --> 36:52.280
because that would mean you're fully absorbed in that thing.

36:52.280 --> 36:57.280
But there is always a background to whatever you're fully attending.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.280
And that background is always something

36:59.280 --> 37:02.280
that you peripherally aware of.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.280
That's just how things are ordered,

37:04.280 --> 37:06.280
that's just the nature of the aggregates.

37:06.280 --> 37:10.280
So when you fully develop that knowledge,

37:10.280 --> 37:13.280
it means you can be fully attending whatever you want,

37:13.280 --> 37:15.280
your mindfulness cannot last.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.280
Why? Because there is always peripheral.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.280
And it's fully known.

37:19.280 --> 37:23.280
That's why consciousness is to be understood.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
Because that's the direction of consciousness.

37:25.280 --> 37:32.280
Yeah, that's the situation.

37:32.280 --> 37:36.280
So let's see,

37:36.280 --> 37:39.280
what it's abandoning,

37:39.280 --> 37:42.280
the injustices.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.280
It was in the situation.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.280
By attending properly,

37:46.280 --> 37:50.280
which is the only somewhere that's properly attention,

37:50.280 --> 37:53.280
being aware of knowledge of birth.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.280
It means that no matter how raging your body is

37:56.280 --> 38:00.280
in terms of anger or lust or whatever else,

38:00.280 --> 38:04.280
well, now you learn how to see it indirectly.

38:04.280 --> 38:11.280
Basically seeing it indirectly means seeing it as not mind.

38:11.280 --> 38:14.280
Yeah, it was a cold cut, kind of.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.280
And you can choose to go into it.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
Exactly.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.280
You know you can.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.280
Unless when you become an anagami,

38:21.280 --> 38:23.280
and then an anagami,

38:23.280 --> 38:26.280
whereby even the choice of going back into it is fully understood,

38:26.280 --> 38:29.280
that's even going back into it becomes inconceivable.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.280
Of the choices.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.280
Yeah, you can essentially have it in anger.

38:32.280 --> 38:35.280
But they still have the subtle craving for presence,

38:35.280 --> 38:37.280
craving for unpleasantness,

38:37.280 --> 38:38.280
for absence.

38:38.280 --> 38:44.280
Not pleasant.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.280
Is it the self is on the general level?

38:47.280 --> 38:52.280
Well, self is usually where you don't look.

38:52.280 --> 38:57.280
But yeah, self never appears as an object that you can look at.

38:57.280 --> 39:03.280
However, if you learn how to see things peripherally,

39:03.280 --> 39:08.280
then that general sense of self is seen peripherally as such.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.280
And as I said, it's within the situation.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.280
Everything is within the situation.

39:14.280 --> 39:17.280
Eventually it appears in some way.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.280
Well, it always appears in that negative manner.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.280
But the whole peripheral, the whole prospect of the peripheral

39:23.280 --> 39:28.280
is a negative in regard to what you are used to looking in front of you.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.280
Which is positive.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.280
But there is always a degree of negative in regard to everything.

39:32.280 --> 39:40.280
Which is why there is always a degree of self for a position in regard to everything.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.280
But once you start abandoning actual and peripheral,

39:43.280 --> 39:49.280
as mine, then that which was used to be yourself,

39:49.280 --> 39:51.280
well, those things still keep manifesting.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.280
But now they are not mine.

39:53.280 --> 39:58.280
Thus there is no more self with mine.

40:07.280 --> 40:11.280
You're not trying to find a self with me.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.280
Well, yeah, you can't find it.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.280
You can discern the phenomenon that's mine.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.280
That's me.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.280
That's iron.

40:20.280 --> 40:25.280
Within the general situation.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.280
But that's for another hand.

40:27.280 --> 40:32.280
That just becomes a shape of individual that he is.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.280
Phenological shape.

40:34.280 --> 40:41.280
That used to be me, mine, and I was just this individual.

40:41.280 --> 40:46.280
Yes, things keep going.

40:54.280 --> 40:59.280
But things are establishments of mine,

40:59.280 --> 41:03.280
then or something developed

41:03.280 --> 41:07.280
or you can't do it,

41:07.280 --> 41:10.280
while being mindful of the situation,

41:10.280 --> 41:13.280
while having that proper attention of peripheral.

41:13.280 --> 41:16.280
Yes, that's the direction for any establishments of mine.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.280
You know, so it was whether genres or anything,

41:18.280 --> 41:19.280
the scene of practice,

41:19.280 --> 41:23.280
it's that through that development and that peripheral.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.280
Because once you got that established,

41:25.280 --> 41:27.280
then you can establish other things,

41:27.280 --> 41:31.280
other particular things like compassion or whatever,

41:31.280 --> 41:33.280
kindness.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.280
I see what you mean, yes,

41:35.280 --> 41:39.280
you can be dwelling in it more particularly.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.280
You can take it, particularly.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.280
Yes, literally, yeah.

41:44.280 --> 41:48.280
To help undo things more faster.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.280
Because when you are established in the general situation,

41:51.280 --> 41:56.280
you realize, okay, now and beyond,

41:56.280 --> 42:00.280
griefs and joys in regard to the world.

42:00.280 --> 42:08.280
When you are in the state of that beyond,

42:08.280 --> 42:10.280
then well, now I might as well,

42:10.280 --> 42:12.280
since you can't make that body,

42:12.280 --> 42:14.280
which is not mine, which is already there,

42:14.280 --> 42:17.280
on its own, think things that are good for it,

42:17.280 --> 42:20.280
such as compassion and everything else.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.280
So then when I'm not mindful,

42:22.280 --> 42:24.280
or if I fall back,

42:24.280 --> 42:30.280
perhaps forget to get careless, fall back into the more wholesome environment

42:30.280 --> 42:33.280
that I might poke it again as mine.

42:33.280 --> 42:36.280
And then you keep doing it until eventually,

42:36.280 --> 42:40.280
for an hour out, you can't even fall back anymore.

42:40.280 --> 42:44.280
It's fully developed.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.280
Which is how you can operate and exist,

42:46.280 --> 42:49.280
like every other living being.

42:49.280 --> 42:53.280
And you can't tell the difference externally.

42:53.280 --> 43:00.280
Including the Buddha.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.280
Like this.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.280
Did he?

43:03.280 --> 43:04.280
Something.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.280
Something that people didn't recognize.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.280
Something that people,

43:08.280 --> 43:10.280
they were his followers, like that monk,

43:10.280 --> 43:12.280
who never met him.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.280
He said, teaching.

43:13.280 --> 43:14.280
Yeah, in the book.

43:14.280 --> 43:16.280
I mean, they spent that teaching.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.280
How could he?

43:18.280 --> 43:20.280
How could anybody,

43:20.280 --> 43:21.280
show us a Buddha,

43:21.280 --> 43:23.280
or another, at least,

43:23.280 --> 43:25.280
with great powers that I can recognize?

43:25.280 --> 43:26.280
You can't.

43:26.280 --> 43:29.280
Because it's nothing to do with external, anyway.

43:29.280 --> 43:32.280
Or very little.

43:32.280 --> 43:36.280
I saw this whole story about the description of

43:36.280 --> 43:38.280
how the Buddha's body was.

43:38.280 --> 43:39.280
Oh, yes, about thirty.

43:39.280 --> 43:42.280
Thirty-two or thirty-six months ago, remember?

43:42.280 --> 43:44.280
Yeah, but it's hard to decipher that,

43:44.280 --> 43:48.280
because he was looking at every Indian religion.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.280
They have these.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.280
They have the birth story.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:52.280 --> 43:53.280
All sorts.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.280
But it's irrelevant.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.280
Yeah.

43:55.280 --> 43:57.280
He liked it to do with anything.

43:57.280 --> 44:01.280
Of significance.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.280
Or the first person the Buddha met upon,

44:03.280 --> 44:04.280
he's enlightened.

44:04.280 --> 44:05.280
And he saw,

44:05.280 --> 44:07.280
oh, wow, this monk, he's quite brave.

44:07.280 --> 44:09.280
His senses are clear.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.280
Confidently walking.

44:11.280 --> 44:12.280
He looks like he might be enlightened.

44:12.280 --> 44:14.280
So he kind of suspected.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.280
He's just got a confident look.

44:16.280 --> 44:19.280
The Buddha was emitting like a green line.

44:19.280 --> 44:20.280
So he asked him,

44:20.280 --> 44:23.280
oh, who's the instruction did you follow?

44:23.280 --> 44:24.280
He said, no one.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.280
I like it myself.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.280
I'm fully enlightened by myself.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.280
Nobody's my teacher.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.280
I'm down the Supreme Leader.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.280
And what is my say?

44:32.280 --> 44:33.280
Yeah, right.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.280
It's so big.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.280
Like, laughter.

44:35.280 --> 44:37.280
He may walk off.

44:37.280 --> 44:41.280
It could be true, John.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.280
And that's where the Buddha really is.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.280
No.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.280
If he approaches this.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.280
Because he could have said,

44:47.280 --> 44:49.280
yeah, I'm the greatest man in the world.

44:49.280 --> 44:50.280
Because it will be factual.

44:50.280 --> 44:54.280
He's the greatest in like every realm.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.280
Not just this world.

44:56.280 --> 44:58.280
This is the extent of being the Buddha.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.280
So there was that.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.280
He could have said that.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.280
He wouldn't be alive.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.280
He wouldn't be conceded.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.280
He wouldn't be nothing like that.

45:04.280 --> 45:08.280
But because everybody else is clouded by their conceit.

45:08.280 --> 45:12.280
They could have not possibly seen it as anything other than conceded.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.280
Which is exactly what it's meant.

45:14.280 --> 45:15.280
Oh, really?

45:15.280 --> 45:17.280
I was so big, my friend.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.280
And walked off.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.280
So then the Buddha reaffirmed.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.280
He said, well, maybe if I approach it something

45:23.280 --> 45:25.280
that they can all relate to.

45:25.280 --> 45:26.280
Which is suffering.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.280
Have freedom.

45:27.280 --> 45:37.280
Because when he went there for disciples, when they asked him,

45:37.280 --> 45:47.280
again, they saw,

45:47.280 --> 45:49.280
he looks like he might be alive.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.280
He was very confident in the way he moves and so on.

45:52.280 --> 45:54.280
So they,

45:54.280 --> 45:57.280
all who is instruction that you follow.

45:57.280 --> 45:59.280
But he just said, well, there is suffering.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.280
Who is suffering?

46:00.280 --> 46:01.280
No, there is suffering.

46:01.280 --> 46:02.280
He just refused.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.280
I don't know.

46:03.280 --> 46:04.280
Just let someone talk for months.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.280
Stop asking those questions.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.280
Have you ever heard me speak?

46:07.280 --> 46:08.280
There's nobody else.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.280
Well, then be quiet.

46:09.280 --> 46:24.280
Thank you.
