1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,240
So I was wondering about unhulsing and hulsing because you say that our faults are caused

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:34,480
by acting unhulsing. So to overcome one's faults and let unhulsing behaviour which

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:47,080
becomes self-transparent or authentic in regards to one's intentions, this is not so easy

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:57,160
to do. The transparency, to be constantly watchful of your intentions while you go about

5
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:06,520
your daily life is quite difficult. Sure, but is this the correct way?

6
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:19,160
Well, the first point I would address would be, you mentioned it, the things of faults

7
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:28,360
or things can be regarded as a fault if it's rooted in greed, aversion or delusion. So that

8
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,600
basically a definition of a fault. So even if something is universally accepted, socially

9
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,880
accepted to be done and normal, if it's rooted in greed, aversion, delusion, from the

10
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,400
point of view of development in your mind, that is unhulsing. So that's where this self-transparency

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,680
in regard to the motives behind you wanting to do things. That's why that self-transparency

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:02,680
is necessary. It's necessary as a basis and then actually it is necessary or rather you

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,200
don't have to look for anything other than that basis to develop your mind. In other words,

14
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,520
the criteria that you will be using to develop the self-transparency is the criteria you

15
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,000
can use all the way to complete development of your mind, that transparency. So it is definitely

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,720
something to be done starting from your bodily actions that you start developing

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,160
whatfulness and mindfulness in regard to things you want to do in your body and see where

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,800
is that action rooted or where would it be rooted. Why do I want to do this? So initially

19
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,480
you might have to kind of do it excessively in terms of interrogating yourself, but once

20
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,440
that attitude becomes established, you don't have to think about the questions. Why am I doing

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:02,280
this? Just looking at it would be already a form of investigating the motivation, which

22
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,160
means just by looking at it you would be seeing where it is rooted at. So if you want to

23
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,600
do something with your body in terms of I want to go somewhere or I want to eat something

24
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:21,200
or I want to be working or whatever, you have to ask yourself why. Why do I want to do

25
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,600
this? Then you might say, well, because other people need my help. I was like, okay, so

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,800
then go further. So why are you the one in the position of giving your help to others?

27
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,840
And so on. Doesn't mean like you have to classify this, oh, this is good or this is bad.

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,960
All you want to do is just be fully transparent when it comes down to knowing why you are doing

29
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:49,520
whatever you're doing. Because that's how you will start to sieve out many, many unwholesome

30
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,280
things. The people end up doing habitually because they never look at the reasons why

31
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,360
they're doing them. So they just go with it. And then that ends up proliferating and

32
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,040
getting worse and worse. And then people acquire all sorts of habits and unwholesome things,

33
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,880
sensuality and ill will just because they never really looked at it, never saw themselves

34
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:24,160
doing it. You can put it that way. So going to watch a movie. Okay, yeah, that's a kind

35
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,800
of, it's a neutral example. There's nothing in, nothing moral about watching a movie. There

36
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,720
is nothing even ethically wrong to go and watch a movie. But if you had somebody who wants

37
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,200
to develop their mind in terms of complete freedom from suffering or things of the

38
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,440
pretend to the down of practice, then yeah, like you can say, oh, everybody watches the

39
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,560
movie. It's fine. And then pretend that that's it. That's all to it. And then go and watch

40
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,280
a movie. Oh, you can ask, well, everybody's not me and everybody's not practicing for

41
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,080
me. So why am I going to do it? Why? Why do I want to do it? And if you discovered that

42
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,440
motive behind you is just a distraction, because it feels a bit too heavy being alone

43
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,520
or something, and then you want to go out and watch a movie. And it is, well, as I said,

44
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,880
it's nothing immoral. But from the ultimate point of view of freedom of the mind, freedom

45
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,680
of the mind from the senses, that is, that is an obstacle because you are giving into

46
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,920
the distraction. You want to distract yourself. You want to, you want to engage in an attitude

47
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,360
of delusion, of non-transparency, because it's, it's a bit too boring to just be all the

48
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,640
car mindful or something like that. And then you give into it. But if your focus, so like,

49
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,160
you know, somebody might hear this and say, okay, so I'll never watch a movie again. No,

50
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,760
that's not a point. The point is you should never forget about the reasons why you do things.

51
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,520
And that principle, that attitude, will straighten things out in itself. Because if you're never

52
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,480
transparent, sorry, if you're always transparent, means you can't delude yourself anymore,

53
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,560
which means sooner or later you start feeling guilty for constantly distracting yourself.

54
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,600
And if you don't compromise the attitude of transparency, then that guilt will be enough

55
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,880
to keep you away from things effortlessly. So yes, initially you might need to restrain

56
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,760
yourself and say no to things, but that in itself won't lead to any understanding of the nature

57
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:52,760
of things. You develop in self-transparency in regard to it, that might.
