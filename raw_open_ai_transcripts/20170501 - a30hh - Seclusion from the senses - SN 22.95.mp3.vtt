WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:43.820
Yeah, I thought I'll ask her some questions about John again, because we're just

00:43.820 --> 00:52.420
speaking about it, in particular with this, the word Parimukan, and watching your mouth,

00:52.420 --> 00:54.520
which my mother used to tell me.

00:54.520 --> 01:14.280
Yes, I secluded from essential pleasures, secluded from unholy some states, he bides in the

01:14.280 --> 01:24.320
first genre, which is accompanied by thinking and pondering. So, if one does not

01:24.320 --> 01:35.760
appropriate one's mouth, that area, that's what you were saying the other day.

01:35.760 --> 01:44.840
Why is that? How is that getting you to join us? How does that help? Well, I think we discussed

01:44.840 --> 01:56.480
a few days ago as well. He was basically the presence of the mouth, as an organ, you

01:56.480 --> 02:01.960
can say, but basically the presence of a mouth is a phenomenon in your experience, in your

02:01.960 --> 02:06.880
general experience or daily experience, the presence of that mouth basically, it's an entry

02:06.880 --> 02:15.840
point for the mind towards the body. It's a point of convergence, so to speak. So, in

02:15.840 --> 02:20.160
your experience as a whole, the experience that has this physical body present and all the

02:20.160 --> 02:25.720
possibility of the physical action, verbal action, mental action, the domain of the body

02:25.720 --> 02:32.240
and the domain of the mind, the entry point, so to speak, I mean, the mind doesn't really

02:32.240 --> 02:37.800
enter the body, but in terms of the relationship and the mind is directed towards the body, it's

02:37.800 --> 02:48.400
the phenomenon of the mouth, that's that first point. So, if you have taken up your mouth,

02:48.400 --> 02:54.680
so to speak, if you assumed it to be yours, which implies all the possibilities based

02:54.680 --> 02:59.920
on that mouth, eye, speech, and anything that can be said or any form of manipulation

02:59.920 --> 03:04.760
that can come out of that, if you have taken up the mouth, means you've taken up the

03:04.760 --> 03:15.400
whole domain of the body. I suppose you can say the door, I just, you obviously

03:15.400 --> 03:20.800
need to be qualified because it's not that you actually enter through that door, but

03:20.800 --> 03:25.200
yes, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the first point of reference. So,

03:25.200 --> 03:32.520
to speak, between the relationship, in the relationship between the mind and the body.

03:32.520 --> 03:44.560
So, if you establish mindfulness in regard to the phenomenon of the mouth, in your experience,

03:44.560 --> 03:52.120
basically, you're then guarded by that or you're protected by anything that can come from

03:52.120 --> 03:56.480
the lower point, which is anything that's based on the bodily domain, because the mind

03:56.480 --> 04:00.840
hasn't appropriated the point of convergence, means anything else that converges, it won't

04:00.840 --> 04:08.880
affect you. So, it's basically, yeah, like, like, finding, finding a gateway and then

04:08.880 --> 04:15.080
guarding that, and the gateway towards the domain of the body is the phenomenon of the

04:15.080 --> 04:25.000
mouth, verbal, verbal involvement, nonverbal involvement, possibility of verbal involvement.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.280
All of them are basically, by giving into them or by appropriating them, you are kind

04:31.280 --> 04:36.000
of your mind is sort of descending towards the body, towards the body, actions towards

04:36.000 --> 04:42.960
anything that can pertain to the body. So, if the mind is established in regard to the

04:42.960 --> 04:48.920
phenomenon of the mouth, say in the first jhana, then basically, you are secluded from

04:48.920 --> 04:58.040
anything bodily, in a sense of anything that can arise on account of the five senses.

04:58.040 --> 05:07.400
So, in what way do you, God, how do you, how do you be mindful of the mouth?

05:07.400 --> 05:13.360
Well, exactly, you need to recognize it as a phenomenon. There is no more straightforward

05:13.360 --> 05:22.800
way of describing it, because it's a, it's a peripheral negative, because the presence

05:22.800 --> 05:29.720
of the mouth is negative in regard to the act of speech, or any bodily act, or act of

05:29.720 --> 05:39.080
consumption. So, you need to see this such. So, you don't actually have to go speaking

05:39.080 --> 05:46.440
in order to discern the verbal domain on the contrary. You actually don't speak in order

05:46.440 --> 05:52.560
for that negative to be discerned, negative of the mouth, which is basically, you can,

05:52.560 --> 05:56.400
just a different way of say, the possibility of speech, the possibility of involvement,

05:56.400 --> 06:03.880
the possibility of verbal action, or then come from that. But, it's all rooted down in

06:03.880 --> 06:11.680
a physical fact that you have mouth present right there in your face, that can be used

06:11.680 --> 06:19.600
and, like, see, I mean, I'm uttering words. I'm saying things. I'm designating terms.

06:19.600 --> 06:27.960
But that's all material, so to speak, my mouth. The sounds you hear as well, as as vibrations,

06:27.960 --> 06:32.480
frequencies, whatever they could respond to your ear. It's all on the level of body and

06:32.480 --> 06:40.480
matter. Yet, it's basically, I'm kind of painting up my thoughts to you. I'm designating

06:40.480 --> 06:47.320
them. So, you just naturally, by not being mindful in regard to that, you naturally assume

06:47.320 --> 06:55.720
that your thoughts just kind of flow into these words. But there is no clear point. Well,

06:55.720 --> 07:02.040
there is no point at all when your thought suddenly changes into the word. So, that which

07:02.040 --> 07:07.320
was a thought enters the domain of the speech. No. There isn't. There isn't a single thread

07:07.320 --> 07:12.360
that connects them. You have a domain of thoughts, then you have the domain of speech. You have

07:12.360 --> 07:18.840
the domain of the body. And they are completely independent of each other and they can't mix.

07:18.840 --> 07:33.920
They can't connect. They can't interfere. So, how do you speak then? If there is nothing

07:33.920 --> 07:39.480
that comes from your thoughts, you speak by having thoughts. And then, by breaking into

07:39.480 --> 07:46.160
the sound, speech. But that's it. There is no smooth transition.

07:46.160 --> 07:53.000
Presence of thoughts has the possibility of it being simultaneously replicated, so to

07:53.000 --> 08:11.080
speak in the domain of speech, hence the verbal action, the power of speech. So, how to

08:11.080 --> 08:16.800
purify your speech until, you know, keep the wholesome speech? Well, if you're obviously,

08:16.800 --> 08:21.440
if you're mindful first, if you're mindful of unwholesome speech, so you don't do it,

08:21.440 --> 08:31.760
you're restrained. Even if you don't necessarily see the purpose, you're restrained from the unwholesome,

08:31.760 --> 08:39.880
unwholesome, saying unwholesome things, gossip, slander, malicious speech, greedy speech,

08:39.880 --> 08:50.440
anything like that. You abstain from that. And then by not cultivating these, by not maintaining

08:50.440 --> 08:56.040
these unwholesome habits, habits that are rooted in greedy version delusion. So, basically,

08:56.040 --> 09:01.200
by having your speech restrained, then you can start to discern the negative, that negative

09:01.200 --> 09:05.840
in regard to the act of speech. And the negative is just the presence of the mouth.

09:05.840 --> 09:13.320
That's what, to me it just seems important to you. If you said not to appropriate the mouth,

09:13.320 --> 09:21.000
because once you don't appropriate the mouth, whoops, that's the only way. Then, well, it kind

09:21.000 --> 09:26.200
of solves a lot of the issues. You can, you can see, you can look at it basically,

09:26.200 --> 09:30.640
like, if you see this physical mouth that's kind of moving with the tongue and teeth and so on,

09:30.640 --> 09:36.840
if you see that, as that matter, because of which you're able to speak, the thoughts are

09:36.840 --> 09:43.320
able to be replicated in the main of speech. Because of that physical mouth, but in many

09:43.320 --> 09:48.160
mind, full of the physical mouth, you won't be able to appropriate, you won't be confusing

09:48.160 --> 09:54.200
the two. Because why? You see, it's necessary cause, necessary determination, which is presence

09:54.200 --> 09:59.640
of the physical mouth. As negative as that mouth is, in your experience, when you're engaged

09:59.640 --> 10:04.080
in speech, it's still a real thing. And it is a physical mouth, presence of the physical

10:04.080 --> 10:17.440
mouth without it, it would just be simply inconceivable to speak. And obviously, you don't know

10:17.440 --> 10:26.160
how to speak immediately. And that just shows you the inherent separation between these

10:26.160 --> 10:35.120
domains, the verbal domain, and the mental domain. The baby can't speak, takes quite some time.

10:35.120 --> 10:40.080
You start making sound, then you start hearing the sounds that you yourself are making.

10:40.080 --> 10:45.760
They don't really hear the sounds that others are making. And then basically you start fabricating

10:45.760 --> 10:53.400
the connections between the thoughts, words, and verbal expressions. And then obviously,

10:53.400 --> 10:59.280
the whole assumption grows in regard to it, but you just start assuming the same. I speak

10:59.280 --> 11:11.640
what I think, what I think is what I speak. So it needs to be, it needs to happen. You

11:11.640 --> 11:24.840
need to have that proliferation in order to be able to discern it and then not appropriate.

11:24.840 --> 11:31.000
But in terms of the meditation, yeah, you can just be mindful of the presence of the mouth.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.360
Nothing in particular, don't observe your tongue, or whatever, roof, top of your mouth,

11:35.360 --> 11:40.560
or something like that, it's ridiculous. Just the fact that you have mouth present. So

11:40.560 --> 11:48.760
you can basically be mindful of the front of your face, so to speak, or the whole head

11:48.760 --> 11:56.080
if you want, but basically the front, usually. So if you're mindful of your mouth, and

11:56.080 --> 12:03.440
when that mouth speaks, when that mouth is making sounds, or the possibility that mouth

12:03.440 --> 12:13.520
might be making sounds, well, you start putting, putting like a, like a, like a buffer between

12:13.520 --> 12:22.080
you speaking. Because you might want to speak, but it's your mouth that speaks. You can't

12:22.080 --> 12:30.400
possibly speak. If you could speak, you wouldn't need mouth to speak. But the speech is inseparable

12:30.400 --> 12:35.200
from the mouth. It's difficult when you, when you're not speaking. And you're, you're mindful

12:35.200 --> 12:40.520
of the mouth. It's kind of easier. But when you start speaking, it's, you made it lose

12:40.520 --> 12:44.960
the mindfulness. And that's the whole point. You train that mindfulness, or rather you refine

12:44.960 --> 12:50.920
it to the point that it ascends in the general background to such a level whereby even

12:50.920 --> 12:58.840
when you speak, that mindfulness doesn't get disturbed. And by not having that mindfulness

12:58.840 --> 13:22.840
disturbed, they won't be any room for introducing the assumption of I am speaking. And

13:22.840 --> 13:29.960
the mouth as a, as a, as a, as a physical organ has lots of other, obviously, significance.

13:29.960 --> 13:37.320
As we spoke before, you know, it is a point of, of consumption. You consume things because

13:37.320 --> 13:43.920
the self, it's most closely and probably, like, we're probably right off the bat, as

13:43.920 --> 13:48.920
you consume it, you're born, the baby starts and then find its ends of self, underlying

13:48.920 --> 13:53.560
tendencies towards the self with the mouth. That's what you're putting things in your mouth,

13:53.560 --> 13:57.640
everything, like objects, anything, because that is a way of assimilating them, of appropriating

13:57.640 --> 14:03.240
them, of consuming them, or just of, of, of getting to know them.

14:03.240 --> 14:13.720
It's true. Get it. It feels like you are touching it with your sense of self. Then obviously

14:13.720 --> 14:21.400
that kind of grows further, and then you have various expressions that they develop on

14:21.400 --> 14:26.320
top of that. So then the speech and all that. But basically, always, the food will always

14:26.320 --> 14:34.120
remain connected to the mouth, and activating. And even, even centrality in general, it's,

14:34.120 --> 14:44.240
the mouth plays quite a big significance. Because it is a, it is a, it is a, it is almost

14:44.240 --> 14:49.720
like a symbol of assimilation, or out of stance for the, the assumption of, of, of assimilation

14:49.720 --> 14:55.360
and consumption, or simply said appropriation. Because when you eat the food, the food

14:55.360 --> 15:01.200
doesn't change in the sense of, it doesn't really become, it doesn't disappear from

15:01.200 --> 15:06.380
the world, so to speak. It remains external. The food that was on the table, it's now

15:06.380 --> 15:11.840
mashed up in a stomach. But that stomach and the table, they're all part of the external

15:11.840 --> 15:17.240
world. Which means, consuming the food is just having a revolve around these external

15:17.240 --> 15:23.760
things. It doesn't actually get inside, in me. I don't consume it, because I am not in

15:23.760 --> 15:28.720
the stomach. The stomach, stomach is external, same with mouth is external, same as the

15:28.720 --> 15:33.960
table is external, to the, to the sense of self. By the sense of self assumes your

15:33.960 --> 15:38.640
ownership, so it just feels as if it is on the other side, on the inside of the self,

15:38.640 --> 15:43.680
so to speak. And that's why the food is always that, that kind of subtle, subtle maintenance

15:43.680 --> 15:51.080
of that, of that assumption. By eating unmindfully, you are basically maintaining the assumption

15:51.080 --> 15:55.920
of the self is consuming the food that's now disappearing behind it. It's being taken.

15:55.920 --> 16:03.120
But it doesn't, it stays in that external world. It just goes through the mouth, contacts

16:03.120 --> 16:08.720
you with a, with a, with a, with a taste. And then stays there basically, stays in the

16:08.720 --> 16:14.320
external world. That's the thing, you can be moderate in eating. Oh, you know, you can

16:14.320 --> 16:18.680
choose, I'll have a little bit of this, a little bit of that. But if you, but completely,

16:18.680 --> 16:23.360
it's a complete blur. Of course. Or I will, I'll have this. And then I'll wriggle

16:23.360 --> 16:28.160
out, and then I'll bow, and then I'll eat my, to carry now, and then I'll bow, wriggle

16:28.160 --> 16:33.560
out, just, you know, pets. But that, I mean, that's just like a random observance, basically.

16:33.560 --> 16:38.400
Yeah. That means nothing. Yeah. Of course, you know, if you're, if you're picking out and

16:38.400 --> 16:44.000
eating calisely, well, this is not the only way, but then either way, like you can abstain

16:44.000 --> 16:47.640
from food entirely and still not develop any wisdom when you got there. There's the,

16:47.640 --> 16:53.600
the only way, which is supposed to eat the Buddhist Jesus mindfully. Yeah. And, well,

16:53.600 --> 17:00.160
how else than other to watch? And mindfulness, basically already implies a, a degree of

17:00.160 --> 17:03.920
discernment and knowledge. So it's not, mindfulness is nothing to do with little ritual you

17:03.920 --> 17:09.200
might observe before you're meal and during your meal. Be present with the taste. Be present

17:09.200 --> 17:13.280
with the taste. Well, I mean, if you want to do that, sure, but that might not necessarily

17:13.280 --> 17:18.520
lead you to anything, because the taste is present one way or the other. You can't, and

17:18.520 --> 17:21.800
that's, that's the point that you need to recognize, which you don't. Oh, I must be present

17:21.800 --> 17:26.800
with this taste whereby you imply that if you're not present with a taste, what, the taste

17:26.800 --> 17:31.640
is gone or the taste has in the reason of the taste. No, the taste is there, which means

17:31.640 --> 17:35.760
you have no choice but to be present with the taste. So I'm making the extra effort in

17:35.760 --> 17:40.640
top weight of being present with the taste when you are present with the taste. And that

17:40.640 --> 17:47.440
is, that is the, again, the taste or other distances in themselves are also in themselves

17:47.440 --> 17:53.520
a, a point. Well, it's basically a point where, where, where people, where people get deceived.

17:53.520 --> 17:59.600
As I said, you, like in this particular example, when, when, when a person thinks, or other

17:59.600 --> 18:03.920
person assumes, like eating the food and the disappearance of the food through the mouth

18:03.920 --> 18:10.600
and chewing, stands for the assimilation of that food, stands for consumption, disappears

18:10.600 --> 18:18.200
the self-tuket. But basically, that food has just moved from one external point to another

18:18.200 --> 18:23.360
external point, from the table into the stomach down the toilet drain and so on, part of it

18:23.360 --> 18:28.200
is staying in the body. But even that body, that table, that stomach, all of that remains

18:28.200 --> 18:35.480
external. So there is absolutely no point from that external, from which this food can

18:35.480 --> 18:41.640
arise and get close to the sense of self. What does get close to the sense of self is

18:41.640 --> 18:49.960
the taste, contacted by taste. And that's the thing. That's why that confusion sets. Same

18:49.960 --> 18:57.720
goes with the sight, with the ear. Because your eyes are objects in the world. Objects

18:57.720 --> 19:04.160
you see in the world are objects in the world. But the vision in itself, it's not quite

19:04.160 --> 19:11.480
isn't it? You see the world, but the vision in itself, that which you can't see, where

19:11.480 --> 19:17.280
is that then? So you just assume that to be where yourself is, so to speak, because

19:17.280 --> 19:23.200
it's not here nor there. And by taking that up, then you create this division between

19:23.200 --> 19:30.320
external, the sense of objects and internal, me. Well, basically, you appropriate the

19:30.320 --> 19:34.720
sense places. You appropriate, you end up appropriating your body by not having your mind

19:34.720 --> 19:42.400
developed in regard to the contact, contact by eyes, contact by sight, contact by taste,

19:42.400 --> 19:54.120
contact by sound vision, or vision, yeah. But if you were to see that, be the external

19:54.120 --> 20:03.480
object, be it an internal sense space, such as your tongue, or your eye, eye organ, wood,

20:03.480 --> 20:07.240
like okay, let's go back to the taste. So if there's no, if there's no tongue, if there's

20:07.240 --> 20:18.240
no mouth, and if there is nothing to be consumed, eat it, put it in the mouth, wood, a taste

20:18.240 --> 20:26.240
be possible to arise. It's inconceivable. You have to, not just that it wouldn't be impossible

20:26.240 --> 20:33.760
to arise, it would be also impossible to remain standing if these things disappear. You

20:33.760 --> 20:40.080
might have an arisen taste, but suddenly, well, suddenly you lose your sense of taste,

20:40.080 --> 20:45.320
you lose your tongue, you lose your head. Can this taste remain? It can't. Which means

20:45.320 --> 20:52.320
no matter how closely, taste, or vision, or sounds pressure you, they also remain external,

20:52.320 --> 20:56.720
because they are rooted in external, and they can break away from it, it's inconceivable.

20:56.720 --> 21:02.840
But once you see that the internal sense space as external, as external, as external, as

21:02.840 --> 21:13.040
external objects, as even more external. Yeah. Because if you see the, the, the internal

21:13.040 --> 21:28.560
sense as external, in the body, belonging to the body, over there, then that middle part

21:28.560 --> 21:39.160
of the vision, that sounds, it's, where, where, you say where is it, but I think it's

21:39.160 --> 21:43.280
so in between. It is in between, and it stays in between. Yeah. It's just when you're

21:43.280 --> 21:49.160
appropriate in between, then, well, then you, you, you, you make it liable to, to, to

21:49.160 --> 21:56.240
being underlined, underlined, by the, by the tendency of the eye, the tendencies of the

21:56.240 --> 22:01.240
nose, but as the tendency of the tongue, one said, eye is not appropriated. If you don't

22:01.240 --> 22:06.200
appropriate eye, if you're mindful of it, properly, say, if your mindfulness is properly

22:06.200 --> 22:10.480
established in regard to the, the eye organs, the present in the world, is that because

22:10.480 --> 22:14.720
of which the sight is there in the first place? Yeah. If that's established, then exactly

22:14.720 --> 22:19.760
there is nothing underlining, underlying that whole picture. Because everything is now

22:19.760 --> 22:25.720
pushed externally. I, everything is now not taken to be mine, not taken to be pertaining

22:25.720 --> 22:31.240
to me. So there is nothing underlying it. There's nothing underneath. But you have to be

22:31.240 --> 22:36.360
prepared. If you otherwise assume, you always assume. Like when you're eating, basically,

22:36.360 --> 22:43.120
your, your, your, your tongue, your sense of taste, your sense of taste, that is assumed

22:43.120 --> 22:48.640
as underneath. That is assumed as mine. And the consumption of the food, the disappearance

22:48.640 --> 22:51.760
of the food is disappearing under that.

22:51.760 --> 22:58.880
But it isn't even enough that that's a further investigation, like you think it's

22:58.880 --> 23:10.120
like internal senses, then you're investigating the external form and so on, sense, sense

23:10.120 --> 23:16.960
of, sense objects, and then you're investigating vision and sound and taste. Okay. But do you

23:16.960 --> 23:21.520
have to go there for? No, I wasn't talking about the investigation of it, because I already

23:21.520 --> 23:27.440
implies quite a lot of wrong views. People investigating end up explaining it to

23:27.440 --> 23:30.760
themselves how these things work. That's irrelevant.

23:30.760 --> 23:36.320
I mean, I just, I'm not talking about investigation. I'm talking about the direct discernment of

23:36.320 --> 23:40.800
the, and I think that's what you're aiming at as well. The direct discernment of the

23:40.800 --> 23:45.480
sense base as that which is already in the world. And by being that which is already in

23:45.480 --> 23:50.280
the world, like a sense organ, you can't really control it. You have no say. I mean,

23:50.280 --> 23:55.600
you're, your, your eyes are there working quite an intricate organs with all the nerves

23:55.600 --> 24:02.160
and optic nerves and so on. And you have absolutely, absolutely no access to it. And you have

24:02.160 --> 24:09.960
no say in it. So if that thing fails for whatever random reason, your sight is gone, your

24:09.960 --> 24:14.760
whole world of vision, everything you've ever seen, everything you ever would see, everything

24:14.760 --> 24:19.880
you're seeing right now, everything that you ever felt on account of what you've seen,

24:19.880 --> 24:26.320
everything that you ever done that you would do on account of what you've seen is gone.

24:26.320 --> 24:31.640
Because none of that would be able to remain standing if these fleshy eye organs are not

24:31.640 --> 24:39.200
there. So you recognize, oh, I can't possibly own this even if I were to, you know, to make

24:39.200 --> 24:46.040
the extra effort to do so. You can't. You can say, and if you start seeing that, then

24:46.040 --> 24:50.640
you can even say, oh, these are my eyes, but they won't actually stand for the assumption

24:50.640 --> 24:56.320
of my mind, because it's, it's obvious. It just becomes obvious. It's, well, it's not

24:56.320 --> 25:01.880
the chair to sit and then stop owning it. It means seeing directly, automatically results

25:01.880 --> 25:06.800
in disowning it. And disowning everything else that stands upon it, which is everything

25:06.800 --> 25:11.720
else, basically. Yeah. So that's, that's what I'm talking about, like, I got into a look

25:11.720 --> 25:15.680
at the things that stand upon it. No, of course not. No, no, no, that's a complete mistake.

25:15.680 --> 25:19.640
That's basically the, the, the, the science, the worldly science, or looking at the things

25:19.640 --> 25:24.560
or psychology of explaining things and drawing parallel connections and external, nothing

25:24.560 --> 25:31.640
to do by staying mindful of that sense base. The body, the body, they, properly, that's

25:31.640 --> 25:36.440
enough. Well, it's enough for you because you've heard enough in terms of what you're

25:36.440 --> 25:41.520
supposed to see. But if somebody just comes to it with all the wrong views that they

25:41.520 --> 25:46.240
still have, and then you say them, just be mindful of that, it won't mean anything. And

25:46.240 --> 25:50.440
certainly won't result in anything. So yeah, you can just be mindful of that when you

25:50.440 --> 25:54.680
know how to regard it. So as often they talk in the sutras, so how should I regard the

25:54.680 --> 26:02.360
eye? Well, regard it as not mine, not me, not I am. Then yeah, yeah, be mindful of that

26:02.360 --> 26:08.400
because that attitude is already implied through practice, through training, that attitude,

26:08.400 --> 26:16.440
you basically use the future mindfulness with that attitude. And you can only do so when

26:16.440 --> 26:21.160
you know what the attitude is, that needs to be developed. The attitude of this on it

26:21.160 --> 26:25.840
is a preparation, this passion. Yes, not a thought. No, this is not mine. No, no, no,

26:25.840 --> 26:31.080
that's already two course. That thought, it's already, it's already two, two course. Like

26:31.080 --> 26:36.400
if you're trying to, you know, to pull a, pull a thread through the, through the eye of

26:36.400 --> 26:40.440
the needle, well, if the thread's too big, it's just one foot. So you need to refine it,

26:40.440 --> 26:46.760
refine it until it can go through it. So show you can say attitude is a formal thought,

26:46.760 --> 26:52.600
but it's much subtle way of thought, then, actually, of course, think of it.

26:52.600 --> 27:05.840
Because saying the eye is not yours, it's different. It doesn't mean anything, yeah. So watching

27:05.840 --> 27:17.120
that space, the space as a face, your mouth, that space. Well, that can bring you closer

27:17.120 --> 27:23.800
to, to, to, to seeing your sense objects, sorry, your sense basis, such as eyes, nose,

27:23.800 --> 27:28.800
ears, tongue, well, even face, touch, basically, their head is the foremost, you know, their

27:28.800 --> 27:34.480
head is your identity, the face. So having the mindfulness established to the

27:34.480 --> 27:38.280
four of their face, in regards to their face, yeah, you're having a mindfulness

27:38.280 --> 27:48.360
established in regard to the sense basis, and being, and not, not appropriating, or

27:48.360 --> 28:00.840
sure say being mindful of that sense basis, secludes me from, well secludes you from

28:00.840 --> 28:13.840
anything that is, that those sense basis are subjected to. Anything, yeah. So here,

28:13.840 --> 28:22.240
a large sound, or see something intense sight, but because of my mindfulness to be developed

28:22.240 --> 28:28.080
strong enough, you'd see that that sight or sound pertains to the actual sense organ,

28:28.080 --> 28:32.360
that is out there with that sight and sound, not out of you, because you stopped assuming

28:32.360 --> 28:39.480
that now. But the thing is not, you've stopped assuming the body, you see it where, where

28:39.480 --> 28:48.840
it is out there. So you can't, you can't be inside it, but you are not exactly anyway,

28:48.840 --> 29:00.360
in particular either. Yeah. So those, those visions, those tastes can't go into you. No,

29:00.360 --> 29:09.320
because you is not rooted anymore to that, which goes visions and sounds pertain to. So

29:09.320 --> 29:13.280
through the appropriation of the sense basis, or through being, through not having mindfulness

29:13.280 --> 29:18.040
developed to the extent necessary in regard to the sense basis, that which those sense

29:18.040 --> 29:26.440
basis are subjected to, you are subjected to. These sounds enter you. These, these visions

29:26.440 --> 29:34.840
arise you, even sight you, the taste arises in you. So it's all me in regard to me. But

29:34.840 --> 29:41.520
if you become established in regard to this sense organs, as the organs, as external organs,

29:41.520 --> 29:45.440
which is the only way you can be established in regard to them, that internal dimension,

29:45.440 --> 29:50.320
that internal assumption of them, will fade. Why? Because with that proper mindfulness

29:50.320 --> 29:54.880
established, it becomes apparent that the sight's pertain to the eyes, the sounds pertain

29:54.880 --> 30:00.240
to the ears. So they keep working the way they've always done. Exactly. Yeah. And you

30:00.240 --> 30:04.280
recognize there was never even room for your sense of self, and it was just not knowing

30:04.280 --> 30:09.120
that there was no room, you assumed it there. That's why in the scene, there will only

30:09.120 --> 30:12.160
be the scene, in the hurt, there will only be the hurt. And there will also be an

30:12.160 --> 30:16.160
other scene. It just carries on. Yeah. For scene, there's seen, in hurt, there's hurt,

30:16.160 --> 30:22.160
in taste, there's taste. There's nothing else. Because there's, there's this merely thought

30:22.160 --> 30:27.800
that you won't see anything anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's, that's not, not

30:27.800 --> 30:38.800
the case. Yes. Anything further away from your, from that convergence point, from your

30:38.800 --> 30:45.800
mouth. It's, you know, anything further away, even down your body. It's just, it's just

30:45.800 --> 30:51.360
a step away, even further away. It's exactly the convergence of the mouth, the face. It's,

30:51.360 --> 30:56.920
it's basically the way the body is structured. You know, if your eyes were on top of your

30:56.920 --> 31:01.920
palms or something, you think it wouldn't work the same way, but they're not. All, all

31:01.920 --> 31:09.440
of the, the major sense organs are based in your head. Thus, the head, thus, the face. Yeah.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.640
And that's it. They're all based on the front of your face. And years to decide, but still

31:13.640 --> 31:21.200
close to the front. So then, if, if you're mindful of, of, of that physical presence,

31:21.200 --> 31:28.440
as that, because of which, the vision in itself, the sounds, the, the, the sphere of, of

31:28.440 --> 31:38.160
sounds, the, the, the smells, taste, touches, is there, then basically you cease to be liable

31:38.160 --> 31:47.600
to it. Or rather, you're not being affected by it. But can, can anyone be mindful of that

31:47.600 --> 31:53.840
prop, not, not anyone can just be mindful of that. Well, no, because, uh, mindfulness, it's

31:53.840 --> 32:00.200
not just the pure awareness, which I think such thing doesn't, doesn't exist. It's the

32:00.200 --> 32:05.920
pure awareness. It's not aware of anything. So mindfulness, the right mindfulness, which

32:05.920 --> 32:14.120
basically, inseparable from, uh, discernment, that can then lead to the, the, the proper

32:14.120 --> 32:21.680
knowledge of the nature of things. So you need to, you can't just just be mindful of

32:21.680 --> 32:27.480
your, yeah, because that, yeah, be mindful of my face and then what? No, you need to be mindful

32:27.480 --> 32:31.280
in the right way. So you need to discern it. That's why you can be mindful of your face.

32:31.280 --> 32:38.400
Doesn't mean anything. Uh, but if you're mindful of your face, as that, because of which,

32:38.400 --> 32:43.800
the entire world that's right, simultaneously present there, is standing right there,

32:43.800 --> 32:50.520
then you, you're mindful of, basically, of the relationship between the two, of the determination

32:50.520 --> 32:54.920
and that, which is being determined and that determination, it's, it's, it's basically

32:54.920 --> 33:01.600
that face, the presence of these sense organs, operating sense organs. And see, there is

33:01.600 --> 33:05.280
a whole world that simultaneously stands upon that, including your sense of self, upon

33:05.280 --> 33:13.080
the presence of these sense organs. And you can't even, on the level of your abstraction,

33:13.080 --> 33:21.680
you can't even conceive how it would be if you were, to be in control of these sense organs.

33:21.680 --> 33:27.000
Control the workings, the inner workings of the, of the eye, of the lump of flesh, that

33:27.000 --> 33:32.960
is your eye, inconceivable. You can observe it in the others, but there will never be your

33:32.960 --> 33:38.760
working eye, because that's what you see with your working eye. And then you can infer,

33:38.760 --> 33:47.160
that's my working eye. But if that inference, so to speak, does not stand as the determination

33:47.160 --> 33:51.400
for the world that simultaneously present as you are speaking it, as you are seeing

33:51.400 --> 34:01.640
it, then it will not be seen correctly. That's why it looks the same externally. The description

34:01.640 --> 34:07.200
of the Buddha gave of the senses and the description of the modern medical science tells us. This

34:07.200 --> 34:12.160
describes the eye as a flesh organ, but there is a big difference. The Buddha described

34:12.160 --> 34:15.440
that, and that, he described it as a present phenomenon, because that's the only way

34:15.440 --> 34:20.680
you can describe it. You can't possibly see your eye directly with your eye. You can

34:20.680 --> 34:27.880
infer its presence through other senses, which is the same thing the scientists would do

34:27.880 --> 34:36.920
just in regard to other people senses. But the difference is, for Buddhist practice,

34:36.920 --> 34:46.520
that inference, when you infer your eye as the reason for your sight, you include simultaneously

34:46.520 --> 34:54.120
the present sight in that inference. Which means, the whole thing, the whole inference

34:54.120 --> 34:59.960
happens on the basis of mindfulness. So you start discerning the simultaneous principle

34:59.960 --> 35:03.920
of the determination, and that which is being determined, that simultaneously standing

35:03.920 --> 35:10.560
upon it. Scientists doesn't do that. He can't do that because his assumptions of himself,

35:10.560 --> 35:16.040
of his world are already far out external in the world. So even when he looks at the other

35:16.040 --> 35:21.280
people's eyes, even if he says, my eyes are like the same, that doesn't pertain anywhere

35:21.280 --> 35:26.520
nearly to that, which his eyes actually are in that experience, as that determination

35:26.520 --> 35:45.920
upon which the whole world of his stands. So by, again, being mindful of the sense

35:45.920 --> 35:59.600
of the basis, then seeing them directly in a very mindful mind. Well, as I said, that

35:59.600 --> 36:04.680
is the closest you can see them. That is the director of seeing them as these third-party

36:04.680 --> 36:10.400
objects that are out there in the world. But everybody can do that. But not everybody

36:10.400 --> 36:16.400
can basically see them as simultaneously as the termination of that which you're seeing.

36:16.400 --> 36:27.680
I, them. So you can be thinking about your eyes or think about their just vision as a

36:27.680 --> 36:32.880
domain. And if you see those, all of those thoughts, all the thoughts that have resulted

36:32.880 --> 36:36.880
on account of it, all of the thoughts that will result in the future, on account of

36:36.880 --> 36:44.360
anything seen, that whole sphere, that whole domain, is right there and then simultaneously

36:44.360 --> 36:49.880
determined by the still working presence of the flashy eyes in your head as you are thinking

36:49.880 --> 36:56.800
those very thoughts. And that's what no scientist can do. Because if they were able to do that,

36:56.800 --> 37:02.080
they would basically fall back or rather they would abandon the scientific view, which

37:02.080 --> 37:12.560
is the view of the external realities and so on. And then, if you see that simultaneously,

37:12.560 --> 37:17.640
and if you cultivate that simultaneously principle, then no matter what, what else simultaneously

37:17.640 --> 37:23.200
arises, no matter how inciting, how frightening the sight might be, it won't actually neither

37:23.200 --> 37:28.760
inside you, nor frightening you. Why? Because the mindfulness remains unwavering, properly

37:28.760 --> 37:33.680
established in regard to the presence of the flashy organ dera, the simultaneous calls

37:33.680 --> 37:39.040
determination, reason for the sight in the first place, whatever particularly that sight

37:39.040 --> 38:02.240
might be. No, because what you are not appropriating then is your thought of what you think the

38:02.240 --> 38:11.600
eye is, that's then not being seen as simultaneously determined by the presence of the flashy eye

38:11.600 --> 38:17.080
in your head. But if your mindfulness starts revolving around the presence of the flashy

38:17.080 --> 38:24.720
eye in your head, that means your mindfulness becomes established upon that, which is going

38:24.720 --> 38:29.080
to be there for as long as you live basically, which is another way of just saying developing

38:29.080 --> 38:33.320
mindfulness of the body to the extent necessary for the final knowledge. Whether it's eye,

38:33.320 --> 38:42.080
nose, ear, or basically sense basis, it's the body. Again, you can do that wrongly in

38:42.080 --> 38:45.760
the same sense you just described that you can be wrongly mindful of your eyes. Oh, I'm

38:45.760 --> 38:51.720
mindful of the body, I'm observing the body. But that leaves the observer, or rather the

38:51.720 --> 38:57.200
assumption of the observer out. But if you don't observe the body, if you refine the body

38:57.200 --> 39:02.600
as already there, because of which the entire actions that you're doing right now aimed

39:02.600 --> 39:06.840
at this body, such as mindfulness of the body or whatever else, depend upon the presence

39:06.840 --> 39:11.840
of the body in the first place, then there is no room for that observer to step outside

39:11.840 --> 39:17.520
of it. Everything is included, because everything becomes undermined by your recognition that

39:17.520 --> 39:22.440
it all depends upon the external presence of this physical body, which I have no control

39:22.440 --> 39:37.640
of. You have the rest of the world, the presence of this body, so mindful of that any of the

39:37.640 --> 39:43.760
background that rest of the world. So, you don't want to be doing mindfulness, you want

39:43.760 --> 39:59.040
to develop to the point where mindfulness does you. Where your sense of self becomes secondary

39:59.040 --> 40:28.040
and regard to the mindfulness.

40:28.040 --> 40:47.400
So, there's a clue from unholesome thoughts, there's a clue from central place, and some

40:47.400 --> 41:00.600
clue from unholesome thoughts. It's not a coping of their sense-basis, it's a clue from

41:00.600 --> 41:11.080
the body, mindful of the body, when he is secluded or separated or detached from unholesome thoughts.

41:11.080 --> 41:15.680
Well, not detached, in a sense, but basically they are rising around, wholesome thoughts

41:15.680 --> 41:23.480
cannot be affecting you, cannot be appropriate, because you're mindful of the basis of their

41:23.480 --> 41:35.360
rising. So, if you disown the body, even temporarily, so to speak, nothing that comes on a

41:35.360 --> 41:41.160
kind of body, including thoughts, can't be yours, can't be affecting you, and that's

41:41.160 --> 41:50.160
what's being recognized in the first genre, that pleasure of seclusion, pleasure of confidence,

41:50.160 --> 41:55.240
of, oh, you know, you're safe here, nothing that arises on account of your experience as

41:55.240 --> 42:05.840
a whole can touch you. What is safe? Why does anything need to be safe? You can just

42:05.840 --> 42:13.120
have sense of safety in regard to these things. Well, you can say, I am safe, but they

42:13.120 --> 42:16.760
won't stand for the sense of I am, in terms of appropriating the sense-basis, because

42:16.760 --> 42:22.400
through not appropriating the sense-basis, you become safe. But sure, if you want to designate

42:22.400 --> 42:32.440
it, you have to say it like that, there's not a way. The sense of safety is, like, I go

42:32.440 --> 42:38.480
inside, close the door, I am safe, from those- Yeah, well, you can extrapolate, but the nature

42:38.480 --> 42:43.600
of feeling safe, and just taking to take it up to the ultimate level, where you feel safe

42:43.600 --> 42:50.280
from your own senses. When you feel safe from the sights, you feel safe from thoughts.

42:50.280 --> 42:57.480
There doesn't mean they still, they don't arise. They're very much arise, but they can't

42:57.480 --> 43:07.000
take you with them, wherever they go. So you don't move in regard to the movement of thinking

43:07.000 --> 43:14.600
and pondering, or in regard to the movement that that thinking and pondering is.

43:14.600 --> 43:34.000
So, I can say there is safety from, like, there is seclusion from those senses, from my

43:34.000 --> 43:44.760
own wholesome thoughts, there is safety, there's joy from- Yes, there's the joy from seclusion.

43:44.760 --> 43:53.920
To say it, I am. Well, you can say it like that, but as an experience, you don't feel

43:53.920 --> 44:00.040
that I am happy, I am happy. No, you don't feel that I am. Because you can't, you can't

44:00.040 --> 44:29.320
feel that. Because otherwise, there wouldn't be a jam.

44:29.320 --> 44:38.360
And any quality that comes about, from life, from being in the Jhana and state, developing

44:38.360 --> 44:43.520
mind, any quality that comes about is not appropriate. Exactly, which is why Jhana is wholesome

44:43.520 --> 44:53.280
in itself. Which is why another Jhana is not in oblivious state. His state fully founded

44:53.280 --> 45:01.120
upon am wavering mindfulness. Which is inappropriate. Well, yeah, if the mindfulness is established

45:01.120 --> 45:07.120
as sufficient as extended theory, appropriation becomes impossible. Because appropriation is

45:07.120 --> 45:14.320
the result of mistake, misconception, unmindfulness, non-mindful effigy. Results in assumption,

45:14.320 --> 45:19.640
result in appropriation, results in maintenance of ignorance. Practicing the opposite

45:19.640 --> 45:26.640
and does that. So that you can only, the only person that can be mindful, right, mind,

45:26.640 --> 45:32.640
as a person doesn't, appropriate in the mind. Basically, the person who knows what

45:32.640 --> 45:43.360
mindfulness is, has knowledge of mindfulness. Mindfulness is not just a pure indifferent,

45:43.360 --> 45:55.520
state, technique, method that you engage impossible. Because you can't do, you can't do Jhana

45:55.520 --> 46:01.360
and then get to state where you don't appropriate things anymore. Sorry, I don't follow that.

46:01.360 --> 46:07.360
Like, practice Jhana, practice mindfulness of breathing. To enter the state of non-mindfulness.

46:07.360 --> 46:14.360
No, no, no, no. In order to enter the Jhana, you order the need to disappropriate.

46:14.360 --> 46:22.360
In order to, in order for mind to get settled in Jhana, the mindfulness needs to have been

46:22.360 --> 46:31.360
practiced. Well, quite a lot. And develop such a wide basis of mindfulness whereby it gets

46:31.360 --> 46:36.360
established regardless of what's happening around you. And then on certain occasions,

46:36.360 --> 46:40.360
you can then just dwell on certain aspects of that establishment and enter the Jhana.

46:40.360 --> 46:45.360
And certain aspects of that establishment is the aspect of seclusion, aspect of safety,

46:45.360 --> 46:48.360
aspect of confidence, aspect of thinking and pondering.

46:48.360 --> 46:53.360
And directing the mind to those aspects. Exactly. So someone tells you that those aspects

46:53.360 --> 47:01.360
are found in such a state. Yes, if your basis of mindfulness is developed to such a wide extent,

47:01.360 --> 47:06.360
that already contains all these things and you already see them clearly, then all you need to do is

47:06.360 --> 47:10.360
hear what the first Jhana is and by thinking about it, you enter it.

47:10.360 --> 47:14.360
Which is exactly what happened to Mahamogala. When the Buddha told him,

47:14.360 --> 47:17.360
you should practice the first Jhana instead of your mind in the first Jhana.

47:17.360 --> 47:21.360
And then he thought, okay, so he went to the forest, sat under the tree,

47:21.360 --> 47:25.360
or on the rock, a country member, and said, first Jhana, first Jhana, what is first Jhana?

47:25.360 --> 47:30.360
What did the Lord mean by saying first Jhana? And then he just recollected all the things

47:30.360 --> 47:35.360
that the Buddha said the first Jhana is and recollected them. He entered the first Jhana.

47:35.360 --> 47:41.360
Why? Because his mindfulness was already developed to such an extent that he could discern these things.

47:41.360 --> 47:44.360
Most people can't, because most people mindfulness is not a solution.

47:44.360 --> 47:48.360
And it never will be, as long as the practice of meditation, in other comments,

47:48.360 --> 47:53.360
revolves around methods and techniques of observance that somehow leads you into a state

47:53.360 --> 48:00.360
of most often oblivion.

48:00.360 --> 48:10.360
So, just like, for example, the mindfulness of the body is used to.

48:10.360 --> 48:15.360
And he says, here, a Bikku, going to the forest on the root of a tree,

48:15.360 --> 48:19.360
where empty heart sits down and then fold his legs crosswise,

48:19.360 --> 48:23.360
sets his body erect, and establishes mindfulness in front of him.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.360
Or establishes mindfulness.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.360
Mindfulness.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.360
Party will come.

48:27.360 --> 48:31.360
Around his mouth or around his face.

48:31.360 --> 48:35.360
Because that's what party will come means, literally, around the mouth.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.360
Around the mouth.

48:37.360 --> 48:44.360
So, that's already his established mindfulness.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.360
Correctly.

48:45.360 --> 48:49.360
If you say even if you dispute that, if you say it doesn't mean around the mouth,

48:49.360 --> 48:51.360
means to the front of the face, basically.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.360
It means that.

48:52.360 --> 48:58.360
So, by establishing your mind, your mindfulness in regard to the front of the collection

48:58.360 --> 49:02.360
of your sense of basis in front of yourself.

49:02.360 --> 49:03.360
Pretty much.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.360
Into yourself.

49:05.360 --> 49:11.360
Basically, discerning the reasons that underlie your sense of self,

49:11.360 --> 49:18.360
as an external given things, which means, oh, if I can't own the reasons of my sense of self,

49:18.360 --> 49:23.360
if I can't own and control that, which determines my very sense of self,

49:23.360 --> 49:28.360
which is this sense of self, I can't possibly have this sense of self as mine either.

49:28.360 --> 49:31.360
And that's what Anata is.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.360
It's not self.

49:33.360 --> 49:35.360
It's not no self.

49:35.360 --> 49:39.360
So, that which you're taking to be yourself, is still stands there.

49:39.360 --> 49:43.360
But now, it's seen as something they cannot be yours.

49:43.360 --> 49:45.360
Thus, it's not self anymore.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.360
Not myself.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.360
Impossible to own.

49:49.360 --> 49:53.360
Here in the first section, let's see.

49:53.360 --> 49:55.360
So, he establishes mindfulness.

49:55.360 --> 49:58.360
Mindfulness in front of him.

49:58.360 --> 50:00.360
Ever mindful.

50:00.360 --> 50:01.360
He breathes in.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.360
Ever mindful.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.360
He breathes out.

50:04.360 --> 50:10.360
So, by having that established mindfulness, properly in front of yourself,

50:10.360 --> 50:21.360
I'll just say that in front of your face, in front of your appropriation.

50:21.360 --> 50:23.360
Then let the body do it, see.

50:23.360 --> 50:25.360
So, you notice him now.

50:25.360 --> 50:26.360
So, he got that established.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.360
But from a different direction.

50:28.360 --> 50:37.360
It must know that there's the breath.

50:37.360 --> 50:39.360
And then you do mindfulness.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.360
That's mindfulness.

50:41.360 --> 50:45.360
And then you can also notice when you're anchored in that mindfulness.

50:45.360 --> 50:50.360
You can also then notice the sense of I am behind that breath.

50:50.360 --> 50:57.360
But now you're noticing it from that external anchored position in front.

50:57.360 --> 51:00.360
So, that's self.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.360
That's quite everywhere.

51:03.360 --> 51:06.360
But now you are not there with it.

51:06.360 --> 51:09.360
You will be that mindfulness to the fore.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.360
Mindfulness around the mouth.

51:10.360 --> 51:11.360
Mind from the front.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.360
So, that becomes now your viewing point.

51:14.360 --> 51:16.360
There has no room for the self in it.

51:16.360 --> 51:19.360
So, then you see that you see that body breathing.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.360
You see in breath, out breath, whatever.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.360
You see the act of breathing.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.360
And then you even see on top of the act of breathing,

51:25.360 --> 51:28.360
in the further distance you see that sense of self.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.360
But seeing it from a different angle means, oh,

51:30.360 --> 51:33.360
this is just another phenomenon that arises in regard to things

51:33.360 --> 51:36.360
as pretty much all the other phenomena.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.360
That arise.

51:37.360 --> 51:40.360
Thus, it shares the nature of all the other phenomena,

51:40.360 --> 51:44.360
which is they are not self.

51:44.360 --> 51:47.360
And then it becomes apparent that you had your sense of self,

51:47.360 --> 51:49.360
not because there was self,

51:49.360 --> 51:54.360
but because you had the attitude of regarding things as mine.

51:54.360 --> 51:59.360
People think, I am thus things as mine.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.360
It's actually the way around.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.360
It's because you regard things as mine.

52:03.360 --> 52:06.360
You generate the sense of I am.

52:12.360 --> 52:20.360
And seeing the self as not self

52:20.360 --> 52:24.360
makes that which used to be taken as self,

52:24.360 --> 52:29.360
now just remain a selfless individual.

52:29.360 --> 52:39.360
Individual in terms of still like a reflection of the five aggregates.

52:39.360 --> 52:47.360
So to speak, the experience as a whole has its own, basically.

52:47.360 --> 52:51.360
Well, let's say it has like a meeting point,

52:51.360 --> 52:55.360
which would be though the mind.

52:55.360 --> 52:59.360
Like the sign of the mind that we spoke before as well.

52:59.360 --> 53:02.360
It's like a meeting point, which is what usually they say,

53:02.360 --> 53:03.360
well, always.

53:03.360 --> 53:06.360
Where the set always sends a self to putogenesis.

53:06.360 --> 53:09.360
It's where the sign of the mind is,

53:09.360 --> 53:13.360
which means that's why it's rather easy to keep maintaining this

53:13.360 --> 53:16.360
and self as most people don't even see that sign of the mind.

53:16.360 --> 53:20.360
And seeing sign of the mind just means seeing mind as a phenomenon,

53:20.360 --> 53:22.360
however general.

53:22.360 --> 53:25.360
So unless you start seeing the sign of the mind,

53:25.360 --> 53:31.360
you won't be able to establish the mindfulness of any kind that's relevant.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.360
So like, for example, in such a paternal suit,

53:33.360 --> 53:36.360
a mindful of the mind states,

53:36.360 --> 53:39.360
all that requires proper seeing of the sign of the mind.

53:39.360 --> 53:43.360
So you can discern it for what it is at the time.

53:43.360 --> 53:47.360
And it's a very sign of the mind that is taking,

53:47.360 --> 53:51.360
it's because it just feels like a center of the experience.

53:51.360 --> 53:59.360
It's taken to be that sense of self, that sense of I am.

53:59.360 --> 54:03.360
But if then you start developing through the mindfulness properly established,

54:03.360 --> 54:08.360
pretty much like an external point of view towards your own internal situation,

54:08.360 --> 54:12.360
then that sign of mind and that sense of self just become the extensions

54:12.360 --> 54:17.360
of the same principle of arising phenomena,

54:17.360 --> 54:19.360
in what I just said.

54:19.360 --> 54:23.360
Like if your mindfulness is established in front,

54:23.360 --> 54:25.360
and then there is an act of breathing,

54:25.360 --> 54:27.360
and then while breathing, through the act of breathing,

54:27.360 --> 54:29.360
you discern the sense of I am.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.360
Your mind doesn't go back to the sense of it.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.360
It stays in the front,

54:33.360 --> 54:37.360
but now looks back and it sees that sense of I am still there,

54:37.360 --> 54:41.360
which means it's another indifferent, independent phenomenon that has a reason

54:41.360 --> 54:44.360
to seem like all the other phenomena,

54:44.360 --> 54:47.360
which means it's not me, it's not mine, it's not I am.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.360
It's not that special center.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.360
There was always behind things, because now look,

54:51.360 --> 54:54.360
I just see this one of the things, it's out there.

54:54.360 --> 55:00.360
And if these things disappear, it cannot remain standing.

55:00.360 --> 55:04.360
And if you want to look closer at that sense of I am,

55:04.360 --> 55:09.360
most often you find like a basically being underlined by the notions

55:09.360 --> 55:12.360
and concepts and images involving your own face,

55:12.360 --> 55:15.360
your own physical appearance,

55:15.360 --> 55:21.360
your own point of view of the appropriated eyes,

55:21.360 --> 55:24.360
here, inside.

55:24.360 --> 55:29.360
But now that here, inside, is seen as just external,

55:29.360 --> 55:33.360
another thing, external thing,

55:33.360 --> 55:36.360
a reason upon external determinations.

55:36.360 --> 55:39.360
So then no matter how internally it is,

55:39.360 --> 55:44.360
it cannot be internally taken as mine anymore.

56:00.360 --> 56:04.360
So how do you get rid of subjectivity?

56:04.360 --> 56:06.360
Well, you don't get rid of it.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.360
You just stop regarding it as yours,

56:08.360 --> 56:10.360
then it seems to be a subjectivity.

56:10.360 --> 56:13.360
It just becomes your individuality.

56:21.360 --> 56:24.360
And you stop regarding it as yours,

56:24.360 --> 56:26.360
not by saying this is not mine,

56:26.360 --> 56:28.360
because it becomes another part of your subjectivity.

56:28.360 --> 56:30.360
But by developing point of view,

56:30.360 --> 56:33.360
there has no room for it.

56:33.360 --> 56:36.360
And that point of view is the view of in front,

56:36.360 --> 56:38.360
around the mouth, around the face,

56:38.360 --> 56:39.360
around the head,

56:39.360 --> 57:06.360
or ahead of the center places.

57:06.360 --> 57:13.360
And mindfulness is not the other way.

57:13.360 --> 57:16.360
It can be mindful that you have to have a body,

57:16.360 --> 57:18.360
only have to be alive.

57:18.360 --> 57:21.360
Yeah, of course.

57:21.360 --> 57:29.360
But mindfulness being much larger,

57:29.360 --> 57:31.360
you know, larger in a sense,

57:31.360 --> 57:33.360
it covers all.

57:33.360 --> 57:36.360
It can cover all things.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.360
It can be in front of everything.

57:39.360 --> 57:42.360
Well, it can't be in front of the body.

57:42.360 --> 57:43.360
Mindfulness.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.360
Yeah.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.360
I mean, sorry.

57:45.360 --> 57:48.360
It can be in front in the sense of the practice.

57:48.360 --> 57:52.360
But it can't go underneath the body.

57:52.360 --> 57:55.360
It can't go underneath the matter,

57:55.360 --> 58:01.360
which is why it's possible to be mindful in the first place.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.360
It can't go underneath.

58:03.360 --> 58:05.360
It's because the body is already there.

58:05.360 --> 58:07.360
The sense bases are already there.

58:07.360 --> 58:11.360
You can establish your mindfulness upon that,

58:11.360 --> 58:15.360
upon the physical presence of the sense organs,

58:15.360 --> 58:20.360
upon the physical presence of the body out there.

58:20.360 --> 58:23.360
But that mindfulness can't step outside of there.

58:23.360 --> 58:27.360
They have been mindful in stepping outside of the five aggregates.

58:27.360 --> 58:30.360
And that's impossible.

58:30.360 --> 58:37.360
But I know what you mean.

58:37.360 --> 58:44.360
When you say that mindfulness includes everything.

58:44.360 --> 58:46.360
That's in that mindfulness.

58:46.360 --> 58:47.360
That includes everything.

58:47.360 --> 58:52.360
Within that, you go further and you find the body already there.

58:52.360 --> 58:55.360
Within that mindfulness.

58:55.360 --> 58:56.360
So, sure.

58:56.360 --> 59:03.360
From the point of view of putuginous world, that mindfulness includes everything.

59:03.360 --> 59:04.360
But you don't stop there.

59:04.360 --> 59:09.360
You look at it further and then you see that that mindfulness basically founded

59:09.360 --> 59:20.360
upon the presence of a physical body that you have no control over.

59:20.360 --> 59:22.360
Hence, you can't appropriate that mindfulness.

59:22.360 --> 59:29.360
It's simply no room for any subjectivity, impossible.

59:44.360 --> 59:46.360
And it's good to keep drilling this.

59:46.360 --> 59:50.360
Because on some days all these things will make perfect sense.

59:50.360 --> 59:53.360
Everything will feel like it's all in the place.

59:53.360 --> 59:56.360
Then two or three days later, the doubt sets in.

59:56.360 --> 59:59.360
And then you just, it doesn't seem to fit with anything.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.360
That's exactly the point.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.360
Then you keep drilling until it falls in place.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360
Then it falls out of place.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.360
Then you keep drilling until it falls in place.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.360
And then it will stop falling out of place.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.360
Because you widen the basis of your mindfulness.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.360
You widen the basis of your discernment.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.360
And now the doubt cannot enter it from any angle.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.360
So, when the doubt does enter it, instead of filling a coma,

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.360
goodness, whether it's wrong, no.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.360
You take that as basically having your work cut out for you.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.360
Oh, see, the doubt can enter it from this angle.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.360
That's the angle I have to work now.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:54.360
So, to remove the doubt.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:04.360
So, in terms of the genres again, but in particular with the suitors.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.360
This is with the joy that is born of seclusion.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.360
He drenches, steep fills, evades this body,

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:18.360
so that there's no part of his whole body and pervaded for the joy.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:23.360
He doesn't do it from his point of view of the sense of self.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.360
He doesn't do it from his subjectivity.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.360
He does it from the externally established mindfulness to the fore.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.360
From that point, he pervades this body.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.360
Intentionally.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.360
Yeah.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.360
But even that intention won't be appropriated then,

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:02.360
because his mind is established to the fore.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.360
Around the mouth.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.360
Around the converging point.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.360
So, in the mind is established around the converging point.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.360
Looking back from the converging point,

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.360
then he pervades and spews this and so on.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.360
Everything that's on the other side of the converging point,

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:24.360
which is the entire bodily domain.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.360
And he sends himself.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360
Wow.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.360
It's not there at the time, but that's where he sends self rise.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:58.360
No, no.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:03.360
Obviously, it speaks of the bodily parts.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.360
See, you gain your mind for the converging point.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.360
Yeah, all of those bodily parts, all of them.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:20.360
I mean, is there anything that could stand for basically the physical aspect of your body?

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.360
Your body, basically.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.360
All of those parts can serve as a coverage point if taken up readily.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.360
And saying, seeing as a converging point is nothing other than saying,

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:33.360
seeing is that because of which your whole world is already there.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.360
Seeing it as a necessary condition to the experience as a whole.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:41.360
Seeing it as a determination to your existence.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.360
Of your entire life.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.360
And everything that comes with it, emotions, feelings,

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.360
happiness, sadness, ideas, hopes, ambitions, everything.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360
You're in feces.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.360
You're in feces, nails, hair.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.360
Oh, so your whole life stands upon the presence of these things.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.360
That's nothing to rejoice over.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.360
Nothing to feel passionate about.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.360
On the contrary, it's something to recognize.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.360
Oh, this will come to a abrupt end.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.360
Always, death is always abrupt.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.360
So this will come to an abrupt end.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.360
And it's actually quite displeasing, quite frightening.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.360
The fact that it depends upon these random external things

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.360
that are composed in this body, random matter, random elements,

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.360
there absolutely no say over, no control over,

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:35.360
can't even conceive it in the wildest of abstractions,

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.360
can't conceive how it would be to control these elements.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.360
You're just inconceivable, yet my whole life depends upon it.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.360
Everything.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.360
And that's like any passion towards it,

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.360
any desire towards it, any joy towards it.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.360
It would disappear.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.360
So for somebody who is still very much inside of it

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.360
that seems very frightening,

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.360
they would seem very frightening.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.360
Oh my goodness, so what?

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.360
The banner is a joyless state on the contrary.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.360
The joy, well basically, say you have a joy

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.360
on account of drinking a pleasant beverage,

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.360
that's full of poison.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:18.360
You can't taste, smell, touch, see, nothing.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.360
You don't know, you can't access that poison through any senses,

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.360
but you know it's there.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360
And it's the most pleasant beverage.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.360
That's a seemingly from the suitors.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.360
So if you don't know the poison's there,

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.360
you'd be enjoying that beverage, wouldn't you?

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.360
Because it's just pleasing in every possible aspect.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:39.360
And then somebody tells you there is poison in it,

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.360
there will kill you.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.360
So would, by not drinking it then,

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.360
you would give up the joy of drinking it,

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.360
the joy of the pleasant taste, the joy of the pleasant consistency

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.360
or whatever smell, the joy of the pleasant drink.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.360
You would give that up, but you would then replace it

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.360
with a much greater joy of knowing

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.360
that you are basically not going to be killed

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.360
by enjoying that poison.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.360
Oh, my goodness, I saved my own life.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:13.360
So basically by abandoning the joys of worldly sensual life,

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:20.360
the joys that arise on a basis of sensual pleasures,

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.360
you abandon all the dangers with it,

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:27.360
and that can result in quite a non-worldly joy,

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:43.360
joy of freedom, joy of liberation.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:58.360
It gets to sleep in the joy, let's leave you alone.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:21.360
And this game says,

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.360
when it's developed and cultivated in mind,

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.360
most of the body, Mara cannot find opportunity

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:32.360
and support within the same other days.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:34.360
But Mara is yourself.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.360
Yeah.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.360
He is you.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.360
It's a very dear sense of self that Mara is.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:47.360
So if you remove yourself from it,

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:51.360
Mara can find any basis on it.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.360
And he's supporting you.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:08:15.360
He can see it basically.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:28.360
So the mindfulness is the wakeful one.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:31.360
He always mindfulness sees you.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.360
Right.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.360
Yeah.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:40.360
Yeah.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.360
The mindfulness is established upon the right order of things,

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.360
or the physical senses beforehand,

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.360
simultaneously present with things that depend upon them.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.360
That's the mindfulness you are not doing.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360
That's the mindfulness that includes you,

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.360
as opposed to you performing it.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.360
So you find that mindfulness.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.360
You establish it upon that which is already there,

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.360
the presence of the body.

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.360
Again.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.360
Now, in that sense, I'm mindful of the body,

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:12.360
or I'm observing bodily sensations.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.360
No, that's putting you first.

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.360
Still, keeping you in the center,

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.360
and then you're observing these things that are...

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.360
No.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.360
You want to forget about your sense of self,

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.360
and establish your mindfulness upon these external things.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.360
There needs to be seen as that,

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.360
because of which, well,

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:36.360
you are able to even look at any external things.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.360
Or internal, or internal,

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360
any external things.

01:09:39.360 --> 01:10:06.360
It precise them all.
