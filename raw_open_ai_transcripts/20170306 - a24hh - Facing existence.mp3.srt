1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I come in question, and I keep hearing you say, why is my existence said to be Dukka?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Why is my life Dukka?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You mean house by the people who don't necessarily would think that that's the case?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Why is existence? Why is the existence Dukka?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What is meant by that?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, what is meant by that?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, what is meant by that?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Probably talked about it before.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if it didn't, it basically comes down to the possibility of suffering.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And that's it.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You exist means suffering can touch you.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's it, can.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My non necessarily do so.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But the fact that it might, that is suffering itself.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That possibility, if you might suffer at any given time, at any given moment,

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
means your existence is suffering.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's a very happy life.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Never experience any misfortune.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nothing like that, which is quite unlikely, but say an ideal case scenario.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But the fact that at any given moment of your life, you might meet with this more fortunate or anything,

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that you might find that disagreeable means that possibility, that kind of blooming possibility.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But the record is that you feel unpleasant in regard to it.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thus, you feel unpleasant in regard to your existence.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thus, existence is Dukka.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So it's better not to look at it.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, no, that's what most people do.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because that's just the ignorant default response.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You just don't look at your existence.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's why so many people are afraid of boredom.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But generally, terrified of being bored, terrified of not having anything to do,

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
there's no distraction to keep them floating on the surface.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why? Because then all these things emerge.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Because they are always there.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So the only way that you can kind of cope, not resolve an issue by cope,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
would be to find plentiful distractions, chase your desires like a maniac as much as you can.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So they keep your gaze diverted from that, which is underneath.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But boredom.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So there's nothing taking your attention away.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This weight just kind of shows itself.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It doesn't come onto you because it's actually always there.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It just gets revealed again.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And you can actually, you know, sometimes you have people, no, man,

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
there's not my life's good.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sometimes bad, but generally it's quite annoying.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I disagree with everything in suffering.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Everything is not suffering in terms of everything is miserable.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But everything can be suffering.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Everything put potentially cause you suffering.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And then it's suffering itself on a very subtle level.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Suffol, but profound.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a subtle, I don't mean like tiny, significant, nst.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So even those people, just if they were to be locked in for 24 hours or something

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
without any distraction, I think they could have changed their mind.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Except boredom would treat them up.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You've been busy with the things that make you kind of give you pleasure.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, it's like that's an extra drop.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, you're busy for various reasons.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And they'll kind of merge into this motivation that's rooted in our hearts.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And also because you've been busy because you basically don't want to look at the problem of your existence.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So you're finding things to do that you tell yourself are very important and need to be done.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's my duty. It's my duty to do this.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, you choose your duties.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Literally, and you got to anything and everything.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So you do things because basically you're running away from looking at your existence.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So being busy keeps you distracted.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then sometimes, well, often, things that you are doing are also providing you with sense pleasure as well.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So not just that you are distracted initially from the problem,

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
but then you also have pleasure on top of that.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So you can see how it's easily very intoxicating and then people never look back.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What?

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because there's always something going on.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Until there isn't. Until you get sick. Until you get off.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Until you die.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, it provides the double.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The distraction and the pleasure.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And then, obviously, it proliferates.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The more things you do, the more things you create, the more things you do.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Based on things you do.

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But the initial motivation of being distracted from the problem of existence,

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
that's like a thread that pertains to whatever you do, basically.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So you do this and then because you do something more, something more, something more, something more.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And you spend your whole life doing it, but that thread is in common all of it.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And that's how people, you know, the cases when people have been doing things their whole life,

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
working or whatever, and then they get old.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then the moment they're not able to physically perform things, the whole life they've been doing,

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the mind goes, they lose it, they go quickly.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There's an injury or something, that's it.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Within a week, they're gone, like mentally.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You don't recognize people, nothing.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Because the whole life, it was just depending on that little thing.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And that's inevitable.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That is inevitable.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The old age is so hard, you know, in the suitors, they would have worked often.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And what people would come to with and say, yes, indeed, you know, I remember when I was, you know,

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I could catch a galloping horse and I was, you know, finding my youth and so on.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Now, I want to put my foot here, but it goes there, I like that completely.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And that's so hard because imagine a person who spent their whole life depending on their senses for this distraction.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There was an underlying pleasure and so on.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
To not look at the existence, that was the sole purpose.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And now the senses fail. Now you can't see.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can't hear.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let alone provide yourself with many full pleasures of sights and so on.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Not just failing.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Which means that whole, well, that sole motivation for pursuing the senses and the distraction and so on.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There was provided through that.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's just again there. And now there's no escape from it.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So, all people very often become very unhappy.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Even if there's nothing necessarily, just unhappiness, miserable, angry, anything.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Just not in a good place.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Because you can't distract yourself anymore.

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Or they try to distract themselves with their family and grandchildren.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
With the joy, the thoughts of my grandchildren.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Because nothing, your senses don't provide you.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You can't even see them. You're blind now. You can't hear them.

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But you think about it.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Which is, like, again, even more perilous position because it's a completely independent people.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So, when they do something that you do not,

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
there's exactly one thing I'm going to bring up now.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There's, I was looking at some people that I know they have, you know,

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the father and the mother, their daughter as a child.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And now the grandparents are obsessed and completely encroached in that grandchild.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That little girl, and she's, you know, the center of their universe, the center of their world.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And just provide a major distraction to, you know,

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
everything else is pushed to the side, basically.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The center of the area is that.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But all their happiness, and I was looking at some of their photos.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
All their happiness.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They look very happy and excited.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The baby is always in the center, literally in the center all the time.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And you can just see how much their happiness, how much their happiness depends on their child.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That little girl and the things that could go wrong.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If something happens that will go.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
She could hurt, she dies, all of a sudden.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You got, you know, these four people's lives are completely,

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that's done destroyed.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And they had themselves to plan it.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The full responsible for placing so much importance on that child.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And I don't mean, I mean, so much emotional importance for them.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sure you look after it, of course.

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But placing so much importance for the purpose of distraction and pleasure

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and not looking at your own existence.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So then, yeah, when something does happen, it will.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's again, in the suitors.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When the child dies, you know, they found their own streets destroyed.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where they gone, my son.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's when it, the Buddha says, yeah, suffering, limitation.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It comes from that.

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And those who, which idea.

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And they had mad, who suffered because of his son is gone.

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He says, what are you talking about?

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He said, when the Buddha told him that the family and the children are so suffering.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And the man says, no, no, we're talking about this.

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So it's a pleasure.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And he went to another ascetic and something.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No, he went to the gamblers on the side of the road.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The gamblers.

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
People were really obviously so good.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Most likely agree with him.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And they said, no, of course you were right, the Buddha was wrong.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And then the queen reported it to the king.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, she had the report to her, then the king said,

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
sure, the king, the king heard that.

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And he went to the queen because she was the supporter of the Buddha.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And he said, see, like I also disagree with the Buddha.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It is because, look, all these children are so suffering.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then she went to the Buddha and it would explain.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And she went to the king and said, do you know your favorite son, your favorite child?

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If something happens to him right now, like that you can't prevent.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If he dies for the ill, would you be, of course, of course I would be believing.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I would be destroyed.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, that's how children are so suffering.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And I mean, you know, it sounds obvious.

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And it is obvious.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But that's obvious on the intellectual level.

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But emotionally, that might not mean anything if people are fully attached.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They'll just ignore the fact because they're already fully dependent upon it.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But ultimately, at the end of the day,

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
they're trying to become very dying.

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And you can't have them.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's why it's not just that it's not a solution.

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's a coping mechanism that basically makes things worse.

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because the worse, the harder you're running away from something,

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that you ultimately cannot escape.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The harder it will hit you.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But most people don't know that they're running away.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They're not intense, you know?

192
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, it's an act of bad faith, so they're not fully aware.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But the reason they're not fully aware is because they don't allow themselves

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
to be fully aware of it.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They're not fully aware of it.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But that's not exactly.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's why bad faith is that it's an unwholesome attitude.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Where basically you convince yourself.

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But in order to convince yourself of such things,

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you need to know what you convince yourself against.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So they basically threw that bad, threw that running away from their resistance.

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They're carrying that reason for running away.

203
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So you can't really escape it.

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So you're making it worse because it becomes implied in everything you do.

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And then ultimately, it catches you as you would have always done

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
because it's just...

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And that's why, that's why, for many people,

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
centrality and giving up centrality, it's not.

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's high because it's not just, oh, it's not just that you're giving up

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
pleasures, they come through your senses.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But then you're giving up the only means of

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
a soul of escape that you know from that weight of your resistance

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
depending kind of looming possibility of suffering.

214
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You think you're landing on you, crushing you.

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So that's why, for people, centrality, it's not really optional.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I mean, it is optional, not just a matter of choice,

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
but it's not just about pleasure.

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's about having distraction to keep you floating on top of your resistance

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
whereby you won't have to look down below.

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's just in our space to breathe, but that's about it.

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Beneath us for somebody who's now got the idea

222
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and who's looking, oh, my resistance is a problem,

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and I'm going to die.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I must not practice it, it's a value in awareness.

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Well, then they have to start going against that old grain upstream.

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah.

227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because, you know, everything, the desire of the senses,

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
the running away, everything points down.

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So it's easy to give in.

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So when you recognize that they're just making things worse,

231
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
now you actually have to stand against that flood

232
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and then go the other way.

233
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So, well, you can imagine how hard that is.

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What do you want them to imagine?

235
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're doing it.

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But basically, that's why many people, and again,

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
because you know that deep down, you know,

238
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
that you are running away.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
As I said, because you're carrying those reasons,

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
as you're running away, because that's why you're running away.

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
When you do, if you do, stop and think about going against the grain,

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
then you just feel like, ah, hard and heavy, that will be.

243
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And that flood will most likely take,

244
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and then you're just carrying on.

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Just pretend and just go down with the flow.

246
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But for someone who's going out, you know,

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
like a grand, grand daughter.

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You don't love so much.

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
How do they?

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, theoretically, it's possible, but practically,

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
it's pretty much impossible, because they spend 80 years of their life

252
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
cultivating habits that were going with that flood,

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
with the flow, with the distraction, with the desire.

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So that look, that looks.

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So basically, they got so entrenched now in those directions

256
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
that there are simply the faculties and not strong enough.

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The mind is not strong enough to theoretically,

258
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
yeah, as there were cases in the suitors, the old lady.

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you remember when she had three sons?

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They married and children, everything.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And she and her husband were really well to do.

262
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And her husband died.

263
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And she thought, well, why don't I divide all of our property?

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And they had a lot of it, and give to my three sons.

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And they looked after me.

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And she did that.

267
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And they looked after her in the beginning.

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But then, basically, they were just started

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
well, being annoyed by her.

270
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They didn't like her.

271
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So she would be going to visit one son,

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and she would hear the daughter and all saying,

273
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
well, look, look who's coming again.

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She has other sons as well to look after her.

275
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But she's coming here only.

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Then she heard that from all of them

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and got basically completely heartbroken.

278
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And she was, well, over 80 probably.

279
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Given, you know, grown-up grandchildren as well.

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And then she, she ordained because she didn't have anyone else to stay.

281
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And she saw the nuns having a monastery and getting food.

282
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But she couldn't go pin the bun because she was too old.

283
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So she was staying behind and cleaning the monastery

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and pin the bun.

285
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But she was quite junior.

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
She never met the Buddha.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But one night, she had one nun repeating to another nun

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
what the Buddha said about impermanence.

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And that, like, one of two lines.

290
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
She was basically contemplated on day and night.

291
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
While she was cleaning.

292
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And then at night, she would be blue and walking meditation

293
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in the corridor.

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But she was so, she couldn't walk.

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So she was leaning on the wall with her hands.

296
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And she was walking up and down.

297
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And she became another hand.

298
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So you can say, wow, she would.

299
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That was so basically, she put in hard work

300
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
after being completely broken by her own family,

301
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
by her own children, abandoned.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Basically, the very last stage of life.

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But that little instruction, she got second hand.

304
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
She drilled it in deep enough until penetrated ignorance

305
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and everything else.

306
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And she became another hand.

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So it is possible, theoretically.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And in a very rare cases.

309
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So for omitting.

310
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah.

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
My little one.

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You don't have to go around.

313
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Trying to let everyone abandon you.

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
No, of course not.

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Just recommend this possibility that they might happen.

316
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And that's more than enough to go on.

317
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
In terms of practice.

318
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There's the, you know, not a bit of a saying about the vertical view.

319
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And how to maintain the vertical view.

320
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And not to run away.

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And hide in distractions.

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah.

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
How do you, as a monk, as someone is practicing?

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How do you...

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, by developing mindfulness.

326
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In their life.

327
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Not mindfulness in terms of some kind of weird robotic method,

328
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
meditation, repetition, noting.

329
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But mindfulness in a sense of recognizing intentions behind your actions.

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Because for as long as you have performed a certain action,

331
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
intention to do that action is there on a more general level.

332
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's your mindful of the reasons why you're doing things,

333
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
why you want to do things.

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And if they're rooted in unwholesome, you don't do it.

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If it's something you have to do, then you re-root it into something

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that's not unwholesome.

337
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Okay.

338
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Such as eating food, as we discussed before.

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It can be rooted in a very unwholesome sense of pure sensuality.

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Or if you contemplate and dwell on it and drill it long enough,

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
you can root it in no.

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll root it in necessity and I don't care what I eat.

343
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Whether it's the softest, nicest food or the roughest.

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Because you remain rooted in necessity of eating food

345
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
to sustain the body so you can practice.

346
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So by being aware of your reasons and intentions,

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
you will basically...

348
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Well, you won't be able to fall into bad faith.

349
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You won't be able to fall into that self-deception.

350
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And you won't be doing things for the sake of distraction.

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So that's how the vertical view is maintained.

352
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Or, well, developed.

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because it will take time to kind of elevate your mind

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
to start looking vertically at the nature of things.

355
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Because it's been just going, you know, flowing very horizontally

356
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
with a powerful flow of sensuality and distraction.

357
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So that's why people who don't...

358
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Well, people haven't been practicing, but they might get ahead of it.

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Like, say a layperson, including myself at the time,

360
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
when you discover Buddhism and then...

361
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But then you can't differentiate.

362
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Then when you recognize that you've been doing things for the sake of distraction,

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
then it feels like whatever you do,

364
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
it was done because of that distraction.

365
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And most likely it was.

366
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But it doesn't mean that they won't be appointing the future whereby you can then do things.

367
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They won't be rooted in the distraction.

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So people sort of can't differentiate.

369
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And then they try...

370
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, they attempt to throw the whole thing away and then stop doing anything.

371
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I must not do this.

372
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I must not...

373
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Like what I was...

374
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I must not exercise.

375
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I must not go out.

376
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I must not go out for a walk.

377
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I must not sit in the nature.

378
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
No, no projects.

379
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
No, nothing.

380
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But that's impossible because that then becomes your doing of not doing anything.

381
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's what you're actively performing and you're not aware of it.

382
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Which means you're not actually developing mindfulness in regard to the intentions and the actions properly.

383
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And people like that, again, including myself,

384
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
when you see others doing,

385
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
it's all done for the distraction.

386
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But it's not.

387
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, it can be, but not necessarily.

388
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So you need to know the motivation.

389
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And we discussed that before.

390
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like you're in the monastery,

391
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you want to go down to the reception room where the library is.

392
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So you look why...

393
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, where is your intention to do that?

394
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Where is it rooted?

395
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Is it rooted in the desire to maybe find some people or other monks there

396
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and have something to chat with because you were actually bored in your room?

397
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But then you can't admit that to yourself.

398
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So then you say, no, I want to go and get some books to read,

399
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
some good useful books to read.

400
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But the real reason remains rooted in going,

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
hoping to meet people there to chat for half an hour and get a bit of entertainment

402
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
or whatever.

403
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Or distracted just because your room is getting too heavy.

404
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Or then if it's rooted in that, you don't do it.

405
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If you still want...

406
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
If you still think, well, no, I do want to get those books.

407
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And you make sure you stay focused on the reason...

408
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
on the wholesome reason for going down to the reception room where the library was

409
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
to get the books.

410
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And then even if you do meet other people,

411
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
well, you won't be entertaining that as you will be getting your books and getting back up.

412
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
As opposed to, I will not do anything.

413
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I will just sit in this room.

414
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And that's it.

415
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I will never leave.

416
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That still will not re-root your intentions,

417
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
which means you'll still remain rooted in that wholesome.

418
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And wholesome, you'll just abstain from it.

419
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Sure, that should be a default response if you don't know what to do.

420
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Abstain from it.

421
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Again, if in doubt, don't do it.

422
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Like, well, in vinegar.

423
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Acting out of doubt, it's a minor offense.

424
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Even if actually what you've done wasn't an offense.

425
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The fact that you acted out of doubt was a minor offense.

426
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But that doesn't mean you should actually cultivate that

427
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and stain that doubt for the rest of your life.

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But you should be asking why.

429
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Well, exactly.

430
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So I don't know.

431
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So I'm not going to do it.

432
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But then I'm going to see why, how, and if you re-root it,

433
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
then you can do it.

434
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Again, was it marked with Japanese?

435
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah.

436
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
When she asked about that, oh, I'm going for the Vassa retreat.

437
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm going to be in seclusion for three months.

438
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Give me a brief instruction so I can...

439
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And he said, whatever you know is an wholesome abandon it.

440
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Whatever you know, it's wholesome.

441
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Don't attend it.

442
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And she...

443
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That was enough for Harara and she after three months.

444
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Because people realize they are kind of entrenched in an wholesome.

445
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Then they fear everything.

446
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You know, you try to fear yourself from an wholesome.

447
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But the false response is throwing everything away,

448
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
including wholesome and not whole everything.

449
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I will not do anything ever again because everything is an wholesome.

450
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Everything is done for the distraction.

451
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Everything is done because of my ego, my conceit.

452
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
No.

453
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's done because of ego and conceit and vanity.

454
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
If that's where it's rooted.

455
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If you don't rooted in those unwholesome things,

456
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
you won't be done for those purposes.

457
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Externally, people might not be able to tell the difference.

458
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
They'll say, oh, look, he's all vain and conceited, arrogant.

459
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But they can't tell the difference.

460
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Because they themselves are rooted in those things.

461
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's what they see.

462
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I mean, you know, the Buddha himself.

463
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
He said, when the first man he met after the life,

464
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and he said, I'm the greatest.

465
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm self-embodied.

466
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Nobody's my teacher.

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And that's factual.

468
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But for the man who himself is a victim of his own conceit and vanity,

469
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
he's a proof.

470
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So beat, my friend.

471
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
The role he's either left.

472
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Thinking, what was he thinking here?

473
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What he was the Buddha.

474
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Because he couldn't judge.

475
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
He couldn't tell.

476
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Because, you know.

477
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So that's why there is obviously the unwholesome things

478
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
that cannot be done against the presets.

479
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But in all of the other things, in between,

480
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
things that are not necessarily good or bad,

481
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
you know, they are determined by your intention

482
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
that's behind performing those actions.

483
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So as I said, going to the library,

484
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can be a bad thing.

485
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh, I want to go on to my Sutta study group.

486
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well, that's a very noble thing to do.

487
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Well, not necessarily.

488
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
If you are going there because you want to be, you know,

489
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
checking people up or distracting yourself

490
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
on the pretext of studying the Sutta's.

491
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So then some...

492
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But many people judge things.

493
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, judge book by its cover.

494
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Because it requires a degree of wisdom to not do so.

495
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh, the universe is accepted.

496
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The Sutta study group in the monastery is a good thing.

497
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We all go and do it.

498
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And probably like 90% of people might be doing it for completely wrong reasons.

499
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
As I can watch, because I witnessed it many times.

500
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
When people just go there, because you just feel like,

501
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
hey, we're doing something together, we're part of it.

502
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Just in the distraction, you're in the, you know,

503
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
silent retreats or something like that,

504
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but there's nothing that's happening.

505
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
No, no, this is good.

506
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And you feel justified.

507
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That's the thing.

508
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And by feeling justified, you must the fact that you yourself chose

509
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
to go there for the reasons of distraction

510
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
or something other unwholesome.

511
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But then you feel justified because externally,

512
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
that is generally accepted is a good thing to do.

513
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Ah, good, I'm fine then.

514
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But you're not actually.

515
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That is probably more dangerous.

516
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Than just strongly, just say no to everything.

517
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Like, I'm not doing anything.

518
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah, I'm not very painful, but I can at least bring some wisdom eventually.

519
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
As opposed to masking it like that.

520
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But this is good, because look, all of these senior Max said it's good,

521
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and all of these people do it.

522
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It can't be if you do it for the right reasons.

523
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Or is it all in as scholars?

524
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah.

525
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
People who can't do as scholars do.

526
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, it works.

527
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You feel good.

528
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Fully justified, spending your time, you know,

529
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
studying etymology stuff, but not for purpose,

530
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
getting the meaning, but for purpose, just becoming a scholar.

531
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But you feel, again, all right, you know,

532
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
spending five days, if you're weak,

533
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
just printing random CDs,

534
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
because they're all about the dama or whatever else.

535
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And then you're doing, you know, publication.

536
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Publications.

537
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And if you're full just because this is good work, it's dama work.

538
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You're doing it for completely wrong reasons.

539
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You're doing it because if you were to be put in the middle of the jungle right here,

540
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
you would probably free count.

541
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And if that doesn't worry you,

542
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
the fact that you're not able to exist anywhere in peace,

543
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
well, that means you're not really practicing correctly.

544
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Or at all.

545
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
No matter how much you know.

546
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
No matter how many years you spent,

547
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
dealing and working around and about the dama.

548
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You haven't got anything from it.

549
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Well, what is, you know,

550
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you get this idea of the right efforts

551
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
to abandon and hold some cultivators.

552
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But that idea comes across as

553
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
you've got to be doing something,

554
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
doing the duty.

555
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You go and learn the suitors.

556
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You do practice this.

557
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
A silver bar, a bar mask,

558
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
holding onto virtue and duty.

559
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
No, no, just rights and rituals.

560
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But duty, the rightful duty,

561
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
the duty of me as a monk,

562
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
the duty of holding on to it.

563
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And that's the thing.

564
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Holding on to it means doing it for the wrong reasons.

565
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So, as I said, initially,

566
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you have to hold on.

567
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That's a winner or a sealer comes first.

568
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You take it.

569
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You hold it.

570
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But in within that,

571
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
you're supposed to develop discernments

572
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
that then makes you let it go without actually externally

573
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
breaking it necessarily.

574
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Letting go of unwholesome.

575
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And letting go of wholesome,

576
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
you know, for another hand.

577
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Doesn't mean he goes and becomes wild or whatever else.

578
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So, it's that sense of duty, yeah?

579
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Because that's quite risky.

580
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Because your whole existence as a monk

581
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
or as somebody who practices with a teaching

582
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that you've invested 20 years in practicing Dharma,

583
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
doing the treats or whatever else,

584
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
there is that sense of duty

585
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
that has been built up.

586
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And now letting go of that

587
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
would basically expose your entire existence

588
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
since you became a monk.

589
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Your entire, basically, investment.

590
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Your entire life.

591
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So that's where many people never do it.

592
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But that's like people

593
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
who try to cross the show

594
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
but are too afraid and they stay.

595
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So they came to the show.

596
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
They found what they need to cross.

597
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But they're too afraid to actually start crossing it.

598
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So they just stay in that show,

599
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
looking at the other show

600
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
they're supposed to go

601
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and they're often happy with that.

602
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because no matter how much,

603
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
how many years you spend cultivating

604
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and preparing,

605
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
when you start crossing that river,

606
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it's not a guarantee

607
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that you will get to the other side.

608
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But that is the risk

609
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
that needs to be taken.

610
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You can't.

611
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You can't answer it.

612
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
No.

613
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Because if I try, I might fail.

614
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So I better not try

615
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and then just remain concerned

616
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
about trying but never do so.

617
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And that's like people who spend their life

618
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
studying about the Dharma,

619
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
the scholarly aspect.

620
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I mean, all the scholars do that

621
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
but many would do it for those reasons.

622
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So you end up evolving around it

623
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
but never really getting through with it.

624
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Collecting information

625
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
from this teacher and teachers.

626
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Learning about the other show

627
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
on the second hand.

628
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Then write effort.

629
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Write effort.

630
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
How to do that?

631
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
What is there?

632
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's when they say

633
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
by doing things full-on with heavy energy.

634
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
The right effort will be determined

635
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
by the right view.

636
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Because the right view always comes first.

637
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So right effort will be...

638
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Again, it's what I was speaking about.

639
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Make sure...

640
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Well, right effort, right intention.

641
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Right effort will come from right intention

642
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
which will come from right view

643
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and right view would be making sure

644
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
the things you're about to do,

645
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
the things you want to do.

646
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The things you feel you need to do

647
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
are not rooted in the unwholesome.

648
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
There are duties you just have to do.

649
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But even then,

650
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
it doesn't mean you shouldn't be mindful of them.

651
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Or you should feel justified in doing them.

652
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh, there are things I need to do.

653
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Bottom line is I always choose

654
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
to do these things.

655
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Even if it feels,

656
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
oh, I need to do this.

657
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah, you're the one who chooses that

658
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
to be that which you need to do.

659
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Can you make it effortless?

660
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Like, it's kind of...

661
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
What are you doing?

662
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You don't have the intentions to do it themselves.

663
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah.

664
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That would be the case of another hand.

665
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But that's the thing.

666
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Like, for protrusional,

667
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that would mean like,

668
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
you are not there.

669
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
These things are just done.

670
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And on paper,

671
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
that can be said to be true.

672
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But that can be achieved only

673
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
through fully doing them.

674
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So to speak.

675
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And by fully doing them,

676
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I mean fully,

677
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
thoroughly accepting responsibility

678
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
for every slightest intention

679
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
you choose to act upon.

680
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Not the other way.

681
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Not by kind of finding a state

682
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
where you forget about your intentions.

683
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And then things just happen.

684
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
No, that's completely the opposite.

685
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But it might kind of revolve around full circle

686
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and externally almost look the same.

687
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But there is this on the inner side,

688
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
there is this whole trajectory of a certain

689
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
that you actually have to go through with.

690
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And you go through that protrusional start

691
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
by fully accepting responsibility

692
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
for everything he does.

693
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Why?

694
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Because he chooses to do all of it.

695
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Even things that he has no choice about.

696
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So to speak.

697
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Things that happen to you,

698
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
happen to you because you've

699
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
taken, you've chosen to keep

700
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
that the other things can affect.

701
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So like misfortunes, accidents,

702
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
they're not really your fault.

703
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If they affect you,

704
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
well, that's a new why,

705
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
because you're holding onto the body,

706
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
there is subject to misfortunes.

707
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Subject to accidents and so on.

708
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So you take full responsibility

709
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
for things that you cannot possibly control.

710
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
That's why it's so hard and heavy,

711
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
especially in the beginning.

712
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But then, by fully accepting that responsibility,

713
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
you literally go through that responsibility

714
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
without abandoning it.

715
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And then you find the way out,

716
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
in case of another hunt,

717
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
whereby, while it does remain,

718
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
it's a pure individual.

719
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Pugula, just the five aggregates,

720
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
free from Upadana,

721
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and they just rise and fall

722
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
until they break apart.

723
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But that can be done only

724
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
when you actually go through

725
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
with a whole think of responsibility,

726
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
intention, not performing.

727
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So basically, unwholesome needs to be avoided,

728
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
not just,

729
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
or I keep the presets,

730
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
but even mentally.

731
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So even if it's not really,

732
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
if it's not really morally wrong,

733
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the fact that I was about to go to library

734
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
because I was becoming a bit anxious in my room,

735
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
so I needed a distraction.

736
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That is like shooting yourself in the head

737
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
from the point of view of dharma practice.

738
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That is a serious mistake.

739
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And you can,

740
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
you'll be impeccable externally,

741
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
perfect month form,

742
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and never break any rule.

743
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But you keep doing things like that,

744
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
you'll never ever progress in any way,

745
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
because you're just not really looking at the root,

746
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
at the core of the problem.

747
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You, as you said the other day,

748
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
you have resisting the possibility

749
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
of suffering, of pain, of pain.

750
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Even when there is no pain,

751
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
there is a possibility of pain,

752
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
which hurts you basically,

753
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and you're acting upon that.

754
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So you're acting because you're afraid.

755
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So you're acting out of unhulsing.

756
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So you're, so instead of going

757
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
part of that distraction,

758
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
you sit in your room,

759
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and the possibility of pain

760
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
starts becoming more of a reality of pain.

761
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Then you have to deal with it.

762
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's why I did that suit.

763
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And the Buddha said when he was in that jungle,

764
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
was it fear and dread?

765
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I think it was called fear and dread.

766
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
When he said if there would be a fear

767
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
or an awesome state arising while he was walking,

768
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
he would not change that posture

769
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
until he dispels the fear first.

770
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Why?

771
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Because whatever he would have done,

772
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
while the fear was present,

773
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
he would have been rooted in the fear.

774
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And he recognized that.

775
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
He could have been rooted in.

776
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
There's nothing unhulsing

777
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
with sitting down once you've been walking.

778
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But if you're doing it for the reasons of fear

779
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that arose while you were walking,

780
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
that is unhulsing.

781
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And nobody externally can tell you that,

782
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
because nobody externally can see that,

783
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
which is why don't pay much heed

784
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
to people judging things based on external factors.

785
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, and there's another sentence

786
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
that says there's monks or people

787
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
who are very agreeable, very soft-spoken,

788
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and people love them,

789
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and people praise them,

790
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and it's so great,

791
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
it's so nice, it's so nice,

792
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and they're completely ignorant to two generations.

793
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And then you had other people

794
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
who were monks and peoples

795
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
who were quite hard to live with,

796
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
unbearable root,

797
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
whatever else,

798
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and they were at hands.

799
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Because those things pertain

800
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
to basically the personal levels.

801
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So as you can see,

802
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I don't know.

803
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He said down because he was tired.

804
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's what externally might appear like.

805
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Well, no, he said down because he was afraid walking.

806
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Well, the monk who was storing rice

807
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and then rehydrating it the next day or so.

808
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh, the one because the village was too poor.

809
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah.

810
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And he didn't want them to waste the food,

811
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
because they would be starving.

812
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But then some people could say,

813
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
of what kind of monk is that?

814
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
He didn't keep that rule,

815
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and he exposed food.

816
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, the Buddha replied to him,

817
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
but not on that personal level,

818
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
but just from a higher perspective point of view,

819
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
whereby in the future,

820
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
doing that,

821
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
was most likely result in unwholesome,

822
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
because most people are not actually developed

823
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
as that monk.

824
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah, he was never.

825
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So then he said,

826
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
well, it's still don't do it.

827
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The intention was wholesome,

828
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
but externally, the vineyard,

829
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
don't do it because other people will not be able to do it.

830
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But the thing is,

831
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
the point I said,

832
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
people can,

833
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
people of Petruginus can praise and blame you

834
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
for just with that,

835
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
but praise and blame is not a measure

836
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
of somebody's attainments.

837
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
No.

838
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
If he gives blame or praise,

839
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
it's going to be on the level of...

840
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Of Petruginus.

841
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Of Petruginus.

842
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So if they praise you,

843
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
if the Petruginus praise an arrogant,

844
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
he does it for the wrong reasons,

845
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
because if he were to do it for the right reasons,

846
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
he would be at least sort of by himself,

847
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and he would know where the right reasons are.

848
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
If Petruginus blamed you again,

849
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
he does it for the wrong reasons,

850
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
because if he were to have the right ones,

851
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
he would be only comforting.

852
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah.

853
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Well, you know, people just assume,

854
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
you need to have,

855
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
well, based on,

856
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
based on your own,

857
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
you know,

858
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
life and learning or whatever,

859
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you just assume that,

860
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
a wise person,

861
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
person knows must be some, you know,

862
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
old man,

863
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
but then you had,

864
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
you had the suitors,

865
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
you had like,

866
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
what was that?

867
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
When the king came today,

868
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
the way they were staying,

869
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the first row, sort of,

870
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and the king went to see him,

871
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and King Pasinali, maybe.

872
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And on the way there,

873
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
he was meeting all these monks,

874
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
doing walk meditation

875
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and just just living there,

876
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
with a young,

877
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
in the prime of their youth,

878
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
a life that could still fully,

879
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
enjoy central pleasures,

880
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and they looked really happy and healthy,

881
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
in this remote forest,

882
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and then he went to the Buddha,

883
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and he was just smitten by this whole thing,

884
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
which was such an experience,

885
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
he was praising it,

886
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and it was in the end,

887
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
because, you know, they don't follow,

888
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
on account of any external observances,

889
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and they're certainly not happy,

890
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
on account of those things,

891
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
they follow,

892
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
because they understood the dharma,

893
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and you know,

894
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
well, you had children,

895
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
back in the day,

896
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
understanding the dharma,

897
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
obviously, that's quite unlikely today,

898
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
but it's still possible.

899
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So it's this understanding,

900
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
which can't be really measured externally,

901
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
certainly not,

902
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
by the measure of Patugina.

903
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So that's quite,

904
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think that's also a useful thing,

905
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
for somebody who knows that he's a Patugina,

906
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
and wants to practice to know,

907
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
because,

908
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
you won't become evicting then,

909
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
of sort of developing,

910
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
no, this is what's right,

911
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
this is what's wrong,

912
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and then convince yourself,

913
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
that you, as a Patugina,

914
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
know what right is,

915
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and what wrong is,

916
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
because if you were to know that,

917
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
you wouldn't be a Patugina.

918
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The description of Sotepan,

919
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I mean the Sotepan,

920
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
is he knows right,

921
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
as right,

922
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and wrong, as wrong.

923
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So if somebody who knows that he's not a Sotepan,

924
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
says, no, this is right,

925
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and believes that,

926
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
he's just blocking his own development.

927
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh, you hold that view now,

928
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and deep down you know,

929
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
actually, that you don't really know,

930
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and you certainly don't have a criteria.

931
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So you can't help by having a judgment.

932
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That's just a natural thing.

933
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's thinking is a form of judgment already.

934
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But what you can't help,

935
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
is not the other believes on account of your judgment,

936
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
especially when you know,

937
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
that you don't really know.

938
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So you do have your,

939
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
you can't help it,

940
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
but you make sure that you find

941
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
the right judgment,

942
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
the Samadhi,

943
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
the right view,

944
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and then you use that as a criteria,

945
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
or rather that becomes the criteria.

946
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You become that criteria.

947
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So I'm back to the room sitting in your room.

948
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What?

949
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Both of this.

950
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You sit in there.

951
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You want to practice then.

952
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But now you want to go downstairs to speak to people,

953
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
to distracts all the various distractions.

954
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You want to read a book and a novel.

955
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But you don't want to do it.

956
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You don't do it.

957
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So you're sitting there.

958
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's pain.

959
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The thing is all the possibilities

960
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
and the distractions you can go.

961
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That's all you have.

962
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's pain of boredom.

963
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's poor and essential.

964
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And so the best.

965
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So to be appraising right effort,

966
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
to be seen that,

967
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
seeing that that is the reason that boredom is there.

968
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And maybe investigating it.

969
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, the right effort would be basically not going.

970
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Not leaving the room.

971
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Not acting out of fear.

972
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That would be the right effort.

973
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
As to what you do on a more particular level,

974
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
it would be basically why.

975
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Ask yourself why is there a whole boredom?

976
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Not going out.

977
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Why is it a problem?

978
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Why is it unwanted?

979
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Why does it make you suffer?

980
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And then you realize that it's not about you staying in the room

981
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
or not staying in the room.

982
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's about you suffering.

983
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So you don't want to suffer.

984
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That's why you want to leave the room.

985
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That's why you're going to get distracted.

986
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And that is the core of dumb suffering.

987
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And freedom from it.

988
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So why do I don't want to be touched by the unpleasant feeling?

989
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Why by default I resist that.

990
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Why by default I act upon it.

991
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Why I take it for granted that I must run away from this feeling?

992
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
That's all you have to do.

993
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The tiny little thorn needs to be pulled out.

994
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Just a tiny little resistance to pain.

995
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You pull that out.

996
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You won't be touched by anything.

997
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
But you certainly won't be pulling anything out.

998
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
If you're running away whenever these things and pressure arises.

999
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
If you act upon distractions, leave the room, attempt to find duty food

1000
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and meaningful sort of things that end up being just distractions,

1001
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
or whatever.

1002
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
No, it's my duty to spread the dumb mind.

1003
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You know, do the public case, no.

1004
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Your duty is to become another hand.

1005
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And then whatever you do, or at least sort of another,

1006
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
then whatever you do will be coming out of the right view.

1007
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Even if externally people don't recognize it as such,

1008
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
that's not your concern.

1009
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
There is a major need for exiting there.

1010
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
If you're a pain.

1011
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
There's fearlessness in it.

1012
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Basically, the moment you stop feeling the pain,

1013
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
you can get up and leave if you want to do that.

1014
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Because you won't be rooted in anything out of fear.

1015
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So the Buddha wanted to sit down,

1016
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
but he made sure he removed the fear, and then he said that.

1017
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So you can't possibly not do anything for the rest of your life.

1018
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You just want to make sure that it's never ever rooted again in an awesome way.

1019
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Sometimes, there will be quickly remedied.

1020
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Sometimes you might just have to sit in the room and endure it for days.

1021
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But you know, that won't last forever either.

1022
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's all about taking for granted the resistance to unpleasant feeling.

1023
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That needs to be uprooted.

1024
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
That tiny little thing needs to be pulled out.

1025
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And then all the other past and infection on account of it will be gone.

1026
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Eventually it will.

1027
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Because it's not being infected anymore.

1028
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
By death.

1029
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Oh, that's healthy.

1030
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And the craving for the pleasant.

1031
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Well, they are the same.

1032
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You crave for pleasure.

1033
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Because basically not having enough of that pleasure is unpleasant.

1034
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So your whole life revolves around fear of pain.

1035
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And even people are going to subject themselves to pain.

1036
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Prove themselves that they are not afraid of pain.

1037
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
They need to prove themselves because underneath that they are afraid of pain.

1038
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So they try to override it.

1039
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But yeah, because if you're afraid of pain, then you might plot practicing the death.

1040
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You might have more reason for becoming a man called...

1041
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That is the reason.

1042
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That is the sole reason.

1043
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I am subject to suffering.

1044
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I am like when a layman reflects before he goes thought in the suitors.

1045
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I am prey to suffering.

1046
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Pray.

1047
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So I'm under.

1048
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Nothing got me.

1049
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yet.

1050
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But the fact that I feel like I'm prey to this suffering means the hunch is there.

1051
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Always.

1052
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And he might pounce at any moment.

1053
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So it doesn't necessarily pounce.

1054
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But you recognize that you are actually prey in this field when there are serious carnivores.

1055
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So even if they don't kill you, the fate that they might kill you, that is a suffering itself.

1056
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
That concern, that fear.

1057
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So again, I am subject to suffering.

1058
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Means I don't necessarily suffer.

1059
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
But I recognize that if suffering does land at some point, I am subjected to it.

1060
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I won't be able to prevent that.

1061
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I might be able to deal with it as an aftermath in hindsight.

1062
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I might be able to resolve it or whatever.

1063
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But the fact that he was touched in the first place, that is the problem.

1064
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
One and only.

1065
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's it.

1066
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And that's what he would have said.

1067
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The only thing he could possibly teach is suffering and freedom from it.

1068
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Because everything else is done because of that, whether people know it or not.

1069
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You pursue pleasure because not having enough of it is pun pleasant.

1070
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But then always you realize you never have enough of it.

1071
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But then you can pursue it more.

1072
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And it's just more and more unpleasure.

1073
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You run away from pain.

1074
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Why?

1075
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Because it's unpleasant.

1076
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
You're running away from pleasant.

1077
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Well, it is unpleasant.

1078
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah.

1079
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Because you avoided it temporarily.

1080
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And then it's like a temporary risk.

1081
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Means there is obviously no greater perspective than the wisdom.

1082
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Because scratching your itch, temporarily relieved you, but in the long run,

1083
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,000
making it much more infected and worse.

1084
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Some people would say that people are much more distracted nowadays,

1085
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
but you know, with funds or whatever internet.

1086
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Is it different time?

1087
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I think it's just that it's more proliferated, but the roots were the same.

1088
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The roots of distraction, they're rooted in the same things.

1089
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:06,000
So people today are more frivolous, probably more divorced from the nature of things

1090
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
because of that proliferation.

1091
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But then nature is still there, which means the roots of the distractions are still the same.

1092
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Well, if you want to get things going quick, you want to start to practice,

1093
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you want to see the truth and understand reality.

1094
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The precepts.

1095
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
The precepts are restraints.

1096
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And then we'll show you the fear quite quickly.

1097
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Put down your phone switch of the internet.

1098
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Put down your phone switch of the internet.

1099
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Well, try and preserve it, but do not try and keep it.

1100
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Don't eat like a pig.

1101
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Restrain yourself.

1102
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Basically, start practicing restraint in regard to your senses,

1103
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
and all these things will be revealed very quickly.

1104
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And then, have to be very careful.

1105
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Don't start holding a view.

1106
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I can't do that.

1107
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And view holding views on the counter is what I said.

1108
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Whereby, you know that you don't know,

1109
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
but you accept that what you're doing now is the right thing.

1110
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And then you develop a belief that this is the right thing to do.

1111
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But you still don't know for yourself that that's the right thing to do.

1112
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
That's why we really said that, you know,

1113
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
monks can live, we'd run from sensuality physically,

1114
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and then even mentally.

1115
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But then they end up arguing and debating and holding onto views.

1116
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And because of that, Mars still controls that.

1117
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
But again, one thing at a time.

1118
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You know, you can't be dealing with the views

1119
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
if your behavior is still under your strength.

1120
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So, with your strength behavior, don't pursue distractions.

1121
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And then, in view of the views for a while,

1122
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
and then they'll become apparent, and you'll know,

1123
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
then you basically, again, what I was saying,

1124
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
you stop rooting them in the end also.

1125
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Reviews.

1126
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Or you kind of help by having views.

1127
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So then you just want to know, make sure that you know that

1128
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
when you have views.

1129
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So you know that these are inevitable.

1130
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
The views are inevitable.

1131
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
But what I can't do is not hold them blindly

1132
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
to such an extent that I believe, even if it's about the sea

1133
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
like the Dharma, it's still not justification

1134
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
to hold the views in regard to it.

1135
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Because that's a...

1136
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah, abandoning views.

1137
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
There's a view that nothing pleases me.

1138
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Oh, yeah.

1139
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Nothing, yeah.

1140
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And that view pleases you.

1141
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, that's the view.

1142
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
That's what people say, oh, you don't hold 20 fixed views.

1143
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Well, that is a fixed view that you clearly hold on to.

1144
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So you don't hold the views,

1145
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
but recognizing the views are inevitable.

1146
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
That's already okay.

1147
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So you do have views, but you don't hold to them.

1148
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So that's what it's meant.

1149
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Doesn't mean like, don't hold the views like not actually

1150
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
have any views.

1151
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
That's impossible.

1152
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Even the right views are views.

1153
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
They just replaces the wrong views.

1154
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So that's the most you can...

1155
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Well, that's all you can do.

1156
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
That's all you need to do.

1157
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Just replace your wrong views with the right view

1158
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
and it will lead you to the other hand.

1159
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Your wrong attention with the right.

1160
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yeah, exactly.

1161
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Right, wrong attention.

1162
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But no, because they're all the attention.

1163
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'll never attend anything.

1164
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'll never do anything.

1165
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'll never leave this room for the rest of my life.

1166
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Because everything is bad.

1167
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
No, that's your attention.

1168
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Well, that's something you're clearly doing.

1169
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You're clearly intending.

1170
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You're clearly performing and you're fully not aware of.

1171
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But that view in that suit says,

1172
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I think it's in Magima 74.

1173
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Nothing pleases me.

1174
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
That first view.

1175
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That first view.

1176
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That first view.

1177
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1178
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Because you would...

1179
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You would basically...

1180
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Nothing pleases me.

1181
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You wouldn't commit to any other.

1182
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
More particular view.

1183
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But then, you know,

1184
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:52,000
there is that one that you need to deal with.

1185
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But yeah, I don't...

1186
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
No, I'm not obsessed with...

1187
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Existence.

1188
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Sorry?

1189
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Everything that is...

1190
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You know, pulled into it anymore.

1191
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

1192
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Because the only reason you were pulled into it

1193
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
was because you were acting out of fear of suffering.

1194
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You were prey to suffering

1195
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
and you were just doing what prey does, running.

1196
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So, you know, there might be a hunter behind this tree.

1197
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
If you don't know,

1198
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
but you just run.

1199
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And then, you know,

1200
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
when you know there's a child,

1201
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
you know, there's something...

1202
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You might feel something chasing you.

1203
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
There's a kid in the dark or whatever.

1204
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And then you start running out of fear to get quicker to your home.

1205
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But once you're given to running,

1206
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
then you become even more afraid.

1207
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And even if there's nothing chasing you,

1208
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
once you're given to running,

1209
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
you'll need to run even faster.

1210
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Because that's how it works.

1211
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's like an avalanche that you're responsible for.

1212
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
A flood. A floodgate.

1213
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It's open.
