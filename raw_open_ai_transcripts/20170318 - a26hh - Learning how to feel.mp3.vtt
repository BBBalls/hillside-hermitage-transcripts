WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Well, I'll start off with this one. The question is quite common. How to make sati continuous.

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
You know how to be mindful of the right thing continuously. You're speaking with yesterday.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah, well simple answer is by understanding what sati is. By abandoning the notion that sati

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
tends to do that momentary momentary moment to moment awareness or something and there's simply contradiction. It doesn't, you can't exist like that.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
But I'm interested in the sati which is in regard to freedom of suffering. Right? The relevant.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
Not sati to make my life better. Yeah. To make them more productive or smarter, more intelligent, more focused.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Well, not even, not necessarily just that, but even like even people who are into meditation techniques and so on.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
The idea of sati is that observing for a moment to a moment to a moment and then you have the uninterrupted mindfulness.

01:18.000 --> 01:31.000
But mindfulness is not structured moment to moment, structurally in a different heart after all of more general things, more general intentions,

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
more general states of mind basically whereby if you get established upon them, then the particular things,

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
the matter how fast, how fleeting they are occurring, your mindfulness is not effective by it.

01:47.000 --> 01:58.000
But if your mindfulness is established upon particular fleeting things, then your mindfulness will define the way with them as their cease.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
So in the relevant manner, basically, yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
Establishing your mind at a more general phenomenon.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
And it can be various things in terms of establishing a mindfulness upon them.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
So you don't have to, it's not like fixed, you must establish upon this. You can use your body, you can use your feelings, you can use your thoughts,

02:24.000 --> 02:35.000
you can use the motivations behind your actions, you can use those things to establish your mind in regard to things you're doing at a particular level and that's already mindfulness.

02:35.000 --> 02:44.000
So in terms of, if you want the most direct answer, how to be mindful, that's relevant to the suffering and feeling from it.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, you have to be mindful of your feelings or of the present feeling, whichever there is.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
And even with the feelings you can see, even they have this kind of hierarchy of more general and more ambiguous and so on.

02:59.000 --> 03:15.000
You know, because even the most kind of vague, the far above mood is always, basically, you can regard it almost as a feeling because it has a certain feel to it.

03:15.000 --> 03:25.000
Because you might not be able to define what you perceive in terms of that mood as a phenomenon, but you can certainly say, yeah, it feels a bit, it's a bit heavy, so okay, you're perceiving happiness.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
But all of those things you perceive, how do they feel? It's a bit unpleasant, so it's a bad mood.

03:31.000 --> 03:47.000
Or you can have the most obvious, oh, this is a very pleasurable feeling that's coming as a result of me having agreeable perceptions, such as nice taste, beautiful sights and so on.

03:47.000 --> 03:59.000
So if you're obviously, if you're only concerned with those things, then when those things change, when those things move too quickly, your mindfulness will not remain established because it was established upon that.

03:59.000 --> 04:11.000
But say you establish a mindfulness upon that general mood behind these particular things that are rising and sort of interacting with you.

04:11.000 --> 04:23.000
If you establish a mind upon those more general, general sense of, you know, yeah, my mind feels light and expanded, which is agreeable, which is pleasant.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
So you can then establish your mind upon that level of feeling, or rather than feeling on that level.

04:29.000 --> 04:41.000
And then when you do have disagreeable perceptions, they will not induce painful feelings because your mind is established on the higher feelings, being higher than those.

04:41.000 --> 04:52.000
And although those are like in the surface, similar, established your mind upon the perception of forest, so then disagreeable perception of the village when you have to be in the village will not bother you.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
And it's for that very reason.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
So you establish your mind on a higher feeling?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
On a more general feeling, yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
So you're saying I'm pleasant feeling to go to a higher feeling?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
You could, yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:28.000
Well, no, if a particular disagreeable feeling bothers you, yeah, you're going to higher feeling. And you know, the ultimate higher feeling is accepting that you will die, not being afraid of death.

05:28.000 --> 05:39.000
And then you realize, okay, so whatever has a reason, whatever arises, it will have to cease because it's not going to stay and beset me forever, which is impossible and conceivable.

05:39.000 --> 05:53.000
So then you don't even have to think that anymore when you've thought it's sufficient number of times, because then you just know that whatever has a reason has to cease, for whatever reason that it has a reason, nothing else, nothing other.

05:53.000 --> 06:07.000
So the whole idea of the, and that's what people fear pain. That's why everybody fears pain because when it arises, there is an implicit assumption that's eternal, that's going to last forever.

06:07.000 --> 06:25.000
So you just have that that kind of inside contains that inside fear that this pain that I know that I don't know and escape from, it's going to sort of affect me forever.

06:25.000 --> 06:44.000
Although your reason can tell you know, nothing lasts forever and so on, on that emotional level, you're locked in the assumption forever. And the same for pleasure, which is why, for a mind which is not developed, yeah, pleasure is overly intoxicating.

06:44.000 --> 07:03.000
After the point of oblivion and genuinely developing views, that yeah, you will endure and last forever. But if you start undermining that assumption, then when the pain arises, you won't feel it because you know that it's inconceivable for anything to last forever in that sense, in that emotional oppression sense.

07:03.000 --> 07:18.000
And in the same sense, your thirst for, for central pleasure is your pleasures that you can gain in regard to the world and so on. Well, that will also fade gradually because you realize, oh, that's not possible.

07:18.000 --> 07:34.000
Whatever, so why do I even bother? Why do you expose myself? It's just such a trifle sort of satisfaction in regard to it.

07:34.000 --> 07:50.000
So the mindfulness, establishing of mindfulness is basically establishing a mind on a more general level in regard to your present experience here as a whole.

07:50.000 --> 08:12.000
Because if it's not in regard to the present experience, then it just becomes an abstraction, whatever you're thinking. It just becomes divorced from what you're actually doing. But if you establish it presently and you're aware of its presence, so to speak, then then it becomes very real and obviously very functional establishment.

08:12.000 --> 08:24.000
Whereby anything lower than that establishment, anything less general, anything more particular, I will not cannot bother you, cannot affect you.

08:24.000 --> 08:32.000
That's why the Buddha said you should be taking this as far as necessary in order to develop final freedom.

08:32.000 --> 08:56.000
So then in that sort of dimension upon the perceptions of the forest, you've been perceptions of the village, then he recognizes, okay, so now when I go into the village, I'm not affected by any perceptions and I see they're agreeable or disagreeable because my mind is properly fully established upon the perceptions of the life experience as a whole in the forest.

08:56.000 --> 09:06.000
But he also recognizes the disturbances can still come on account of this perception in the forest. If something happens in the forest, I could lose my mindfulness.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
So then he takes itself further, then he establishes his mind upon the perceptions of earth.

09:12.000 --> 09:25.000
So then whether he's in the forest or even more lower in the village or even lower than that in a layman's house, crowded house, then he won't be affected because his mind is fully set, fully established upon the forest.

09:25.000 --> 09:45.000
So whatever he is on this earth, he'll be mindful presently. So theoretically he could lose that mindfulness of being established upon the perception of earth if he was to leave the earth, to fly into space or something.

09:45.000 --> 09:56.000
But if somebody is able to establish their mind to such a level of perception of earth, then they could easily establish it upon the perception of space, upon the perception of those general phenomena that pertain to the mind.

09:56.000 --> 10:05.000
So he would be fine even in space, basically. That's what I'm saying.

10:05.000 --> 10:16.000
So how do you make that perception of earth to not be abstract? You make it by discerning it in your present experience right here, right now, because it is then.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
But obviously in order to discern it, you need to know what it is, or at least you need to have some clue.

10:22.000 --> 10:30.000
And that's why it's important to basically learn and inform yourself from the sutras and pondering and discerning it as a phenomenon present.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
So only discern it in theory, because that's not a discernment, that's an abstraction.

10:36.000 --> 10:45.000
So there is a present thinking and there is the abstract thinking. And usually people can distinguish it too, and then they kind of disregard thinking altogether.

10:45.000 --> 10:59.000
But that's just a very bad idea, because if you think about solidity, an image is the kind of image of solidity.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah. Surrounding. A concept of gossip.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
But when with feelings.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
No, because feelings don't appear as concepts, because there will be a perception.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
There being felt, so you need to use the faculty of feeling to feel, basically.

11:21.000 --> 11:31.000
That's why I think again, my teaching is for the one who feels, basically, he's teaching is for the one who knows how to feel.

11:31.000 --> 11:42.000
So just sort of being liable to feeling, it's not enough, everybody is that they actually have to know to discern how to feel, and then you will know the feeling.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
Because most people think they perceive, most people think when they feel they actually perceive it.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah. When you say feeling, pleasant feeling.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, you're going to see, that's what you perceive.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
A concept of pleasant feeling.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
It's absolutely whatever.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
So I can designate a pleasant feeling, but that designation is on the level of perception.

12:03.000 --> 12:14.000
Perception of sound, perception of art, perception of even a perception of a mental image of either words, pleasant feeling, written, or some pleasant experience.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
So it's basically always perception, and you can't not have the perceptions.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
In a sense, you can't not have feelings, because they are inseparable, perception and feeling.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
But what you can know is how to feel in regard to that which you perceive.

12:32.000 --> 12:40.000
And not think that that which you perceive is the same thing that you're feeling, because then there will be a perception.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
So simultaneously, while you're perceiving, you're always simultaneously that feeling on a level of feeling.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
And those two levels cannot make, they cannot come together, they cannot communicate.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
They're actually, like, blind to each other.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Your feelings don't know about your perceptions.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
No, your perceptions know about your feelings.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
It's your assumption that it's the same, that it's different, that it's both same and different.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It's not the same, the different in regard to perception and feeling.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
You mix it a lot, and then you assume, and then what you perceive is what you feel, what you feel is what you perceive.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
But feeling feels perception perceives, and that's it.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
And whether that thing is same, or different, or neither of both, it doesn't matter.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
But one is more general than you.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
No, no, they'll see, if you would say one is more general than the other, then they'll be comparable.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
And being comparable is only the form of relationship, and I said, they're completely unaware of each other.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
And because feeling is completely unaware of perception and perception is completely unaware of feeling,

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
you can, you can, you can free both of them from assumptions and from the sense of self and everything.

13:46.000 --> 13:57.000
Because if there were relationship, then there would be the agent in control of them, in regard to them, external to them, internal to them, whichever way.

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
What about this, like, joy, joy, and one gets from it to, what, pity, pity?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Uh-huh.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
So, maybe we spoke about, to will, to will that, to get that going.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Uh-huh.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And one can do that.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
One can generate pity.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Well, pity, partly pity.

14:23.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah, pity, yeah. And a joy, one can generally enjoy, as an acts of will.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Mm-hmm.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
Obviously, if you, your mind is very depressed or something, scattered, unrestrained, that would have much practice.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
But you could, some say, to do that.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And that feels good.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
And that way, it seems like I'm in control.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Well, no.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.000
No, no. You think you would be in control if you then appropriate that good feeling.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
That good feeling is just the result of the search of way of attending and intending.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
And that's absolutely fine.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Mm-hmm.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
That's why you shouldn't fear that pleasure.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
When the Buddha said the pleasure in regard to Johnus and so on.

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
He realized, hold on, I don't actually have to, because initially he was disregarding all of the pleasure.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Any pleasant feeling was bad.

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
But then, when he started developing Johnus, he realized, no, actually, these feelings are not underlined by any of those unwholesome things.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
There is no reason to fear this.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
On the contrary, I should cultivate this.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
Hence, he was declared as the ultimate way of basically getting in the right view, developing Johnus,

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
and then you'll be fully developed on both ways, are they say?

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Through full understanding and through full development in regard to your body and meditation.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
Because, yeah, it's that good, or rather, it can be that good.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Wherever you can intentionally call it with the right view, no, without the right view.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
But with the right view, intentionally cultivate joy or a rapture or whatever,

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
and it won't be an also, because you would know it if it's unwholesome.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Because you're just intending.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
It's just the result of the intention that's occurring.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Not yours to begin with.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It's not in regard to your body.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
No, no, no, no.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It doesn't pertain to the senses.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
That's why it's not unwholesome.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
However, obviously, you can appropriate that joy, which is why Kutugin and Ken developed Johnus.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Obviously, he abandoned lots of central cravings as a result of it,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
because this is much more supply and much more refined.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
But, yes, you could.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
That's what I mean.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
You wouldn't be doing it rightly.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
If you then start appropriating that joy and feeling you are in control of that joy,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
this joy is mine.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
But with the right view, that wouldn't happen.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
So then you would just have the proper practice of developing joy

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
and the right view that sort of sees through any occurrence of lust, aversion, and delusion.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
So it wouldn't be before long that the mind would be completely free from all the hindrances.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
With that development.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
Because there wouldn't be any agitation, there wouldn't be any anxiety.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
Even hardships would feel relatively lazy, because the mind gets elevated.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
The hindrances won't come up again.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Yes, I say you become an arrogant.

17:27.000 --> 17:45.000
Yes, you become an arrogant.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
You don't want to say feeling is always in the background.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I see what you mean.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
And you can, well, I think initially you probably have to, because that's where you're going to find it,

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
because the mind is not too used to much establish the contraception.

18:05.000 --> 18:14.000
And obviously, mind needs to learn how to feel, how to discern feeling among the things that it perceives.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
So yeah, and that's the entity in the background.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
You won't find it where you perceive it.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
You'll find it simultaneously in regards to that which you perceive.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
Basically, you have to refrain from attending to the feeling as if it's a perception.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
So you have to refrain from attending to the feeling as if you will see it.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
It's not actually behind.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
It's right there all the time in regard to whatever you perceive it to.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
And obviously, it has its own, well, its domain has its own laws, so to speak.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
So it's not as diverse as perception.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
It's always quickly perception, but obviously it's much more subtle than perception.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Beyond perception.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Well, well, it's beyond in terms of it is nothing to do.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
They're not to the same place, so to speak.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
While in place is there will already be applicable on the perception.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Comes as a result of perception.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Space in place.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Feeling is in regard to it.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
So it's just like two dimensions that you just used to learn.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
But the other one is constantly in regard to it.

19:20.000 --> 19:26.000
It's how the unconditioned.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Well, it will be.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
When you completely let go of it.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
That's why the teaching is for the one who feels,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
and that's why he teaches only suffering and freedom from it.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
And that's it.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
That's the whole dharma in there.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
It's only boundless pleasant, because nothing felt.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Or rather, no feeling can touch you.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Thus, you don't feel it.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
You don't feel anything.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
And that's the extreme.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Like, peace.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
So are you going to always see the distinction?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
No, he won't see it.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
He'll feel it.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
No, he'll feel it.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
He'll feel it.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
He'll feel the feeling, and he'll see it from the point of view of perception.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Or rather, he'll, we won't try to see his feeling.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
Or will he try to feel these perceptions?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
He'll feel, he'll perceive.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Or rather, feeling will feel, perception will perceive.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Intentions will intend.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
So you can attend to a feeling, isn't it?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Yes.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
But see, in order to attend to a feeling, you have to, well,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
you have to use the proper attention.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Because if you don't know how to attend to the feeling,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
well, you attend by the means that you're used to,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
and those are the means of perception,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
you won't be attending to the feeling.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
You still feel it.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Because feeling is an aggregates.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You can't not feel it.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
You just, you won't be able to discern what feeling is.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
You won't be able to know the feeling until you learn how to feel.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
So feeling in itself is not enough for you to learn how to feel.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Feeling and just affects you.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Just hits you.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Good and bad when you try.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So by learning how to feel then,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
you can eventually transcend the whole,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
the whole domain of feeling.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And a lot of demands are missing.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
It's not hard to pay attention.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It's not hard to feel.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
It's not hard to feel.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
But I couldn't say that at any given time of your experience

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
is how the feeling is present there.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So if I ask you now,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
and that's the thing,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
you can discern how to feel because there is

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
an implicit knowledge of the feeling.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Or a degree of recognition.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Maybe it's not to the level of knowledge, but certainly.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
If you ask me how do I feel?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, if I ask you how do you feel now,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
you would be able to answer.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Even if you say,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
well, I don't quite know.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
It means, okay.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
So you feel like there is no like that,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
which means you feel kind of beautiful.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Wearing towards unpleasant,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
because you don't really know it.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
So you're bored or whatever.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
You know.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
But they're not ready to answer.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Even some sort of these words describe that.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Sure.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Sure.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
But that doesn't still necessarily mean

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
that you have confused the two.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
That you've started.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Or rather, you can describe the feeling

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
in terms of designation, terms of perception.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
But you won't assume that that perception stands for that,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
which you feel at the time when you're describing it.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
And that's why you can be mindful of the feeling

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
or feelings as they arise respectively.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
At any time, at any place in any situation,

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
because they're not directly linked to the actual,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
like particular sort of perceptions and so on.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
They arise as a whole.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Perception, feeling and intention arise together,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
cease together.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
So you can,

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
when there is a disagreeable perception or whatever,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
that has a reason, for untrained mind,

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
they're most likely going to be unpleasant feelings as well.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
But that doesn't necessarily have to be the case.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And because it doesn't have to be the case,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
freedom from disagreeable perceptions

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
in terms of suffering is possible.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Because if perception perceives and feeling feels,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
there's nothing to do with you.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
It's a free of the disagreeable perception.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Disagreeable perceptions for protusion mean suffering,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
meaning feeling pain, feeling unpleasant.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Because that mix,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
or rather that mixing up,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
that that wrong assumption in regard to perception

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
and feeling feeling perception,

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
that I will think,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
it's so hardened that now is the solid thing.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
So for him, disagreeable means pain.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Disagreeable perceptions,

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
discomfort,

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
and in any of that kind of means emotional pain.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
So he needs to kind of,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
unravelled,

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
the whole thing,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
the whole assumption,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
and then start doing exactly that.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Because if you can see the difference,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
and all the difference between perception and feeling,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
that's almost, that's John.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Well, if you get established in that,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
it would be.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
So if you can perceive,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
or rather,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
if your experience can let the perceptions

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
perceive in feelings feel,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
you become redundant.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And that's John.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
My sense of self becomes redundant,

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
and disappears.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Temporarily,

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
based on the intention of that establishment,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
upon that establishment,

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
but with the right view,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
that's all it takes.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Then the view of the self will disappear,

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
the views of the conceit,

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
will disappear and so on,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
and then yeah,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
you will be in a random.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Because perception perceives, feeling feels,

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
intention intends.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
So this sense of self now,

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
the link is in regard,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
and kind of hovers over these things,

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
you realize, well,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
that's just another perception, isn't it?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
The perceives,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
there's feeling in regard to it,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
that feels,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
and intention in regard to it,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
that intends.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Then the subtler sense of why I'm in regard to that,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
oh, well, the fact that I was just able to designate,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
it means that's another perception that perceives,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
that has a feeling that in regard to it,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
it feels, and intention that intends.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
And you can push this infinitely,

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
until you get tired,

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
and you realize, oh,

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
this whole idea,

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
this whole notion,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
this whole concept of,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
I am lingering,

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
is just a more subtle perception,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
in regard to the original perception,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
it's a more subtle feeling,

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
in regard to the original feeling,

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
it's a more subtle intention,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
in regard to the original intention.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
That's all you're going to have,

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
is feel, perception, intention.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
And when you,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
kind of drill that,

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
long enough,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
and in notion of me,

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
and I am,

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
it just fades, evaporates,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
like heating a pan

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
that has water in it.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
You know,

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
if there's a lot of water,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
you might have to heat it longer,

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
but eventually,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
everything will evaporate,

26:03.000 --> 26:27.000
and then you can stop heating it.

26:27.000 --> 26:40.000
Here's the heart of St. John, of course.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
By knowing what John is,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
by not mixing your feelings

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
with your perceptions,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
by learning how to feel,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
but be mindful of your feelings.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
All of those things

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
can become basis for your John.

26:53.000 --> 27:14.000
So, the one state of mind that,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I can see that,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I did most of my things in my life

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
was because of boredom,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
most things I did.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Again, you've all this,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
since you've had it,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
you've all been drinking smoking,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
all business watching movies,

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
and boredom.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
I think the most people get,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
yeah, that's the,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
boredom and fear of boredom.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Fear of boredom.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Like genuine fear of boredom.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
You know, I'm bored,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
but you actually,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
everybody, what?

27:51.000 --> 27:57.000
Fear of boredom.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Because when you do get extremely,

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
extremely boredom,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
that's extremely, extremely boredom.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Well, then you start losing,

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
losing your sense of self,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
which is obviously for somebody

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
who is all about their sense of self,

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
it's very frightening.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
So, that's why boredom freak people out,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
because you can lose your sense of self,

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
not in there.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Well, not losing in terms of,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
fully extinguished,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
as another hand,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
but basically start feeling,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
like you're not letting go of the sense of self,

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
yet it's being taken away.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Oh, but how is it taking away that?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Well, it's taken away through boredom,

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
basically simply because boredom is unpleasant,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
or rather, you've been pursuing,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
everybody's been pursuing pleasures,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
habitually,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and now they became dependent upon the pursuit of pleasures.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Thus, when there are no pleasures,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
even if there is no particular pain,

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
so it's just boredom,

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
it's just a neutral feeling,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
but because you're so dependent upon pleasures,

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
that neutral feeling starts to feel very unpleasant.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
And not knowing this cave from unpleasant,

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
you fear it even more,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
you're affected by it even more.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
So, basically, the whole thing of boredom

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
just shows you that deep down,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
inside of your very sense of self

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
that you hold very dearly,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
you're not in control,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
even of that.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And that freaks you out.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
That's a solitary confinement,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
before I think I'm mad.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
And when they come out, they're like,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
oh, it's a different person now.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Yeah, you would be.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Obviously, you know,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
for somebody with the right view,

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
solitary confinement would probably result in arranging.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
But for those with the other right view,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
even coming across Nibbana,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
it would freak them out,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
as they did in the soup,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
and they would understand the goal of Dama

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
and the Buddha,

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
or the Buddha was pointing at us off,

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
they would annihilate us,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
they would kill us, they would destroy us.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Because they, their mind,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
their attention is still very rooted

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
in that completely gratuitously assumed sense of self,

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
but that is real a search,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
and that's all they have at a time.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
So that's why,

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
if in that state of mind,

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
they come across anything they will vaguely indicate,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
they are not in control,

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
they would be quite a good cause for anxiety,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
for a deep anxiety.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
And then if you stay with a deep anxiety longer,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
in the case of prolonged boredom,

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
you start freaking out,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
or you start looking for the way out.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Not everybody would freak out,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
some people would say,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
okay, I'm going to look,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
there is a freedom from this,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
because I'm not in control of my own very self.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
Now when I say I'm not in control,

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
I can do anything,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
which is something people end up doing after prolonged boredom.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
But means basically,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
you have no say,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
in the very foundations of your own being,

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
that you take to be yours.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Thus, that's a big contradiction.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
If it's mine,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
well, you would have a say,

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
but you have no say.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
So how can it be yours?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
But you don't know anything,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
but to have it as yours.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
But now everything is indicating

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
you that it can't be yours.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
So you have a choice.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
If you're able to,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
you can then just turn a blind eye

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
and run even faster

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
from the fact that you have no say in it.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
And always kind of be just just sort of enough,

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
like, you know,

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
basically you're drowning,

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
but you're just enough space

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
to have like a breath of air,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
every now and then.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And that's what most people lives are,

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
constant pursuit,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
because it's not,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I mean, the types of pursuit

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
are optional.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
But the reasons for the pursuit

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
for people are they are not optional.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
They don't have to do it,

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
because if you don't do it,

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
you start thinking.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
And where do you think?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
You think in the,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
in the basically in the environment

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
that shows you that things

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
are indifferent to you,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
you have no say,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
in your own feelings,

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
in your own intentions,

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
in your own perceptions,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
yet you're taken to be yours.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
That feels basically you're like,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
in a locked, in a car,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
in a vehicle,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
that it's running down the hill,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
full speed,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and actually the steering wheel

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
is not working,

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
maybe a little bit,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
but not in a sense

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
that you can stop the car.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
You turn around.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
It's a basic road,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
you can choose the way you're going to crash.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
But even that,

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
it's not ultimately not to you,

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
because you might crash

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
even before you reach

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
where you want to crash it.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
So you have,

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
you have a limited degree of control

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
within the ultimate lack of control.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
And where it sounds like suicide is,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
like the acts of suicide,

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
you can,

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
you don't really

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
try to do so.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Well, that's what I'm going to say,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
if you can only kind of

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
aim at the body

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
and then wait for death to come,

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
to come.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
And that's,

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
that's,

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
that's,

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
well, that's,

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
that's basically,

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
and even that,

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
it's not,

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
even that death

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
that comes cannot be yours.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Any more than any other things

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
that you could do during your life

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
can be yours.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
So one alternative

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
is to keep running away

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
from the alternative

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
is to then recognize

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
that this,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
it's not a good deal.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
And the contradiction

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
that your resistance is.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
So I'm,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
here, I am,

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
I feel things in mind,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
but I'm not saying it.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
So then I bet,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I better make the effort

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
and abandon the notion of

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
I am,

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
and things in mind.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
So then I won't,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I won't be having to live

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
this contradiction,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
which is actually unpleasant.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
So being at the bottom

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
of extreme boredom

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
there is nothing for you

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
to do,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
there's nothing for you to have.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Well, there never was.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
There never was,

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
there never was.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
There's what it is important.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
It feels,

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
I,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
yeah.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
Nonactivity.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Abiding in nonactivity.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
But we see, obviously,

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
boredom as a designation,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
it's already defined by

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
two genus,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
and it has a very negative

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
connotation, boredom.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
And see,

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
it has a negative connotation,

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
but it also implies

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
quite some,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
quite some self-deception

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
as well.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Guys, I am bored.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
It's kind of,

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
it's kind of all right,

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
but I don't like to be bored,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
but actually boredom is quite serious,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
because you might kind of

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
this try to dismiss you

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
by saying,

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
ah, it's boredom,

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
you just bored.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Leaving boredom

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
a bit longer,

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
and then you'll see,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
here's that falling apart.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Everybody is falling apart.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
What?

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Two genus is falling apart.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Yeah.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
But more accurately,

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
it's a neutral feeling

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
that obviously for

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
a general, it's not known,

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
it's not understood,

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
it's being feared,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
it's boredom.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
It's insinuct,

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
it's wherever else

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
that comes out of it.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
But if you actually

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
recognize it as such,

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
say,

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
recognize it in regard to,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
like,

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
low-lear feelings

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
of,

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
of sensual pleasure

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
and sensual discomfort

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
and so on,

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
then you,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
you actually know

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
this is peaceful,

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
this is more sublime.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
It's,

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
it's peaceful,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
it's neutral.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
And it's quite pleasant.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
In order to find

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
a pleasant,

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
you need to elevate your mind

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
to that level.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
You need to train

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
in regard to it.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Because the mind starts

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
down in the gutter,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
always,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
just a different extent.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
And then you have to work

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
your way up.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Yeah,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
we're,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
we're,

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
we're in somebody's

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
bored,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
negative sense of boredom.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
The mind starts to,

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
yeah,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
you can't,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and you start craving,

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
even craving those

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
old sentences.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Because basically,

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
that office itself,

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
but that,

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
you spoke before,

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
the sensual pleasure,

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
kind of feels like a,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
like a quick fix,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
whereby,

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
not just that you,

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
not just that you get the

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
pleasure of the sense

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
that you're engaging in,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
but you also get the pleasure

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
of just kind of avoiding

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
this boring pain,

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
this heavy,

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
anxious threat.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Behind this boredom.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
So the pleasure,

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
makes that disappear,

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
seemingly,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
improvise you with a pleasure

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
on top of it.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
So it's like a double whammy.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
But,

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
yeah,

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
the issue,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
if you don't go

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
into sensual pleasures,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
you just crave for them.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Is this

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
double the suffering

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
right there, you know?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Because you're not,

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
you know,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
you're bored.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Initially,

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
absolutely craving.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Yeah.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
So you crave.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
So,

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
so you suffer on a kind of

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
boredom,

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
because you're ignorant

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
in regard to it,

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
and then you suffer on a kind of

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
uncontrollable craving,

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
that you are not,

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
kind of, covering up

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
through giving in to that craving.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
So you have a double,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
double suffering that has been present,

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
and that's exactly how it is.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
It has to be in the beginning.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
That's why,

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Vinaya,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
the Sila,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
has to come first.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
The restraint,

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
the presets,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
has to come first.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
It's not a dharma,

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
but there wouldn't be any dharma

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
without it.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
So it has to come first,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
and then you can start building

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
within that.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Vinaya,

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
you can see craving.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
It's ugly.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Craving,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
equals suffering.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
You were craving

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
for this boredom to be

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
absent,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
to be not present.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
You were craving for pleasure

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
to be present.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
You have craving

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
on both levels.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
You have suffering on both levels.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
And you don't suffer,

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
actually.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
You don't suffer

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
because you're not pursuing

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
your desires.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
It's that non-pursuitive desires

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
shows you the craving

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
behind them,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
which is why you suffer.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
But it takes time to discern that,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
because craving,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
you give in,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
you go after a desire,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
and pain disappears.

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
Or so it seems.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Well, the pain disappears

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
because you stop craving.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
And you stop craving

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
because you have the assumption

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
that you've satisfied your desire.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
But the assumption

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
is nothing to do with the actual

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
satisfaction of your senses

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
or not.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
It's just an assumption,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
which is why next time,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
you probably need more of it.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
And more of it.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
And harder scratch.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
And harder push

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
and so on.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
And for what?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
For the same assumption of,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
okay, now I'm fine.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
But we might feel

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
at ease temporarily.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
So craving disappears.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
And then suffering disappears.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
But you think suffering disappears

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
because you said this

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
when you desire.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
But you didn't,

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
because when craving comes back,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
and it always comes back,

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
because it's not distinguished,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
suffering appears.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
And then again,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
you don't blame the craving

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
for that suffering,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
you blame,

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
oh, it's a new desire

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
and you need to satisfy.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
But it's actually,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
if there is a presence of craving,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
means suffering is present.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
You cannot suffer,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
on any other account,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
except one single account,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
presence of craving.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
In regard to the most extreme circumstances,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
the most extreme discomfort,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
situations, experiences,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
if there is suffering present,

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
it's not because of them.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It's because of the presence of craving

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
in regard to those circumstances.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
So that's why people are

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
restrained for people in Spain.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And they think,

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I'm hurting now,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
because I'm holding myself back.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I'm hurting because I'm restrained.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
No,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
it's not,

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
it basically restrained

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
is a sighting whereby,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
if you engage in restraint,

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
what is revealed

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
is that craving

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
is suffering.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Nothing else.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
But in order to see that,

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
you have to stop,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
you have to practice restraints efficiently

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
for you to know

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
that you should stop blaming it

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
for pain.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Stop assuming that

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
is the reason for your pain.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Yeah.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Yeah.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
So the sensuality

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
in itself

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
is inseparable from craving.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
So the perceptions of sensuality

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
are inseparable from craving.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
They imply craving.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Thus,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
you're perceiving

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
sensual desire,

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
means craving is present,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
means suffering is present.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Now, you restraining yourself

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
in regard to the pursuit

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
of the sensual desire,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
pain arises immediately

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
through saying no to yourself.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
But that pain is not because you said no.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
That pain is because,

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
saying no to yourself

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
revealed the underlying setup

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
of presence of craving

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
is very painful.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
And that pain,

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
how can you deal with it?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Either by extinguishing craving,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
which is for most people,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
well, impossible.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
They simply don't know

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
how

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
have not been instructed,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
have not heard it,

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
they have no concept of it.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
So the only way,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
like, it's not really escape,

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
but the only way

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
they could approximate

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
escape would be given in.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
And then again,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
happens exactly what I said before.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Oh,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
not just that you

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
kind of obscured

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
the pain that has arisen,

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
but now you also

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
got the pleasure of the senses.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
So you kind of feel

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
although it is good.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah, I avoided the pain

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
and I got pleasure as a result

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
through it.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Well, that's,

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
you can't ask for more.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
But the problem is,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
the underlying setup

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
of presence of craving,

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
presence of suffering,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
not just that he hasn't been

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
affected or resolved,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
he just has been fortified more.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
So the more you

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
pursue desires,

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
the more you crave,

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
which means the more

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
the more the craving is present,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
the more the suffering is present.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Hence the similarly

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
of scratching the edge,

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
you get that relief

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
temporarily while you're scratching it,

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
overall you're making it

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
much, much worse.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Next time it's

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
scratch harder,

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
and harder,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
and harder,

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
until eventually,

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
you're just like a

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
mangy doll

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
that's not even aware of it,

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
but it's perpetually,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
perpetually just scratching

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
and wrapping its skin open.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
It doesn't even know it anymore,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
it's just doing it as I have it,

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
it's just scratch,

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
it's just,

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
mind is elsewhere,

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
and he's just ripping it,

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
just scratching it.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
And that's,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
you know, quite, quite, quite formally,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
human existence.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Expect a burden in this.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
It feels like,

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
yeah, he's done,

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
isn't it?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Yeah.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
When there's nothing to

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
be happening.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
You feel like,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
you feel like you're

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
being annihilated.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Gradually.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Let me quote a pleasant thing,

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
isn't it?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Once you start having it.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
If you're not holding on

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
to the contradiction of

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
I am,

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
while that I am

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
being annihilated,

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
that's a discrepancy.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
So you avoid,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
you overcome that discrepancy,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
well,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
by basically not holding

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
on to I am anymore.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
So then there won't be any discrepancy.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Splitting,

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
hurting you,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
annihilating you.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Scroplism.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
We're here.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
It's deliberation.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Okay, that's okay.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
As a,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
in a monastic life.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Let me just give some practice

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
to cross,

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
they're calling me.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
You know what I'm doing?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I better turn my back.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Nice.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Go on, sorry.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah, in monastic life.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
You come and crop well.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I came across a plot anyway.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
What ethics do you embody?

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
And then just constant thoughts of,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
you're dying.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
And then ideas of how to survive.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Try, you know,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
you might go back to the past.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Try to rekindle yourself.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
We try to rekindle yourself.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
We can't do this.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Yeah.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
What about this?

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Don't, you know,

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
don't lose yourself.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Kind of.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
That desperate.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Yeah, there's desperation.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
To survive.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Yeah.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Or that's self.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
All of our things around the memories,

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
around the thoughts,

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
there were dear,

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
there were significant,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
through the sense of self.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Because if I had to be bored,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I'm sure that we can't be in,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
that desperate,

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
attempt to survive.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
But being able to watch,

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
be able to be.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Being able to not act out of it.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
To not.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
Well, to not act out of fear of boredom.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Not act out of fear.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
We'll stop.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
So to allow that boredom and that fear to arise.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Yeah.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
And just sit through it.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Kind of watch it.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Yeah.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
If something happens,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
then there's nothing to do

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
with your intention to run away from it.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
But if something happens,

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
I'm just watching a mosquito trying to enter through the curtain.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Yeah, sure.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
If something happens,

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
while you're being bored.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
But if that happens,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
if another is out of you,

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
trying to run away,

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
trying to, you know,

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
cover up the boredom,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
that's fine.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Well, long be fine,

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
is hoping for something to happen.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Well, long be fine,

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
is rejecting that which happened

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
because you must be bored.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Yeah.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
But that all comes

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
through training in boredom.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
You'll be able to start discerning it.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Turn on the distraction.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Through restraint.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Through restraint.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Yes.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
And then it will come.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
And the more it comes,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
the more proficient it is to become.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
The more proficient it is,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
the more it is better you see it.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
And then, oh,

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
this is training in peace.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
With some of this, yeah.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
Some of this is not doing anything just sitting around.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
It doesn't mess it, doesn't it?

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Well, externally,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
they might be just sitting around internally.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
They are probably doing a lot of wrong things.

46:39.000 --> 46:48.000
For wrong reasons.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Here is the mind,

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
this goes off into all sorts of directions.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
And usually when you sit down,

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
they are not doing anything,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
they tend to them not doing work.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
But they are sitting around,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
they are doing things they want to do,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
which means they are not necessarily bored.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
They are sitting around.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Well, nobody likes boredom.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Well, I don't like it.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I don't like boredom.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
So, I don't want to appreciate it,

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
because you can make me do that.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
I put a gym in the field, is it?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Because you can kill him.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
Well, because he doesn't know how to let go of his head

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
himself,

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
and that creates a rather unbearable discrepancy.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
And all into this,

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
which now,

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
it's kind of obvious,

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
cannot be mine yet,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I cannot not hold onto it.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
So, it really feels like you're being kind of,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
a coach on the inside.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
And yet, people lose their minds often.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
And I can't hold it.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Just get depressed.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
We'll get rid of it in the first, yeah.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Catatonic nap.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Yeah.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Because it always seemed like something was wrong,

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
isn't it?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
We let that boredom make it wrong.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
That's again,

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
there's just a view coming from the point of view of sense itself,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
so it's used to.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Yeah.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Instead of doing that,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
all those, those, those,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
kind of collector reviews

48:12.000 --> 48:39.000
would also start fading.
