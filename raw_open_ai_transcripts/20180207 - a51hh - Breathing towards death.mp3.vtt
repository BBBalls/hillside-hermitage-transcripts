WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.440
So it's sort of a few things down above my points, what I'm reading.

00:11.440 --> 00:20.240
So composure as a result of mine for reading, that's what I'm looking for, that's what I'm

00:20.240 --> 00:22.240
trying to do.

00:22.240 --> 00:28.440
Okay, while you're ready, you'll need to say straight, what composure is a result, can be

00:28.440 --> 00:33.960
a result, or rather the right composure is the result of this passion.

00:33.960 --> 00:40.480
This enchantment, neither the disgust towards the world, towards the senses, central pleasures,

00:40.480 --> 00:42.720
that's the composure you want.

00:42.720 --> 00:49.600
You don't want some sort of contemporary concentration, technique or something like that.

00:49.600 --> 00:55.040
You want composure based on this passion, based on turning away from the desires towards

00:55.040 --> 00:57.400
the world.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.160
Mine for me is the death provides you with that.

01:00.160 --> 01:08.760
But as it was the case in the suitors, it's a bit bloody keep us some people over the edge.

01:08.760 --> 01:14.440
So then the alternative, I eat the same thing.

01:14.440 --> 01:18.840
Just in a form of mindfulness of reading, just in a form of a less personal approach.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.840
Yes, of course.

01:20.840 --> 01:25.720
Well, yeah, in mindfulness of death, you begin, I am basically subject to death and this

01:25.720 --> 01:30.120
is disgusting, the body and the mind, thinking through your point of view.

01:30.120 --> 01:35.200
Mindfulness of breathing, you take the breathing as a point of view, not yourself.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.840
And then you are, I'm breathing like this, I'm breathing like that.

01:37.840 --> 01:42.960
But basically, the fact that the Buddha offered it instead of Maramanosate means it's

01:42.960 --> 01:43.960
that thing.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.040
It's pertains to that thing.

01:46.040 --> 01:51.600
So if you do mindfulness of reading rightly, you are basically contemplating death rightly,

01:51.600 --> 01:56.360
and you are experiencing this fashion towards the world rightly.

01:56.360 --> 02:02.800
You say to our checker, suitors, you are teaching a super meditation.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.800
Oh, yeah, it was a super, wasn't it?

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
Yeah, it was a super, wasn't it?

02:05.800 --> 02:06.800
Yeah, it was a super, I think.

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
Yeah, I think so.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.800
Yeah.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.800
Death.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.800
Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.560
Basically, the super and death kind of just discussed.

02:14.560 --> 02:19.200
But as I said, it comes to me and this body and I am.

02:19.200 --> 02:24.600
So if done rightly, if the Buddha said this, you are through to no time, full dispersion

02:24.600 --> 02:25.600
right away.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.120
But some people might get a bit too much and then don't think about it, better off without

02:30.120 --> 02:31.120
his body.

02:31.120 --> 02:36.120
And then they were jumping off the cliffs and asking those other, that crazy man to kill

02:36.120 --> 02:39.160
them with a sword and some of them.

02:39.160 --> 02:46.360
Yeah, I was going to say that's what the end goal of the mind from the breathing, that

02:46.360 --> 02:49.720
attached to the quantumist's mind for dissonance.

02:49.720 --> 02:58.920
All of that is basically rooted or sprints from correct dispassion, like you feel no desire

02:58.920 --> 03:02.600
to lose a world, to lose life.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.880
And also, you don't feel any desire to a death either.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.880
Why is it?

03:08.880 --> 03:15.600
Well, because death is the sort of, well, the notion of death requires the basis, the notion

03:15.600 --> 03:17.520
of life that you have.

03:17.520 --> 03:22.920
So that's when people, when people are involved with the life, that's when they want death.

03:22.920 --> 03:31.200
When their life sort of doesn't go their way, or goes, or it's actually unpleasant, then

03:31.200 --> 03:32.200
they want death.

03:32.200 --> 03:37.160
With the same desire, they are wanting life, now they want the ending of life.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.840
But when you feel dispassion towards their life, you feel dispassion towards, you don't

03:40.840 --> 03:44.400
care whether their life is there or not, thus you don't care whether you are alive or

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
not.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400
But possibly, be desiring death either.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.640
That's why would you be dispassion towards life?

03:49.640 --> 03:50.640
Sorry?

03:50.640 --> 03:57.840
Why would you be anxious in terms of, you know, because that's, what?

03:57.840 --> 04:01.920
What way do you see that you watch the breath and you become dispassionate towards life,

04:01.920 --> 04:02.920
you know?

04:02.920 --> 04:03.920
You see the topologies.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.320
So you mean, how will breath make you dispassionate towards life?

04:07.320 --> 04:08.320
Nothing.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.320
Yeah.

04:09.320 --> 04:15.160
Well, by understanding that your life can end in any next scene breath or not breath, without

04:15.160 --> 04:16.160
your control.

04:16.160 --> 04:23.160
So you actually have to take that idea of, you have to think about the breath, you can't

04:23.160 --> 04:24.160
just be watching it.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
Oh, yeah, of course.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.160
Yes, we think it will be going on here.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.000
I mean, I said millions of times before, I'm not talking about modern repassionate techniques

04:33.000 --> 04:36.160
of Burmese or what, not, or even what people see in life unless you're breathing it.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.160
I think.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.160
Not at all.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.160
That's all nonsense.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.160
You really assert this.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.280
And because it was quite clear how you do the breathing.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.920
You're breathing like this, you're breathing like this.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.440
So basically, you're actively involving your volition in the way how you breathe, while

04:48.440 --> 04:49.960
you're being mindful of that breath.

04:49.960 --> 04:50.960
Why?

04:50.960 --> 04:58.920
Because if you do that steadily enough, it will reveal that no amount of volition can cross

04:58.920 --> 05:05.360
that threshold after which the breath becomes in your control or rather the life that is

05:05.360 --> 05:09.960
provided by the breath becomes in your control.

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
That's impossible.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.240
You can only control the manner of your breathing, but the way that your life depends upon

05:15.240 --> 05:18.320
your breath, that's completely inconceivable for you.

05:18.320 --> 05:22.520
To control, to access, to have any input on you, you could just be breathing.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.600
You know, you've got the, you've got control of the, it's control of the intention to

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
breathe in a particular way.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.800
Yeah, but you don't have control over the way your body.

05:31.800 --> 05:36.240
Or it's like the normal amount of control that you're right now exerting here, breathing

05:36.240 --> 05:40.920
slowly, breathing relaxingly, breathing like this, breathing like that, breathing pleasantly

05:40.920 --> 05:48.920
normally, normal to that control can sort of obscure or prevent the clarity of the life

05:48.920 --> 05:53.240
can end, the very next, in breath or our breath.

05:53.240 --> 05:58.760
It just cannot cross into that upon which your life depends.

05:58.760 --> 06:04.800
So that's how you also abroot the notion of self, the notion of me and mine in regard

06:04.800 --> 06:09.640
to your own volition, which is the hardest thing to do, because that's the closest to you.

06:09.640 --> 06:14.680
That's intention, that direction, the point of view, but when you see normal and you do

06:14.680 --> 06:21.480
that long enough, like mindfully, willingly, intentionally, yeah, you live in nothing

06:21.480 --> 06:22.480
out.

06:22.480 --> 06:27.280
Whatever is there, you're seeing as dependent upon that, which is not in your control,

06:27.280 --> 06:33.800
which is, which is basically that breath, the, the, the life aspect in that breath, that's

06:33.800 --> 06:37.800
not in your control, the manner of your breathing you can control, but the fact that your life

06:37.800 --> 06:44.240
depends upon that breath you cannot control, that bodily breath, yeah, that very bodily

06:44.240 --> 06:48.640
breath, yeah, the organs and air moving and everything else, because it is, see, if you're

06:48.640 --> 06:53.280
seeing, if you're watching my intention to breathe, can I actually watch my intention

06:53.280 --> 06:54.280
to breathe, you see?

06:54.280 --> 06:59.360
Well, you watch that by breathing, by being my full of your breath, of course, with

06:59.360 --> 07:04.680
intention to breathe, yeah, in a particular way, as I can say, the breath in calming the

07:04.680 --> 07:11.680
body, the results of that, what I see coming at the same time, this is my, is the body breathing

07:11.680 --> 07:12.680
out.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.080
Yeah, intention is present, there's some tennis to be the body breathing in such manner.

07:16.080 --> 07:25.000
Yeah, but I was the intention to look like an intention, yeah, because I get confused

07:25.000 --> 07:32.520
with, am I now paying attention to the actual body breathing, it doesn't matter, why am

07:32.520 --> 07:33.520
I paying attention?

07:33.520 --> 07:39.160
That's where you're paying attention, as long as you're including both things.

07:39.160 --> 07:45.880
Your intention can be paying more attention to the bodily aspect or the eye and breathing

07:45.880 --> 07:46.880
aspect, doesn't matter.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
What is that?

07:47.880 --> 07:53.240
It doesn't matter, as long as both things are included, and nothing is left out in regard

07:53.240 --> 08:00.840
to seeing that fundamental dependence upon that, which is not in your control.

08:00.840 --> 08:04.920
This is an oxygen present in the breath, whatever you want to call it, whatever you want

08:04.920 --> 08:09.640
to label it, whatever you want to designate it, doesn't matter, the point is, if your intention

08:09.640 --> 08:17.240
of breathing can defeat your life depends upon it, you can control only so far, ultimately

08:17.240 --> 08:20.240
you can't.

08:20.240 --> 08:32.320
Because these exercises are like breathing, calm, calming the body, breathing, calm the

08:32.320 --> 08:40.000
bodily from it, relaxing, experiencing the whole body breathing, experiencing the whole

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
body breathing.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.440
So now I'm paying attention to the whole body.

08:44.440 --> 08:50.040
Well, basically you're just keeping it, keeping it active, keeping it, keeping it, keeping

08:50.040 --> 08:54.920
it active to remain mindful of your very evolution, because the moment you slip into a method

08:54.920 --> 08:58.880
or technique you're done, mindfulness cannot be there.

08:58.880 --> 09:03.400
It also doesn't mean that every next breath you have to do differently, all those are just

09:03.400 --> 09:09.360
listed the ways you can be doing it while remaining mindful, and then within that mindfulness

09:09.360 --> 09:18.760
of the general kind of of the fact, of the general fact that you're being undermined

09:18.760 --> 09:24.760
basically by the nature of your life's dependence upon breath, you cannot access that.

09:24.760 --> 09:33.120
You can be breathing as softly, smoothly and as controlling as you can be, but the dependence,

09:33.120 --> 09:37.520
the phenomenon that your life depends upon it on the presence of that breath, that's

09:37.520 --> 09:41.920
something you cannot control, that's just there, and if that changes, no matter if you're

09:41.920 --> 09:45.520
breathing will keep your life.

09:45.520 --> 09:52.920
Think of it like, you keep breathing normally, but suddenly there is no oxygen where you're

09:52.920 --> 09:56.880
breathing, you're breathing some, I don't know, carbon dioxide.

09:56.880 --> 10:03.360
You're still breathing, but you're not actually going to be alive for much longer despite

10:03.360 --> 10:07.520
your same evolution, same effort, same everything, but this external circumstance, this external

10:07.520 --> 10:13.840
form that your life depends upon has changed, and you cannot have an input in there.

10:13.840 --> 10:21.640
You cannot breathe in such a manner to maintain your life, so to speak, despite the absence

10:21.640 --> 10:27.040
of oxygen in there you're breathing.

10:27.040 --> 10:32.040
In other words, the aspects of which your life depends are actually a control, but not

10:32.040 --> 10:37.920
knowing that clearly enough, the notion of control that you have, or rather the notion

10:37.920 --> 10:43.720
of evolution that we have, that we can exercise, induce the notion of ultimate control, so

10:43.720 --> 10:47.680
you think you're breathing because you're alive, because your life is in your control,

10:47.680 --> 10:51.720
and then if you suddenly end up somewhere there is no oxygen to breathe in, if all that

10:51.720 --> 10:57.200
is unfortunate, incident or something, but the fact is that such things are possible means

10:57.200 --> 11:03.000
that your life is rooted outside of your control, because if you are truly in your control,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.160
no incident or accidents could happen to you of any kind.

11:06.160 --> 11:11.280
I mean breath, obviously, is the most personal action you're doing, so that's why it's

11:11.280 --> 11:16.880
a good way to reveal this, because really, your whole life, like you can be breathing

11:16.880 --> 11:21.520
and breathing, but okay, forget about it, and actually say you don't know any chemistry

11:21.520 --> 11:25.760
and stuff, so you don't think about oxygen or carbon dioxide or anything else, just

11:25.760 --> 11:32.320
have the phenomena, like mindfulness of the clear air passage in your body, that's

11:32.320 --> 11:37.720
where your life depends on, and if something obstructs it internally, your life's ending,

11:37.720 --> 11:40.280
done, and you have not say in it.

11:40.280 --> 11:46.920
If your heart stops pumping, no one breathing can help you, if your lungs get constricted

11:46.920 --> 11:54.880
or collapse or something, you're done, if something just blocks these tubes, you're done,

11:54.880 --> 11:59.320
and you're a great volition of this, like that, it's all secondary to it, and that's

11:59.320 --> 12:00.800
what you want to see.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
It extends.

12:01.800 --> 12:07.320
Hence, you do mindfulness rightly, full dispassion, full recognition of death, the nature

12:07.320 --> 12:14.800
of death, and the urgency, the urgency is automatic.

12:14.800 --> 12:22.320
You see the full extent of your control, as still being secondary to the fact that you

12:22.320 --> 12:29.320
depend upon that, which is not in your control, so you see your control has not been in your

12:29.320 --> 12:30.320
control.

12:30.320 --> 12:41.800
And that's why I'm going to give that, as an alternative to a subarm, not a musatian

12:41.800 --> 12:42.800
song.

12:42.800 --> 12:52.880
My answer to any of this also is, like, you know, let's say, Maran and Lucidie, obviously,

12:52.880 --> 12:56.840
if you're just trying to do it off the bat, you still have all the other assumptions,

12:56.840 --> 13:00.680
you know, other things, I present a lot of them, like, I assume material in my thoughts

13:00.680 --> 13:04.520
or whatever kind of change there, and that's why I think you're trying to do us to come

13:04.520 --> 13:05.520
first.

13:05.520 --> 13:11.440
Oh, yeah, well, you know, that's what we assumed in this talk, now, I hope you can do

13:11.440 --> 13:16.320
anything wrongly, anyway, so basically, yeah, you need to have the wrong view, and then

13:16.320 --> 13:21.360
if you do it like this, it will be, it will lead to the result of full dispassion, you

13:21.360 --> 13:27.560
won't lead you in itself, in the same sense, if you do Maran, Maran sati correctly, yeah,

13:27.560 --> 13:32.080
it will lead you to our engine, but if you don't do it correctly, you won't.

13:32.080 --> 13:39.720
Lisa, I'm going to suggest with that, basically, it's also the same principle, basically,

13:39.720 --> 13:45.960
you get more and more, see the general level of your experience, in what way, would you

13:45.960 --> 13:51.800
just see that bridging and ring out, basically, there's information that we see for the

13:51.800 --> 13:52.800
feelings and then the mind.

13:52.800 --> 13:57.240
Sure, yeah, as I said before, you can't do it, that doesn't mean you have to, every next

13:57.240 --> 14:00.920
breath, do it differently, you can just be breathing, as long as you're breathing mindfully.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.000
Is it a matter of choice for five?

14:03.000 --> 14:07.800
No, the point is to maintain the mindfulness of that principle, no, like going far with

14:07.800 --> 14:08.800
some repetition or something.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.280
And if you're just sort of feeling fine, you're just sort of mind fine.

14:12.280 --> 14:17.200
As long as the mindfulness is sort of slipping, or you're getting whatever, or you don't

14:17.200 --> 14:21.400
have any of the same sharpness, or you're not maintaining the same vision of the expression

14:21.400 --> 14:25.560
and your life, depending upon its fellow circumstances, right there, simultaneously present

14:25.560 --> 14:32.800
with you controlling your breath and so on, controlling in a sense of intentional, evolationally

14:32.800 --> 14:38.880
breathing in and out, then, yeah, then you keep it, that's what I said, you keep it active,

14:38.880 --> 14:43.200
and you don't change it up, and you just introduce more, to engage you more, to keep your

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
mind for more.

14:44.200 --> 14:49.640
And then the sutra continues all the way to the dispassion, evolation, and your other,

14:49.640 --> 14:55.240
almost feels like it's stages, and then it then goes to the stage of...

14:55.240 --> 14:58.800
Well, everything is presented like the stages, as I said.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.520
The casinos are presented as stages, but they're not stages in that manner.

15:02.520 --> 15:07.280
Exactly, so how far you can take it, and that's where the results to, but you don't have

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
to take it that far.

15:08.280 --> 15:13.320
Like, as I said, the first journey is sufficient for our energy, because that's already the

15:13.320 --> 15:18.360
principle of establishment of the mind, rightly, or you can go all the four.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.280
So this is the same, but that's the whole point.

15:21.280 --> 15:27.480
The four foundations of mindfulness gets fully developed, and the one who does the unappreciated

15:27.480 --> 15:31.480
rightly, and then the dispassion, and this is a journey, and this is the result of that.

15:31.480 --> 15:37.360
So we're just more like, absolute personal inclination, yeah, and you can also choice

15:37.360 --> 15:38.360
towards...

15:38.360 --> 15:39.360
It is choice, yeah.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.360
Yeah.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.360
Yeah.

15:41.360 --> 15:46.360
Because, yeah, if you think you get tired, or start to talk, then you need something more

15:46.360 --> 15:50.360
particularly, because just for breathing in general, you know, breathing, thinking of your

15:50.360 --> 15:56.060
body, breathing, looking at your mind, like, get more involved in that sense, or just

15:56.060 --> 16:00.880
breathing right now, if you're mindful enough, but mindful enough in regard to the principle

16:00.880 --> 16:05.000
of your life, depending upon that, which is an artinial control, while you're breathing

16:05.000 --> 16:07.520
there, and then...

16:07.520 --> 16:08.520
So...

16:08.520 --> 16:10.680
Notion theory, notion abstraction, right there, while I'm breathing in, while I'm breathing

16:10.680 --> 16:19.320
out, start discerning that external direction, so to speak, you can't see that domain upon

16:19.320 --> 16:23.680
which your life depends, because there will only be a form of accessing that domain.

16:23.680 --> 16:28.760
You just have a recognition that this radioactive breathing that is keeping your life and your

16:28.760 --> 16:34.280
body functioning and everything else is basically liable to things that are not in your control

16:34.280 --> 16:37.840
thus, your life is liable to things that are not in your control thus, your life cannot

16:37.840 --> 16:44.840
be in your control thus, you having a passion and desire towards anything that's dependent

16:44.840 --> 16:50.480
upon their life, are your senses, your sensuality, sensual desires, satisfaction, pleasures,

16:50.480 --> 16:51.480
cannot possibly occur.

16:51.480 --> 16:58.320
I think one of the general things people use to send their practice to do is they feel

16:58.320 --> 17:04.800
like the meditation is successful or I study successful and it's pleasant, as you can

17:04.800 --> 17:06.920
feel it's a different pleasant than doing something wrong.

17:06.920 --> 17:13.920
I find it because an instruction for suggestion is, I breathe in, experiencing venture,

17:13.920 --> 17:20.120
especially joy, as they're feeding session, so you kind of have an argument to see that

17:20.120 --> 17:21.120
you feel good.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.120
Why?

17:22.120 --> 17:25.800
Because if you look at the other things, then you might be jumping over cliffs, like I

17:25.800 --> 17:26.800
stay dead.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.960
Well, intentionally look at the, because it doesn't matter actually, still the nature

17:29.960 --> 17:30.960
of the feeling is there.

17:30.960 --> 17:36.160
So yeah, intentionally keep your body calm, focus on the rapture and stuff, why are you maintaining

17:36.160 --> 17:39.600
the principle of death in your life not being in your control?

17:39.600 --> 17:47.560
Because otherwise, you might sort of make the mind decide, oh, I had enough of this and

17:47.560 --> 17:49.600
then I'm still thinking that they're done.

17:49.600 --> 17:54.840
But yeah, important of being always letting, I don't know, experiencing rapture, no, I'm

17:54.840 --> 17:59.560
just going to go into it, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, the

17:59.560 --> 18:09.560
pleasure is not any measure whatsoever of your progress, it's basically that kind of

18:09.560 --> 18:17.560
inshakable, unshakable nature of the composure and the peace in the face of death, which is

18:17.560 --> 18:24.080
not pleasant, but that this pleasure cannot overwhelm your mind and that's pleasant.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.440
But if you're just looking out to some sort of rapture, or rapture and excitement or something

18:27.440 --> 18:33.080
while you're looking more at least, well, you're certainly using it out for the long reasons.

18:33.080 --> 18:43.080
Yeah, or if you look at it at the end, the contemplating phenomenon, things like impermanence,

18:43.080 --> 18:47.080
I don't know if they use it in each of them, but that's it.

18:47.080 --> 18:51.880
Well, they were using Sajipatana, and it does say that Sajipatana will be brought to

18:51.880 --> 18:54.880
you if you look at it in quality of it, in each of them.

18:54.880 --> 18:55.880
No.

18:55.880 --> 19:01.880
While you're being converted, cessation or de-creation, is the idea that one works, is it?

19:01.880 --> 19:03.880
But decreasing or intensifying?

19:03.880 --> 19:04.880
Yeah.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.880
They are rising and falling, whatever.

19:08.880 --> 19:15.880
I was ceasing and then disfession, you know.

19:15.880 --> 19:30.880
There's the revolution and the liberation, the delinquishing's detachment.

19:30.880 --> 19:35.880
And there are many more students, like when it says highly experienced delinquishing and detachment

19:35.880 --> 19:42.880
or dispassion and revulsion, but seeing that it's horrible, it's perilous, it's dangerous,

19:42.880 --> 19:43.880
it's a trap.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.880
So the mind pulls away from it, turns away from it.

19:46.880 --> 19:51.880
Like a man being carried to a pit full of burning ambers.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.880
He might as well be in every other direction except there was burning ambers.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.880
He wants to be everywhere else except there.

19:58.880 --> 20:04.880
And that's what Anabalusati provides you with, if that's right or not.

20:04.880 --> 20:10.880
Because it is the very core of your experience, so to speak, given spatially speaking,

20:10.880 --> 20:14.880
like the breathing, the center of your body, the center of your...

20:14.880 --> 20:20.880
Well, so it appears, the center of your point of view, the center of me.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.880
So basically, you are prudent from right there.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.880
And then there's nothing you can take.

20:26.880 --> 20:33.880
As yours, once you've given up, the ownership of your breath through a stringent system.

20:33.880 --> 20:34.880
But...

20:34.880 --> 20:35.880
Exactly.

20:35.880 --> 20:40.880
Through seeing that your control, your intention is only very relative,

20:40.880 --> 20:44.880
and given, which means it's not fundamentally your control.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.880
So that's the wrong...

20:46.880 --> 20:47.880
You might feel...

20:47.880 --> 20:49.880
Yeah, the point is in the right order.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.880
My sense of screenings, pointings in the right order.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.880
Seeing where the breath, your control is rooted.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.880
Yeah.

20:56.880 --> 21:05.880
The body, element, whatever, or experience, it's feelings being there, mind being there.

21:05.880 --> 21:06.880
Yeah.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.880
So, as you said the other day, it's not being...

21:09.880 --> 21:11.880
It's coming from a different direction.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.880
That intention itself is not...

21:14.880 --> 21:17.880
It's not created independently by myself.

21:17.880 --> 21:18.880
Right.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.880
Exactly.

21:19.880 --> 21:20.880
I see ways come from...

21:20.880 --> 21:21.880
Right.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.880
Then you see that whatever else is here, on biggest, in general,

21:25.880 --> 21:28.880
in not clear, in vague,

21:28.880 --> 21:32.880
which is the same nature as everything, or these things that are understood.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.880
So you don't have to chase your sense of self.

21:34.880 --> 21:35.880
You get...

21:35.880 --> 21:40.880
You get surfacted by that kind of blanket application of that principle.

21:40.880 --> 21:41.880
Yeah.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.880
I'll give that example before I can't do politics.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.880
You don't necessarily...

21:45.880 --> 21:46.880
No.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.880
I don't know.

21:49.880 --> 21:54.880
Which bacteria is sort of causing the problem by taking the general one.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.880
You know, well, whatever it was, it was also affected by this.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.880
But that's only possible when you have the right principle.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.880
That's why the right view has to come first.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.880
You can't just be doing mindfulness of breathing and expecting.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.880
I mean, you should be trying, anyway.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.880
You know, even conclusion should be trying to understand things.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.880
Understand the nature of satipatana, understand the nature of feelings,

22:15.880 --> 22:17.880
the nature of suffering, the nature of freedom from it.

22:17.880 --> 22:18.880
Yeah, absolutely.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.880
But don't fool yourself about it.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.880
You cannot do it rightly if you know what right away it is.

22:23.880 --> 22:24.880
Yeah, you can.

22:24.880 --> 22:25.880
I did that.

22:25.880 --> 22:26.880
I did that.

22:26.880 --> 22:27.880
I did that.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.880
Closer you go.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.880
Yeah.

22:29.880 --> 22:30.880
It is a degree of trial and error.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.880
Yeah.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.880
That's why again, as I said, the closest comes to some sort of method,

22:34.880 --> 22:35.880
this constant strike.

22:35.880 --> 22:36.880
Relentless.

22:36.880 --> 22:40.880
And even you're resting, don't give up the mindfulness.

22:40.880 --> 22:44.880
So, if you're resting, don't give up the mindfulness.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.880
So, if you're resting, don't give up the mindfulness.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.880
If you're resting, don't give up the mindfulness.

22:50.880 --> 22:56.880
So, it's turning, it's seeing the structure correctly.

22:56.880 --> 23:02.880
All the other things, correctly, but where everything's rooted,

23:02.880 --> 23:06.880
it's pushing that center out of center.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.880
Well, it's just an armating.

23:08.880 --> 23:12.880
It's just, I mean, the center, faith is well gone.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.880
Like the notion of center cannot even be conceived anymore.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.880
The notion of I am the center.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.880
That's why that sort of one cannot think like the Tujan anymore.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.880
He can remember around the world, but he can't think like...

23:25.880 --> 23:28.880
He was going to think that the center is over there.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.880
No, no, no, no.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.880
Because in order for you to center something,

23:33.880 --> 23:36.880
means you need to have what you need to have the space around it

23:36.880 --> 23:38.880
to put it in a center.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.880
But his whole direction is out of your control.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.880
And you can't even access it.

23:42.880 --> 23:47.880
Thus, whenever the center might be, it's on the other side.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.880
Which means it's not really a center,

23:49.880 --> 23:51.880
because there will only require the assumption of certain space.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.880
And this precedes that.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.880
So then it's just center less.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.880
I eat self less.

23:57.880 --> 24:01.880
Yeah, that's where you get your idea.

24:01.880 --> 24:05.880
It was, you know, whatever's in front.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.880
It's just, however far you go,

24:07.880 --> 24:09.880
it can never be yours.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.880
No, yeah, yeah.

24:11.880 --> 24:16.880
Well, basically, the front behind up and down

24:16.880 --> 24:19.880
before or after all of that

24:19.880 --> 24:21.880
is already secondary to that,

24:21.880 --> 24:23.880
because of which your life is there,

24:23.880 --> 24:24.880
determined as it is,

24:24.880 --> 24:27.880
to that upon which your life depends.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.880
And even you have a notion of my life depends upon something.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.880
That's already within that,

24:31.880 --> 24:34.880
upon which your life depends.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.880
In other words, any spatial direction,

24:36.880 --> 24:39.880
any time application,

24:39.880 --> 24:41.880
I thought, it's already within that.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.880
And there is no outside of it

24:43.880 --> 24:45.880
that you can possibly conceive.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.880
There is no outside of the five aggregates.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.880
So what you can do is experience this passion towards it,

24:51.880 --> 24:53.880
because you know that it's liable to things

24:53.880 --> 24:54.880
that are not in your control,

24:54.880 --> 24:56.880
because of which this,

24:56.880 --> 24:57.880
which is your in control,

24:57.880 --> 24:58.880
is in your control,

24:58.880 --> 24:59.880
it's not really in your control,

24:59.880 --> 25:00.880
because if you were,

25:00.880 --> 25:07.880
you would be controlling its fate as one.

25:07.880 --> 25:08.880
It's the same principle,

25:08.880 --> 25:10.880
like the body is liable to sickness,

25:10.880 --> 25:12.880
thus it's not mine.

25:12.880 --> 25:16.880
Like, anybody, everyone understands their thoughts,

25:16.880 --> 25:19.880
in a way, to a degree.

25:19.880 --> 25:20.880
But it's, if you really,

25:20.880 --> 25:21.880
to understand their thoughts,

25:21.880 --> 25:23.880
you would fully let go of sensuality

25:23.880 --> 25:26.880
and become ungodly.

25:26.880 --> 25:27.880
It's the same thought.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.880
It's just taken to a different extent.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.880
So, they, their thoughts,

25:33.880 --> 25:34.880
and paired with their alanseness,

25:34.880 --> 25:36.880
drilling, and not resting.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.880
And yet, you'll be free from sensuality,

25:38.880 --> 25:39.880
even as a protugina.

25:39.880 --> 25:44.880
That's how they're likely to remain protugina.

25:44.880 --> 25:51.880
Because you have plenty of down-instruction around you.

25:51.880 --> 25:52.880
And it's the same principle

25:52.880 --> 25:53.880
that you apply to the mind,

25:53.880 --> 25:54.880
the notion of space,

25:54.880 --> 25:55.880
the notion of time,

25:55.880 --> 25:56.880
the notion of thoughts,

25:56.880 --> 25:57.880
intentions, again,

25:57.880 --> 26:00.880
rooted,

26:00.880 --> 26:02.880
or rather depend upon that,

26:02.880 --> 26:04.880
which you cannot even conceive of,

26:04.880 --> 26:06.880
think of.

26:06.880 --> 26:07.880
Because of that,

26:07.880 --> 26:10.880
so do you.

26:10.880 --> 26:11.880
You, you, you, you, you,

26:11.880 --> 26:12.880
you still use it,

26:12.880 --> 26:13.880
but you have, uh,

26:13.880 --> 26:14.880
but enough extinguished

26:14.880 --> 26:16.880
any notions of ownership

26:16.880 --> 26:17.880
in regard to it.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
In the same sense,

26:18.880 --> 26:19.880
you extinguish the

26:19.880 --> 26:21.880
any notion of ownership

26:21.880 --> 26:22.880
in regard to the book,

26:22.880 --> 26:25.880
and what both it provides.

26:25.880 --> 26:26.880
And we're also in the other nights,

26:26.880 --> 26:27.880
like, I was in a,

26:27.880 --> 26:28.880
in the car,

26:28.880 --> 26:29.880
I'm not doing any in the car.

26:29.880 --> 26:30.880
Car manipulation.

26:30.880 --> 26:31.880
Existing.

26:31.880 --> 26:32.880
Existing.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.880
No, yeah.

26:33.880 --> 26:34.880
Yeah, it's closed.

26:34.880 --> 26:35.880
They're just feeding the car,

26:35.880 --> 26:36.880
moving past all.

26:36.880 --> 26:37.880
Yeah, moving.

26:37.880 --> 26:38.880
And,

26:38.880 --> 26:39.880
because it's,

26:39.880 --> 26:40.880
it's really, uh,

26:40.880 --> 26:41.880
political.

26:41.880 --> 26:42.880
Oh, yeah.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.880
And feeling of,

26:43.880 --> 26:44.880
you could get it.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.880
And the mind automatically was,

26:46.880 --> 26:48.880
I'm, I'm moving away from this.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.880
Yeah.

26:49.880 --> 26:50.880
Yeah.

26:50.880 --> 26:51.880
The mind doesn't want to think that,

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
because it's,

26:52.880 --> 26:53.880
it's threatening.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.880
Because the mind is still

26:55.880 --> 26:56.880
driven by fear,

26:56.880 --> 26:57.880
or can be driven by fear,

26:57.880 --> 26:58.880
or it doubts

26:58.880 --> 26:59.880
whether it can be driven by fear.

26:59.880 --> 27:00.880
So it fears it,

27:00.880 --> 27:02.880
which means it's driven by fear.

27:02.880 --> 27:03.880
If my doubts,

27:03.880 --> 27:05.880
whether the fear can penetrate it,

27:05.880 --> 27:06.880
it's penetrated by fear.

27:06.880 --> 27:07.880
The doubt,

27:07.880 --> 27:08.880
cause,

27:08.880 --> 27:09.880
like, created the bridge,

27:09.880 --> 27:10.880
so to speak.

27:10.880 --> 27:11.880
But the only way to free yourself,

27:11.880 --> 27:12.880
in doubt,

27:12.880 --> 27:13.880
is to train your mind

27:13.880 --> 27:14.880
in regard to fear.

27:14.880 --> 27:15.880
So maybe,

27:15.880 --> 27:16.880
I don't,

27:16.880 --> 27:17.880
I don't know,

27:17.880 --> 27:18.880
this is different fear.

27:18.880 --> 27:19.880
I mean, like,

27:19.880 --> 27:21.880
when you see the possibility,

27:21.880 --> 27:22.880
uh-huh.

27:22.880 --> 27:23.880
You see,

27:23.880 --> 27:24.880
when I see it,

27:24.880 --> 27:25.880
if I'm here,

27:25.880 --> 27:27.880
hey, this is me.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.880
That's a problem.

27:29.880 --> 27:30.880
Oh, right, right.

27:30.880 --> 27:31.880
Well,

27:31.880 --> 27:32.880
if I get answered,

27:32.880 --> 27:33.880
speak detached.

27:33.880 --> 27:34.880
Oh, I see.

27:34.880 --> 27:35.880
Yeah, mind from that.

27:35.880 --> 27:36.880
Right.

27:36.880 --> 27:37.880
Is there any?

27:37.880 --> 27:38.880
There is just,

27:38.880 --> 27:39.880
there is an experience,

27:39.880 --> 27:40.880
in a sense of,

27:40.880 --> 27:41.880
yeah, a very dangerous

27:41.880 --> 27:42.880
parenthesis,

27:42.880 --> 27:43.880
close to that experience.

27:43.880 --> 27:44.880
But even that,

27:44.880 --> 27:45.880
it's not mine.

27:45.880 --> 27:46.880
Yes, I guess.

27:46.880 --> 27:47.880
Well, if you stick to that,

27:47.880 --> 27:48.880
even when you're not just in the car,

27:48.880 --> 27:49.880
you,

27:49.880 --> 27:50.880
you would be basically practicing

27:50.880 --> 27:51.880
this passion correctly,

27:51.880 --> 27:52.880
which means sooner or later,

27:52.880 --> 27:53.880
it would take root

27:53.880 --> 27:54.880
more and more,

27:54.880 --> 27:56.880
and become self-apparent.

27:56.880 --> 27:57.880
Yeah,

27:57.880 --> 27:58.880
it's also very well

27:58.880 --> 27:59.880
back to the breath.

27:59.880 --> 28:00.880
You know,

28:00.880 --> 28:01.880
I was saying,

28:01.880 --> 28:02.880
what is crucial,

28:02.880 --> 28:03.880
actually,

28:03.880 --> 28:04.880
feeling unpleasant feeling?

28:04.880 --> 28:05.880
To me,

28:05.880 --> 28:06.880
then, actually,

28:06.880 --> 28:07.880
it feels kind of,

28:07.880 --> 28:08.880
firstly,

28:08.880 --> 28:09.880
you can do a mindfulness,

28:09.880 --> 28:10.880
and it's not so much like,

28:10.880 --> 28:11.880
I feel certain,

28:11.880 --> 28:12.880
that I'm feeling,

28:12.880 --> 28:13.880
which is just mindfulness

28:13.880 --> 28:14.880
becomes like,

28:14.880 --> 28:15.880
the feeling is present.

28:15.880 --> 28:16.880
Yeah.

28:16.880 --> 28:17.880
And also, when you were

28:17.880 --> 28:18.880
talking about, like,

28:18.880 --> 28:19.880
the dying process,

28:19.880 --> 28:21.880
everything is slightly

28:21.880 --> 28:22.880
the body is shutting down,

28:22.880 --> 28:23.880
like, everything becomes

28:23.880 --> 28:24.880
unpleasant,

28:24.880 --> 28:25.880
and the mind moves away

28:25.880 --> 28:26.880
from anything

28:26.880 --> 28:27.880
unpleasant,

28:27.880 --> 28:28.880
and I don't know,

28:28.880 --> 28:30.880
certain body parts,

28:30.880 --> 28:31.880
you know,

28:31.880 --> 28:32.880
just drones,

28:32.880 --> 28:33.880
and then it should,

28:33.880 --> 28:34.880
even the breathing becomes,

28:34.880 --> 28:35.880
well, even the mind,

28:35.880 --> 28:37.880
even the thought itself becomes

28:37.880 --> 28:38.880
unpleasant,

28:38.880 --> 28:39.880
and that's why, like,

28:39.880 --> 28:40.880
the dying man has only

28:40.880 --> 28:42.880
wisdom to rely upon,

28:42.880 --> 28:43.880
if he has developed it,

28:43.880 --> 28:45.880
if he hasn't,

28:45.880 --> 28:46.880
he would be an ultimate

28:46.880 --> 28:47.880
despair,

28:47.880 --> 28:49.880
which is why that is so hard,

28:49.880 --> 28:50.880
and difficult,

28:50.880 --> 28:51.880
as an experience.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.880
But wisdom,

28:53.880 --> 28:55.880
not being dependent upon any,

28:55.880 --> 28:57.880
any phenomena,

28:57.880 --> 28:58.880
upon the basic,

28:58.880 --> 28:59.880
on six senses,

28:59.880 --> 29:00.880
but it's in regard to the

29:00.880 --> 29:01.880
six senses,

29:01.880 --> 29:02.880
the five senses in the mind,

29:02.880 --> 29:03.880
that's what it says,

29:03.880 --> 29:04.880
that's where the

29:04.880 --> 29:05.880
peace is,

29:05.880 --> 29:06.880
that's where the equilibrium is,

29:06.880 --> 29:07.880
that's where not fear,

29:07.880 --> 29:08.880
lack of fear is,

29:08.880 --> 29:10.880
that's where our

29:10.880 --> 29:11.880
energy is really,

29:11.880 --> 29:12.880
our energy is really,

29:12.880 --> 29:13.880
so death,

29:13.880 --> 29:14.880
no death,

29:14.880 --> 29:15.880
makes no difference,

29:15.880 --> 29:16.880
mind doesn't pick on anything,

29:16.880 --> 29:17.880
doesn't intrude

29:17.880 --> 29:18.880
anything,

29:18.880 --> 29:19.880
so it doesn't get reborn,

29:19.880 --> 29:21.880
done?

29:21.880 --> 29:22.880
As with the thinking,

29:22.880 --> 29:23.880
like,

29:23.880 --> 29:24.880
sometimes we're talking about

29:24.880 --> 29:26.880
a peaceful death,

29:26.880 --> 29:27.880
actually,

29:27.880 --> 29:28.880
all we do is

29:28.880 --> 29:29.880
like,

29:29.880 --> 29:30.880
and the death has to be

29:30.880 --> 29:31.880
unpleasant.

29:31.880 --> 29:32.880
Well,

29:32.880 --> 29:33.880
the only peaceful death

29:33.880 --> 29:34.880
is

29:34.880 --> 29:35.880
Farraham's death.

29:35.880 --> 29:36.880
Yes.

29:36.880 --> 29:37.880
There's no such thing

29:37.880 --> 29:38.880
as peace from death.

29:38.880 --> 29:39.880
No, that's one,

29:39.880 --> 29:40.880
isn't it?

29:40.880 --> 29:41.880
Yes.

29:41.880 --> 29:42.880
Some people say,

29:42.880 --> 29:43.880
though,

29:43.880 --> 29:44.880
I'm a child about

29:44.880 --> 29:45.880
how to prepare people

29:45.880 --> 29:46.880
to have a peaceful death.

29:46.880 --> 29:47.880
I'm

29:47.880 --> 29:48.880
just saying,

29:48.880 --> 29:49.880
if anyone correctly,

29:49.880 --> 29:51.880
he also saw the

29:51.880 --> 29:52.880
peace,

29:52.880 --> 29:54.880
just about to be

29:54.880 --> 29:55.880
slaughtered with a smile

29:55.880 --> 29:56.880
on the face.

29:56.880 --> 29:57.880
So,

29:57.880 --> 29:59.880
we just appear

29:59.880 --> 30:00.880
well,

30:00.880 --> 30:01.880
this

30:01.880 --> 30:02.880
doesn't

30:02.880 --> 30:03.880
move

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
at this moment.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.880
Just something

30:06.880 --> 30:07.880
that's

30:07.880 --> 30:08.880
different.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.880
You know,

30:10.880 --> 30:11.880
the experience of the

30:11.880 --> 30:12.880
body,

30:12.880 --> 30:13.880
we're talking about

30:13.880 --> 30:14.880
content being

30:14.880 --> 30:15.880
pressure,

30:15.880 --> 30:16.880
isn't it?

30:16.880 --> 30:17.880
So, it could be,

30:17.880 --> 30:18.880
like, the body

30:18.880 --> 30:19.880
pressure,

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
okay,

30:20.880 --> 30:21.880
and feelings

30:21.880 --> 30:22.880
could use it to

30:22.880 --> 30:23.880
touch it,

30:23.880 --> 30:24.880
to touch it,

30:24.880 --> 30:26.880
experience.

30:26.880 --> 30:27.880
As

30:27.880 --> 30:28.880
a musical

30:28.880 --> 30:29.880
sound,

30:29.880 --> 30:30.880
I don't

30:30.880 --> 30:31.880
know.

30:31.880 --> 30:31.880
I just

30:31.880 --> 30:32.880
can't

30:32.880 --> 30:33.880
I just thought

30:33.880 --> 30:34.880
of that word,

30:34.880 --> 30:35.880
but it's like

30:35.880 --> 30:36.880
the thing is, yeah.

30:36.880 --> 30:37.880
I mean,

30:37.880 --> 30:38.880
maybe it means for

30:38.880 --> 30:39.880
something more,

30:39.880 --> 30:40.880
but someone

30:40.880 --> 30:41.880
is a

30:41.880 --> 30:42.880
designation.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.880
I don't know.

30:43.880 --> 30:44.880
He's a

30:44.880 --> 30:45.880
problem

30:45.880 --> 30:46.880
I have to

30:46.880 --> 30:47.880
qualify.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.880
Maybe

30:48.880 --> 30:49.880
I'll think

30:49.880 --> 30:50.880
of that more,

30:50.880 --> 30:51.880
but he has feelings

30:51.880 --> 30:52.880
more.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.880
So, I don't

30:53.880 --> 30:54.880
experience.

30:54.880 --> 30:55.880
Well,

30:55.880 --> 30:56.880
you can,

30:56.880 --> 30:57.880
you can,

30:57.880 --> 30:58.880
but it doesn't

30:58.880 --> 30:59.880
mean that for you,

30:59.880 --> 31:00.880
it doesn't

31:00.880 --> 31:01.880
stand closer

31:01.880 --> 31:02.880
to that which

31:02.880 --> 31:03.880
feeling is,

31:03.880 --> 31:04.880
then if you

31:04.880 --> 31:05.880
is designation

31:05.880 --> 31:06.880
feeling.

31:06.880 --> 31:07.880
So, yeah.

31:07.880 --> 31:08.880
It's fine.

31:08.880 --> 31:09.880
Call it

31:09.880 --> 31:10.880
whatever you want

31:10.880 --> 31:11.880
with it.

31:11.880 --> 31:12.880
The mind

31:12.880 --> 31:13.880
being

31:13.880 --> 31:14.880
shaped.

31:14.880 --> 31:15.880
Well, sure.

31:15.880 --> 31:16.880
Yeah.

31:16.880 --> 31:17.880
The general

31:17.880 --> 31:18.880
is

31:18.880 --> 31:19.880
as it takes it.

31:19.880 --> 31:20.880
Yeah.

31:20.880 --> 31:21.880
It's

31:21.880 --> 31:22.880
abundant pressure.

31:22.880 --> 31:23.880
But,

31:23.880 --> 31:24.880
but one thing,

31:24.880 --> 31:25.880
like, I'm,

31:25.880 --> 31:26.880
well, I'm

31:26.880 --> 31:27.880
going to say,

31:27.880 --> 31:28.880
yes, you don't

31:28.880 --> 31:29.880
mean that, but I think

31:29.880 --> 31:30.880
it's just useful to

31:30.880 --> 31:31.880
call it.

31:31.880 --> 31:32.880
Like, when you say

31:32.880 --> 31:33.880
mind is a

31:33.880 --> 31:34.880
shape, that doesn't,

31:34.880 --> 31:35.880
doesn't mean

31:35.880 --> 31:36.880
you can see that

31:36.880 --> 31:37.880
shape externally.

31:37.880 --> 31:38.880
It means you just

31:38.880 --> 31:39.880
find that

31:39.880 --> 31:40.880
shape.

31:40.880 --> 31:41.880
Find

31:41.880 --> 31:42.880
the experience

31:42.880 --> 31:43.880
shape.

31:43.880 --> 31:44.880
Which means that's

31:44.880 --> 31:45.880
what the mind is at

31:45.880 --> 31:46.880
time.

31:46.880 --> 31:47.880
You can't have

31:47.880 --> 31:48.880
step outside the mind.

31:48.880 --> 31:49.880
You see the mind is

31:49.880 --> 31:50.880
such.

31:50.880 --> 31:51.880
Like, all

31:51.880 --> 31:52.880
my mind is such

31:52.880 --> 31:53.880
shape.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.880
No, excuse me.

31:54.880 --> 31:55.880
Yeah.

31:55.880 --> 31:56.880
No, I'm not taking

31:56.880 --> 31:57.880
external view

31:57.880 --> 31:58.880
and saying this.

31:58.880 --> 31:59.880
Yeah.

31:59.880 --> 32:00.880
Yeah.

32:00.880 --> 32:01.880
Yeah.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.880
Yeah.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.880
So you can't

32:03.880 --> 32:04.880
describe it.

32:04.880 --> 32:05.880
Sure.

32:05.880 --> 32:06.880
Yeah.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.880
And that's what's

32:07.880 --> 32:08.880
out the colonel does.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.880
He knows his mind.

32:09.880 --> 32:10.880
As expanded mind.

32:10.880 --> 32:11.880
As struck me.

32:11.880 --> 32:12.880
As depressed mind.

32:12.880 --> 32:13.880
As enlightened mind.

32:13.880 --> 32:14.880
As light mind.

32:14.880 --> 32:15.880
As heavy mind.

32:15.880 --> 32:16.880
Whatever.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.880
Because you can use

32:17.880 --> 32:17.880
very general

32:17.880 --> 32:18.880
designations because

32:18.880 --> 32:19.880
those you can't

32:19.880 --> 32:20.880
have more particular

32:20.880 --> 32:21.880
ones.

32:21.880 --> 32:22.880
Could be if I'm

32:22.880 --> 32:23.880
saying I'm

32:23.880 --> 32:24.880
paying attention to

32:24.880 --> 32:25.880
that.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.880
That's why I'm trying

32:27.880 --> 32:28.880
just.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.880
Well, I'm not.

32:29.880 --> 32:30.880
Just editing what

32:30.880 --> 32:31.880
arises.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.880
Is it right?

32:32.880 --> 32:33.880
Good.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.880
Good.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.880
Very thoroughly.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.880
And seeing that as

32:37.880 --> 32:38.880
the approach

32:38.880 --> 32:39.880
is the foundation

32:39.880 --> 32:42.880
for the measurements

32:42.880 --> 32:44.880
of this attention

32:44.880 --> 32:28.880
to breathe,

32:46.880 --> 32:47.880
calmly.

32:47.880 --> 32:48.880
Okay.

32:48.880 --> 32:49.880
Maybe I get it.

32:49.880 --> 32:50.880
Yep.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.880
And so, wherever

32:52.880 --> 32:51.880
arises.

32:51.880 --> 32:52.880
So, when I'm looking

32:52.880 --> 33:05.400
shape to make this shape. I'm looking at my intention. And I can see the shape around

33:05.400 --> 33:14.880
it. So you discern the shape as a given one. Yeah, yeah. But on a more, on a more

33:14.880 --> 33:23.000
practical, it's probably a bit more useful for why the audience, I guess, would be, not

33:23.000 --> 33:29.480
getting too abstract about this shape, but just discerning the shape, or rather discerning

33:29.480 --> 33:36.480
the mind affected by sensuality. Well, discerning the mind, not affected by sensuality, discerning

33:36.480 --> 33:42.600
the mind affected by the will, discerning the mind, not affected by the will, discerning

33:42.600 --> 33:54.760
the mind affected by delusion, by non-delusion. That's kind of very fundamental. Discerning

33:54.760 --> 34:04.320
the mind affected by pleasure, affected by displeasure. Because none of those shapes of the mind

34:04.320 --> 34:15.100
responded to this, so that are kind of impersonal, so to speak. They're all being felt. I had a

34:15.100 --> 34:20.360
pleasure in the Quran, but whether it's a pleasure caused by the peace, freedom, or it's a pleasure

34:20.360 --> 34:27.040
caused by the prospect of sensuality, elation, delight, which means it's a pleasure really.

34:27.040 --> 34:32.580
So you want to see that, because like you might not be engaging in any sensual acts, you

34:32.580 --> 34:39.000
might be well-restrained, but the mind is still affected by the possibility of sensual

34:39.000 --> 34:45.520
pleasure that you are welcoming. So you want to be stopped. You want to stop the welcoming.

34:45.520 --> 34:52.520
You want to undermine the possibility of pleasure affecting you. You can't undermine

34:52.520 --> 34:59.840
the possibility of pleasure. You can't undermine eyes seeing things that they will find

34:59.840 --> 35:03.900
agreeable. Here's hearing sounds that they will find agreeable, for as long as you have

35:03.900 --> 35:08.640
eyes ears and other senses. What you can do is, on the level of their mind, free your

35:08.640 --> 35:15.960
mind from the welcoming and delighting in the possibility of being so. And then, whatever

35:15.960 --> 35:21.520
is particularly, you can't give in. Because possibilities are more general, more fundamental

35:21.520 --> 35:26.720
than the particular arising of any of them. So if your mind is free from possibility

35:26.720 --> 35:33.720
of delighting in pleasure, you cannot actually delight in any pleasure right there and then.

35:33.720 --> 35:40.040
So you have been dispassionates in regards to? That's what I expect is a lot of kindness,

35:40.040 --> 35:49.640
for example, the matter you say. Basically, you have surmounted the possibility of your

35:49.640 --> 35:55.920
mind giving in to the will. Welcome in your will. They can join your will. Engaging in

35:55.920 --> 36:01.520
your will. You have removed that. Thus, automatically, your experiencing meant indirectly, your

36:01.520 --> 36:11.120
experience meant, you're not forcing anything. So, layer. You, you, you, the focus of attention

36:11.120 --> 36:15.800
of your breathing or whatever. And when you see the peripheral sort of experiences,

36:15.800 --> 36:21.480
a whole notion of the mind there, see, is there liable to sensuality? Like, if you have

36:21.480 --> 36:26.920
sensual thought now, will it cause the delight and excitement? And welcoming. Yeah, that's

36:26.920 --> 36:33.120
where the problem is. So you want to remove that on that peripheral level. But if I'm

36:33.120 --> 36:38.440
not delighting. Yeah, you can remove the actual possibility where you can remove your delight

36:38.440 --> 36:45.480
in it. And if you stop delighting the possibility of sensuality, you cannot possibly engage in

36:45.480 --> 36:51.480
it then in it actually. But in particular. I mean, my mind is breathing is doing any way

36:51.480 --> 36:55.280
to just focus on it. Yeah, yeah. I know. I'm just, you started talking about the mind

36:55.280 --> 36:58.880
and the shape of it. And I'm just telling you rather than there is a risk of getting lost

36:58.880 --> 37:03.880
in abstract if you start sort of drawing lines and shapes and stuff. I mean, it, for some

37:03.880 --> 37:10.480
people, it might work in the same manner, but the point is dispassion. The point is non-sensuality.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.960
So if you're thinking about the shapes of your mind, it should lead to dispassion. If it's

37:13.960 --> 37:21.560
not, you're not thinking about it. You can't just do dispassion. Well, you could theoretically,

37:21.560 --> 37:27.440
if you say no on the right peripheral level. Peripherally, if you say no. Not just if you

37:27.440 --> 37:31.600
say no actually, and then hope that everything else will get affected by it. Okay, yeah,

37:31.600 --> 37:38.880
when you're talking about peripherals, proper minds. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not involved

37:38.880 --> 37:46.720
in that. Yeah. Yeah. No, but you're probably seeing it. Peripherally renouncement. I might

37:46.720 --> 37:53.040
fully see it and might fully renounce it. This isn't it? Possibility. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

37:53.040 --> 38:00.240
The distance, whether in the mind is actually good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is it still liable

38:00.240 --> 38:05.960
to it? Because you are responsible for that. You know, responsible for eyes, finding certain

38:05.960 --> 38:11.480
things agreeable, certain things disagreeable. But you are responsible for maintaining the

38:11.480 --> 38:15.680
notions of delight and assumptions in your mind, which then keep the minds susceptible

38:15.680 --> 38:22.120
and liable to changes of weather, changes of mood, of sexuality, of your will, of delusion,

38:22.120 --> 38:31.720
of complacency. That's a new. So when the mind is bright and mindful, you look at the

38:31.720 --> 38:37.480
nature of that and then try to sort of spread, so to speak, on that peripheral level,

38:37.480 --> 38:42.480
that nature further and further and further, until you can understand how it can become

38:42.480 --> 38:50.320
impanetrable to the possibility of sexuality. You cannot prevent possibility of sexuality

38:50.320 --> 38:54.680
arising and manifesting itself, but you can certainly train your mind to turn away

38:54.680 --> 39:00.440
from it, to stop delighting it, stop welcoming it, stop assuming it as good.

39:00.440 --> 39:09.600
So the possibility always comes first before the actual engagement. Sure. Well, not comes

39:09.600 --> 39:13.240
first in the sense of first, second, the single thing is present with the actual engagement,

39:13.240 --> 39:20.040
but it precedes it more generally. It's more fundamental because it does. Yeah. Just

39:20.040 --> 39:28.560
not delighting in that. Yeah. So you know, nothing specific, nothing specific, just the

39:28.560 --> 39:37.760
possibility of enjoying pleasure based upon body. That's it. Don't go there. No, no, no,

39:37.760 --> 39:42.560
no, no, no, no, no. It's not like going there or not going there. That thing has already

39:42.560 --> 39:46.880
risen, so you just like stop welcoming that, stop regarding it as much and stop finding

39:46.880 --> 39:58.120
it agreeable. Stop not seeing it as dangerous. Because you're not seeing it as dangerous,

39:58.120 --> 40:04.400
automatically, you're welcoming it. But only how to see it as dangerous, you are not

40:04.400 --> 40:12.120
welcoming. Not more than that man will welcome the pitful burning embers. That's often in

40:12.120 --> 40:17.480
the source of the danger we can apparent and the mind will liberate it. Because the danger

40:17.480 --> 40:23.440
is there. It's actual dangerous. You're not contriving, you're not fabricating any danger.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.920
You might have to do so initially so they can correspond to the actual danger that can

40:26.920 --> 40:39.360
then be discerned. But it is actually dangerous. Laughter and dangerous. Just essential thought,

40:39.360 --> 40:47.760
let alone essential action. Because it's, yeah, it's crap, it's the story of wisdom. No,

40:47.760 --> 40:53.000
because it's dangerous. That's it. You don't have to give reasons. Well, all that is

40:53.000 --> 40:58.080
in the level of reasoning, which means all that is not directly seeing the danger. You

40:58.080 --> 41:03.040
want to see the danger as danger. Then you can reason only one. Not only that. So think

41:03.040 --> 41:07.200
about the phenomenon of danger. How do I get there as a danger to your life now, right

41:07.200 --> 41:11.400
here? How would you feel? That's how you should feel when the sensual thought arises,

41:11.400 --> 41:17.100
in the same manner. Like your life is on the line.

41:17.100 --> 41:21.000
Sensual thought, not any thought, not any agreeable thought. Just a thought pertaining to the

41:21.000 --> 41:26.360
pleasure based upon body. You're going to become neurotic about it either in the sense

41:26.360 --> 41:32.400
of like nothing, a javelinous accept, and everything is dangerous. Yeah. Yeah, all

41:32.400 --> 41:39.600
some things are. No, if the demand is, no thinking, no, no thinking, any, any essential

41:39.600 --> 41:48.280
things, any is at the same time, withdrawing itself from being, from being sort of allowable

41:48.280 --> 41:54.600
to the touch or the possibility of the sensual things, basically, it cannot be touched by

41:54.600 --> 42:00.640
the possibilities either, even if they are arising, even on the level of mind, a thought of pleasure,

42:00.640 --> 42:05.720
doesn't pull them on towards their pleasure. That's fine. You don't have to keep pressing

42:05.720 --> 42:12.080
it further. Keep it there. This was there. Stand it there. That's actually the first

42:12.080 --> 42:24.440
question. So when I say the surmounting, the possibilities of sensual pleasure, that's

42:24.440 --> 42:30.880
what the suitors, when they talk about preventing the other reason and wholesome states from

42:30.880 --> 42:36.680
arising. You prevent them by not delighting in the possibility of them. Basically, other

42:36.680 --> 42:43.080
reason and wholesome states are the possibilities of the sensuality, which is unwholesome, are

42:43.080 --> 42:49.880
the possibilities of unwholesome, be it sensuality or your work. So another reason unwholesome

42:49.880 --> 42:56.240
equals possibility of unwholesome. And that's where you basically, on that level, you free

42:56.240 --> 43:02.320
your mind from it. And if the mind is free on the level of the other reason states of

43:02.320 --> 43:08.360
unwholesome nature, then the mind cannot be controlled, touched or engaged with the states

43:08.360 --> 43:16.880
that are actually right in front of you for a reason. And the maintenance of wholesome

43:16.880 --> 43:24.280
states. Again, it's again easy in regards to the unwholesome state. The possibility of

43:24.280 --> 43:28.200
the wholesome state, that's what you're training in regard to. And that's how you maintain

43:28.200 --> 43:36.760
the actual reason wholesome states. As seen in a danger, seeing the precise gratification.

43:36.760 --> 43:43.080
Well, see the danger in being liable to the arising of the unwholesome states of unwholesome

43:43.080 --> 43:52.280
nature. See the danger in the possibility of unwholesome affecting you.

43:52.280 --> 43:58.560
You actually gratification. And the sure, in there is a month. Yeah. Yeah. Would you be

43:58.560 --> 44:05.560
deriving the possibility of unwholesome? Delighting. Well, not in a sensual manner. In order

44:05.560 --> 44:11.760
to welcome. Well, not deriving is the also. Yeah, exactly. You might want it, but then

44:11.760 --> 44:16.840
wanting will be on the level of wisdom. Like wanting eyes and recognizing this is liberation,

44:16.840 --> 44:23.840
this is the free, this is escape. Yeah, chandelier. Yeah, exactly. You can go both ways. See.
