00:00.000 --> 00:22.880
I had a couple of thoughts.

00:22.880 --> 00:30.240
One thing I thought about was a heedfulness or diligence. They're translated in different

00:30.240 --> 00:41.520
ways. So the quality that the Buddha says is where all skillful qualities converge and

00:41.520 --> 00:56.880
is the way to not decline in the Dhamma. So what is it? And who does it apply to? Where

00:56.880 --> 01:13.480
does it start? Anybody else want to say something? So the heedfulness, so can somebody without

01:13.480 --> 01:26.320
the right view, be heedful? No. In a common sense, yes. Whatever you want to achieve,

01:26.320 --> 01:31.880
you have to be heedful. So it actually applies even before. In a sense that if you recognize

01:31.880 --> 01:36.840
that it is your task to develop the right view and then you are heedful in regard to

01:36.840 --> 01:43.800
that task, it is the heedfulness that will make you seek the right view. And then obviously

01:43.800 --> 01:49.000
once you have the right view, that heedfulness will make you develop it further. So that's

01:49.000 --> 01:54.720
why the Buddha singled it out as the soul factor, because he would actually pertain to

01:54.720 --> 01:58.720
somebody from the moment of hearing about the possibility of freedom from suffering to

01:58.720 --> 02:02.160
the moment of understanding the freedom from suffering and then fully developing it. If

02:02.160 --> 02:12.640
he is heedful, he would find a way. Will that alone make him find a way? No, of course not.

02:12.640 --> 02:18.560
That's why you can be heedful, but if you don't come across the right instruction, if

02:18.560 --> 02:26.560
you don't attend to it rightly, you won't. You won't get the right view. It seems to

02:26.560 --> 02:32.080
me there is a difference, something of a difference in what would constitute heedfulness, like

02:32.080 --> 02:38.400
you'd be heedful in regard to what for somebody without the right view, as opposed to being

02:38.400 --> 02:42.520
heedful in regard to what should be. So what should a person without a right view be heedful

02:42.520 --> 02:54.120
about? What I was thinking was mainly, well, heedful of the peril of not having the right

02:54.120 --> 03:02.560
view or knowing that you're heedful of the fact that you're not sot upon it, and take

03:02.560 --> 03:12.520
that seriously in that sense. So if a person is heedful about it, they won't slack the

03:12.520 --> 03:18.520
effort. They won't sort of fall into the assumption that they know that which they don't, and

03:18.520 --> 03:23.480
so on, because they would constantly be heedful about the fact that, well, am I free from

03:23.480 --> 03:29.360
the first three fetters? Do I see the Four Noble Truths? Am I my own guide? Do I need

03:29.360 --> 03:34.320
to defend my views? Am I beyond doubt all of that? It's like, no, no, no, no, no. Well,

03:34.320 --> 03:40.600
then I'm not there yet, so I should remain heedful. So in other words, heedful would

03:40.600 --> 03:46.520
pretty much stand for being, at that stage, would stand, actually at any stage, would

03:46.520 --> 03:53.360
stand for being honest and authentic. So a sot upon a sakkadagam yanagami should also

03:53.360 --> 04:00.760
be heedful of the fact that they still have work to do. So it would be the same principle.

04:00.760 --> 04:07.520
And it's a bit like mindfulness. You can't have too much.

04:07.520 --> 04:14.680
Exactly. Exactly. Which I think it's hard sometimes translated as well, kind of synonymously.

04:14.680 --> 04:20.680
But yeah, you can't be too heedful of the fact that you don't have the right view or

04:20.680 --> 04:27.800
of the fact that you're not on the other hand yet and so on. That will keep you practicing

04:27.800 --> 04:37.240
and directed towards the practice. So it seems to me that heedfulness also refers somewhat

04:37.240 --> 04:46.280
not only to specific things you do, but like the extent to which you do them, not only

04:46.280 --> 04:50.560
in the sense of how intensely, let's say, you practice, if you, I don't know, you could

04:50.560 --> 04:57.600
do extremely intense, trying to think about things and contemplate things and be as always,

04:57.600 --> 05:02.160
you didn't do everything right for half a day, but if the rest of the day you're not,

05:02.160 --> 05:09.000
yeah, yeah, sure. That constitutes just acting out of overly determined mind, which sure,

05:09.000 --> 05:16.320
if you know what you're determining, it can be beneficial, but in and of itself, yeah.

05:16.320 --> 05:21.080
It's not where heedfulness is on the level of mindfulness, context, recollecting your

05:21.080 --> 05:26.440
situation, what are you still subjected to, what are the, can the non-reason lust arise,

05:26.440 --> 05:32.920
can the non-reason anger arise, can the non-reason hindrances hinder you, all of that is reflected

05:32.920 --> 05:37.800
through on a kind of heedfulness. Well, let me actually be careful and check these things.

05:37.800 --> 05:44.560
I might be fine now, but do I know for sure I will remain fine in the future if circumstances

05:44.560 --> 05:57.720
change, if things change, and so on. And then keeping that in mind, not slackening

05:57.720 --> 06:06.600
in regard to it, in the sense that, you know, you can't think, oh, I'll just do this for

06:06.600 --> 06:12.280
a certain amount of time and then I'll take a break. It has to be basically done up to

06:12.280 --> 06:18.520
the point, up to the extent necessary. Yeah, you can, you can take a break from the individual

06:18.520 --> 06:24.360
determinations of, I'll do this or I'll do that, if it's too much, if it's too tight,

06:24.360 --> 06:27.560
but there is never a reason to take a break from heedfulness, inasmuch there's never

06:27.560 --> 06:31.720
a reason to take a break from mindfulness. It's exactly the same, the same thing.

06:31.720 --> 06:37.880
Can I take a break now? Yeah. Is there a danger of me taking a break now?

06:37.880 --> 06:43.040
So I can take a relative break in a sense of I mustn't forget that, yeah, there's still

06:43.040 --> 06:46.800
work to be done. So sure, I need to catch my breath. You can't just keep going in the

06:46.800 --> 06:53.840
same pace. But that, that needs to be understood that heedfulness and mindfulness, there is

06:53.840 --> 07:00.600
never a reason or a justification to take a break from. So to that extent, you should

07:00.600 --> 07:08.120
never rest, because if your rest requires you to, to ignore heedfulness and mindfulness,

07:08.120 --> 07:12.800
means it's a rest of essential distracting kind, for sure.

07:12.800 --> 07:22.880
It's like, um, craving always leads to suffering. So there's never a situation where like relaxing

07:22.880 --> 07:30.840
and, unless you're completely free from it, yeah, then relaxing it would mean inducing

07:30.840 --> 07:38.280
it. So relaxing from heedfulness and mindfulness so that, like a general sort of enduring memory

07:38.280 --> 07:44.400
of your situation, of your liabilities, of all of that, that gives rise to identification,

07:44.400 --> 07:49.000
personality view, craving, everything else. That is already there, underlying tendencies,

07:49.000 --> 07:59.000
thinking for things to become suitable for them to appear. So mindfulness, that's what

07:59.000 --> 08:06.800
mindfulness is, the path to that deftlessness, to freedom from all of it. And it's, it's,

08:06.800 --> 08:13.680
it's kind of learning how to be heedful and mindful without needing to do it on account

08:13.680 --> 08:17.800
of your determination and inspiration, because then when those things are gone, your heedfulness

08:17.800 --> 08:22.720
and mindfulness is gone, and then you're back pretty much in the perilous state of sensuality

08:22.720 --> 08:29.680
and liabilities, because they are, if they're fully understood, or at least initially understood

08:29.680 --> 08:34.240
correctly, you would get a hint that they are truly effortless. So you don't need to

08:34.240 --> 08:37.720
rest from something that doesn't require effort.

08:37.720 --> 08:44.040
Then does that mindfulness, that heedfulness become effortless?

08:44.040 --> 08:48.120
By understanding it, understanding the nature of it.

08:48.120 --> 08:56.240
And what factor is the, allows it to be effortless? So you cannot understand it. Mindfulness is

08:56.240 --> 09:03.040
this, heedfulness is that, but there's another factor which, if you see, you are automatically

09:03.040 --> 09:07.640
careful, if you develop it automatically.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.040
Well, like you also, you only want to see God.

09:10.040 --> 09:14.480
Yeah, we'll see the danger. See the danger, yeah. Attending to it rightly.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.320
There are snakes in this forest.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.480
Knowledge of that makes you heedful.

09:20.480 --> 09:25.520
Yeah, so you're always remembering, oh yeah, snakes, oh yeah, if I get bitten by a snake.

09:25.520 --> 09:32.120
Yeah, so that's why, like again, mindfulness established correctly, invested effort in,

09:32.120 --> 09:35.560
in that sense, like you do need to initially make the effort to recollect the context and

09:35.560 --> 09:40.320
protect the context, but yeah, it gives rise to knowledge, to the recognition of certain

09:40.320 --> 09:45.800
universal principles, and exactly the dangers, how to attend to these things without losing

09:45.800 --> 09:50.520
the sight of the danger and so on.

09:50.520 --> 09:57.200
And that is the, you know, like the, the, the famous practice of Anapanasati, it's really

09:57.200 --> 10:01.640
not a meditation practice, it's a practice of mindfulness, which of course, is a meditation

10:01.640 --> 10:05.880
itself, but not the way people usually think.

10:05.880 --> 10:12.080
So the whole, the whole idea of, of these types of cultivation, the Satipatanas, the

10:12.080 --> 10:19.120
Anapanasati, is just to permeate all the aspects of your experience with the same recollectiveness

10:19.120 --> 10:21.160
and same heedfulness.

10:21.160 --> 10:28.920
So in regards to body, feeling, states of mind, and thoughts.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.760
So in other words, when I'm trying to say, even when people sometimes have this determination

10:32.760 --> 10:38.940
to practice meditation, they don't realize that Anapanasati does not lead you to the

10:38.940 --> 10:43.880
absorptions and experience of pleasantly blissive Jan or whatever you perceive it to be.

10:43.880 --> 10:51.560
It actually leads you to being incapable of becoming unmindful and unheedful, so to speak.

10:51.560 --> 10:56.520
So yes, if you have a determination to practice meditation, practice the same heedfulness

10:56.520 --> 11:01.720
and mindfulness, sure, want a kind of knowledge of your breath, knowledge of your own sense

11:01.720 --> 11:04.680
of self-breeding like this, breathing like that, doesn't matter, knowledge of how you

11:04.680 --> 11:10.280
feel while you breathe, or while you are kind of walking, extending your limbs, eating,

11:10.280 --> 11:17.080
dwelling in solitude, basically, all of these things are there as your situation, as the

11:17.080 --> 11:25.400
basis, the form, the feeling, all of that, and all you need to do is learn how to see

11:25.400 --> 11:35.240
them, discern them, be mindful and heedful in regard to them without needing to do them,

11:35.240 --> 11:41.960
and without forgetting about them either, so that's the tuning of the strings.

11:41.960 --> 11:51.000
So in regard to that, there is this, let's say, subtle but kind of important distinction

11:51.000 --> 11:57.240
that you need to learn how to see them and discern them, then you need to be heedful

11:57.240 --> 11:58.920
in regard to them.

11:58.920 --> 12:05.880
So there is a point where you need to kind of balance or stop trying to see and discern

12:05.880 --> 12:06.880
them.

12:06.880 --> 12:11.320
And that balance would be the beginning of correct heedfulness and mindfulness.

12:11.320 --> 12:16.160
That balance would be the beginning of correct Samadhi, where you're not overly concentrating

12:16.160 --> 12:22.280
and trying to do it, do it, but at the same time, you're incapable of forgetting it.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.560
So it's effortless.

12:24.560 --> 12:33.440
And that point where you say, okay, this is where I just need to be heedful, like, okay,

12:33.440 --> 12:36.600
these are the snakes in this forest, like you said.

12:36.600 --> 12:42.920
Now that is dangerous, I recognize that, so now let me just keep being heedful in regard

12:42.920 --> 12:53.120
to that, but the mind tends to keep wanting, no, no, no, I need to keep, you know, how

12:53.120 --> 12:59.320
can I be sure that this is enough, basically, how can I, so...

12:59.320 --> 13:00.320
Mind tends to overdo it.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.320
Yeah.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.320
Wanting to keep doing it, overtighten it, overdo it.

13:04.320 --> 13:11.080
Or dismiss the whole thing, I'll run away from this forest, but that's impossible either.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.800
So you realize, well, you can try to run away, which always resulted in you returning back

13:14.800 --> 13:19.640
in the forest and getting bitten by snakes, because you didn't discern them sufficiently

13:19.640 --> 13:25.920
enough where the dangers are, or exactly becoming overly invested in discerning even stuff that

13:25.920 --> 13:28.960
you don't really need to discern in that sense.

13:28.960 --> 13:36.000
So knowing where to stop, knowing to recognize where that kind of middle ground is, that

13:36.000 --> 13:42.800
then if you dwell on, invest in, protect, it can grow, but not if you over-tighten,

13:42.800 --> 13:46.840
or if it's too loose either.

13:46.840 --> 13:59.760
Because is it a snake example, you know, walking people who would know they're snakes and then

13:59.760 --> 14:04.640
be hitting the ground constantly with a stick as you're walking through the forest and you

14:04.640 --> 14:10.000
just, but, and then when something happens, like there's danger, there's danger somewhere,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.720
you know, there's insects, there's snakes, there's this, there's this disease everywhere.

14:14.720 --> 14:20.200
And then when something, was that the bat, was that the rabies, was that the disease

14:20.200 --> 14:22.280
of that I'm waiting for?

14:22.280 --> 14:27.520
So you just completely, as if you were already bitten, you don't, you've gone too far, too

14:27.520 --> 14:33.400
tight in your, you're careful, but you've lost it, you've lost the context, you've lost

14:33.400 --> 14:39.000
the plot completely, and then if something does really bite you, you're done.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.920
So yeah, you need to have that balance and see, okay, there is no, there's nothing here,

14:46.920 --> 14:51.600
you have a context, there's nothing biting you, so you can, then you can walk through

14:51.600 --> 14:53.320
the forest barefoot.

14:53.320 --> 14:58.800
To be able to basically kind of draw a line for yourself as to how far you will allow

14:58.800 --> 14:59.800
to act out.

14:59.800 --> 15:06.120
Okay, so there are pile of leaves here, you know, huntiners might be hiding in it, so

15:06.120 --> 15:10.200
let me sweep it, but that doesn't mean now, for the rest of my time in the forest, I will

15:10.200 --> 15:12.000
walk with a broom everywhere.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.120
No, if it looks too, I avoid it, if it doesn't, it's all right.

15:16.120 --> 15:21.480
But if you start giving in, to know I'll sweep this and I'll sweep it, means you started

15:21.480 --> 15:27.160
acting out of fear and concern, and then you are losing perspective, which means now you

15:27.160 --> 15:28.160
are even more exposed.

15:28.160 --> 15:33.440
So basically, the more you act out towards defending what you obviously implicitly took

15:33.440 --> 15:39.440
as valuable and yours, well, the wider the basis of the danger that you're applicable

15:39.440 --> 15:41.080
to becomes.

15:41.080 --> 15:47.720
That's that, that, that monk that was in the arhant in the suttas, well, people didn't

15:47.720 --> 15:50.840
know he was an arhant, going around the forest saying, oh, what a pleasure, what a joy, what

15:50.840 --> 15:51.840
a bliss.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.920
And they thought, oh, he must be remembering his former wives or something.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.000
So they went and told the Buddha, they would have called him, says, what do you refer to

15:58.000 --> 15:59.720
when you talk about his pleasure and the bliss?

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
Is it previous sensuality?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.480
It's like, no, no, no, no, no, quite the opposite.

16:02.480 --> 16:07.640
He was a prince having five causes of sensual bliss, but constantly fearing for his life,

16:07.640 --> 16:12.600
whether his wives were killing or his relatives or his parents, because he was basically in

16:12.600 --> 16:14.560
line for the throne or whatever.

16:14.560 --> 16:18.480
So he was, he had all the guards and all the palaces, but he could never have a moment

16:18.480 --> 16:23.160
to peace, because he was just, the more he was defending himself and all the possible

16:23.160 --> 16:28.160
permutations of the danger and the attacks, the more vulnerable he was becoming internally.

16:28.160 --> 16:33.080
He was being attacked by, that's already a form of fear, you're already being attacked.

16:33.080 --> 16:38.880
And then when he abandoned the entire ownership, identity, craving, became an arhant, he said,

16:38.880 --> 16:43.800
now I live in this forest with his factual dangers, tiger's, elephant's, snakes, yet

16:43.800 --> 16:46.240
I have no slightest concern for my life.

16:46.240 --> 16:51.600
And whenever he remembers how he used to live his home, I go, what a pleasure, this is now.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.640
Like immeasurable safety amidst the danger.

16:55.640 --> 17:03.680
And it starts by not acting out, it starts by not really going out of your way to defend

17:03.680 --> 17:06.280
and address all the possible, suffering will land on you.

17:06.280 --> 17:10.400
So use common sense, as those other suitors say, like, okay, well, there's a clearly raging

17:10.400 --> 17:16.440
elephant or a group of bandits or something, okay, avoid it until you're an arhant, then

17:16.440 --> 17:19.320
you'll know what to do or what not to do.

17:19.320 --> 17:23.760
But that doesn't mean you're not justified to be like, well, maybe this, maybe this,

17:23.760 --> 17:31.400
or this, but theater here, this is, yeah, it might be.

17:31.400 --> 17:39.760
So like the highest safety is not needing any protection.

17:39.760 --> 17:47.320
But until you reach that point, it is that heedfulness that is kind of your refuge, if

17:47.320 --> 17:56.320
you discern it correctly, like seeing how far the, seeing the danger in, well, in things

17:56.320 --> 18:01.720
that are impermanent and things that are suffering in the nature of things that you would usually

18:01.720 --> 18:09.800
like to depend on, then the only thing that you can depend on is your heedfulness, basically.

18:09.800 --> 18:14.640
Well, the thing that you, that you can't ultimately depend on that will lead you to

18:14.640 --> 18:16.960
not needing to depend on anything.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.480
You're becoming negligent, that's it.

18:20.480 --> 18:27.440
And the more that you dwell on, see that's, yeah, the one with the right view, if you

18:27.440 --> 18:36.160
dwell on the nature of impermanence, nature of suffering, that naturally the mind turns

18:36.160 --> 18:41.960
towards seeing danger in acting negligently in regard to that, or becoming, or heedless

18:41.960 --> 18:44.960
in regard to that, forgetting that.

18:44.960 --> 18:51.320
So it's like you don't need to do anything more, or extra, or, yeah, just within that,

18:51.320 --> 18:56.560
you need to start finding subtler ways that you're still not heedful enough.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.560
Yeah, exactly.

18:57.560 --> 19:02.080
Because obviously, if heedfulness is seen thoroughly, developed thoroughly, you'll be

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
an unhunt.

19:03.080 --> 19:06.760
The fact that you're not means, okay, so I'm heedful overall.

19:06.760 --> 19:11.680
But within this heedfulness, there are obviously things that still resort to heedlessly.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.680
Yes.

19:12.680 --> 19:18.480
There are not of, you know, core central kind and so on, but are still obstacles.

19:18.480 --> 19:27.280
That's why it's hard to do is, the thing is not to, like, to have one particular moment

19:27.280 --> 19:34.800
of insight or something, but to develop this completely, to thoroughly do it.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.800
It's not only...

19:35.800 --> 19:37.800
Yeah, to keep at it, basically.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
It doesn't matter.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.800
Until it's done.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.800
Until it's done, just, yeah.

19:43.800 --> 19:57.480
And one way of staying heedful could be to see where do I seek gratification and see

19:57.480 --> 20:00.360
the danger in those places.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.600
Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.760
Because that's why a mind would still be seeking gratification in those places, because you

20:06.760 --> 20:10.360
haven't actually stopped and thought about, wait a minute, but that is dangerous.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.160
That pertains to the same principle that I'm trying to abandon.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.400
That is not for my good.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.400
That's for my harm.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.400
That's for the harm of others.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.200
So I should better avoid it.

20:18.200 --> 20:37.160
And consider this, it will be easier to recognize it, and then restrain it.
