1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,600
So this is from the shorter note on Dhamma.

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,160
The word Dhamma, in its most general sense, is equivalent to thing, i.e. whatever is distinct

3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,160
from anything else, more precisely, is what the thing is in itself, as opposed to how it

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,440
is in the footnote to that reads, how a thing is a matter of structure, that is to say of

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,360
intentions, chaitana, or determinations, sankara.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:58,760
These are essentially negative, whereas Dhamma is positive.

7
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:10,120
So in terms of that, he's distinguishing what a thing is, versus how a thing is, but it may

8
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,760
not be obvious that those are two things that can be distinguished in the first place, so

9
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
to speak.

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,960
I was wondering if you had anything to comment or add about how you would discern a thing

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,200
from its determinations, so to speak.

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:38,560
Well, okay, so that's where you only saw Manasakara comes in, basically knowing how to attend

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,920
a thing without making it another thing, without making it a different thing.

14
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,000
So in this particular passage you read, Dhamma is anything that has a nature to manifest

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,040
itself.

16
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,640
So a feeling, a thought, a perception, a memory, it doesn't matter.

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,680
If it's a reason experience as such, it's a thing, it's a Dhamma.

18
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:14,400
So you will discern then what that thing is determined by simultaneously being able to

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
discern what's present there within that thing that it isn't that thing.

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:30,040
Now the problem is this requires quite a refined, as in proper way, of attending to the fundamental

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,720
core of the arisen thing.

22
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,840
That's why Journeys, Manasakara, Journeys, so literally means womb, means going back

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,520
to the womb, attending to the womb of the arisen thing, that it's simultaneously their

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,680
present, attending to its base.

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
That's what proper attention means in the suttas.

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
The problem that people have is if that proper attention is not developed and trained and

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,720
discerned, what you're going to do is when there is a, say, a thing A has arisen, instead

28
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:04,240
of seeing through it into not A, still within A, but not that A, people, when they look,

29
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,800
they overlook, so then they see B, and B is just another thing.

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,320
And when they look for the Sankara for the determination of the experience B, well they

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,240
see C, which means they're not seeing these things simultaneously present, they're following

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,920
them in time, they're following them linearly or logically.

33
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,720
And that's why they can't understand the true nature of Sankara, because if a person

34
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,920
would understand that, that's the beginning of Patitsang Pada.

35
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,160
So the present experience of such and such nature, without abandoning that experience,

36
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,280
without over-intending it, without under-intending it, you want to discern peripherally in regard

37
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,960
to the present experience, what else is there?

38
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,240
That's what I meant in the previous video about Kama, when I said the intentionality

39
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,160
behind your actions, the degree of those intentions it's given beforehand as options,

40
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,200
and that's not what you're doing, nor it is your responsibility.

41
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,120
Not being able to see it on that level, you will automatically appropriate it, overly

42
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,880
intended, which means make it mine, which means result in acting out of it.

43
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,640
So if you want to discern the determination of the present, there is an experience of

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,480
Dama, you need to see it within that present experience of Dama.

45
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,040
That's why every Patitsang Pada starts with this, this is, with two simultaneous present

46
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,960
things, because yes, when you look at Sankara's individually, not in the context of determining

47
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,120
Dama, there are also things, which means there are also Damas, as the Buddha described that,

48
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,160
when he was describing the five aggregates.

49
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,800
But you don't want to look for the content of Sankara, or the content of Dama, you want

50
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,560
to see the relationship between Dama, and that which determines it, which is not Dama,

51
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,960
that particular Dama.

52
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,920
So you want to see the relationship between A, and that which is simultaneously present,

53
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,800
that it's not that A, but not B either.

54
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,320
So by not giving into A, but not making it into B, by not confusing the two, you get

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,480
to understand how A is presently determined, presently a reason with presently a reason

56
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,840
causes as well.

57
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,720
And that's why when they ask the Buddha, he says, how did you cross, he said, you can't

58
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,880
cross the shore by fighting the waves, by pulling backwards, by standing still.

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,000
So how did you cross the shores, by not fighting the waves, by not pulling backwards, by not

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,560
standing still?

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,280
He has crossed the stream, the river.

62
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,880
But the problem people have is, because it's a form of fighting the wave, over intending

63
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
it.

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,800
Because there is in Dama A, I look for its cause as in I'm looking for B, to determine

65
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
A.

66
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,520
And that's what most people misunderstood, but it's own bother.

67
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,080
They think it's an explanation of the life of the three life stages and so on.

68
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,400
They think it's laid out in time from A, B, C, D, E, E, F, G, and so on.

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
But it isn't.

70
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,120
It's always, always starts with the present there isn't principle of with this, this

71
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
is, that's it.

72
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,160
And then the Buddha would elaborate differently within the same principle, depending on who

73
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
he was teaching.

74
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,360
But sometimes, but it's a part of describing twelve factors, sometimes in eight, sometimes

75
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
in sixteen, it doesn't matter.

76
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,880
What matters is, the simultaneous principle, the principle of simultaneous dependence.

77
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,520
And if you want to see what A depends upon, you can't look for B, you have to look within

78
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
A, which it is a name.

79
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,320
So it's about letting Dama's endure and then not looking elsewhere.

80
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,840
No trying to explain the Dama, as, no trying to explain there is a thing, but allowing

81
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,880
it to arise and allowing it to persist and endure and while it persists and endures,

82
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,160
you get to see what else is there within it that determines it.

83
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,880
And that's not that Dama, it's some kind of that Dama.

84
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,200
But if you look at B, well then you need to look now to, to find its own Sankara within

85
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,400
that B, not like start drawing connections between A and B and then provide an explanation

86
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,960
to yourself what the determination is.

87
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:33,880
So this is going on to the next paragraph now, so it's Sabei Sankara Nitya, Sabei Sankara

88
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,000
Nitya, Sabei Dama Anata.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,400
All determinations are impermanence, all determinations are unpleasurable, all things are not self.

90
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:55,800
Ata self is fundamentally a notion of mastery over things, but this notion is entertained

91
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,880
only if it is pleasurable, it is only pleasurable provided the mastery is soon be permanent

92
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:08,120
for mastery, which is essentially a kind of absolute timelessness unmoved moving of things

93
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,520
as undermined by impermanence is no mastery at all but a mockery.

94
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,760
Thus regarding of a thing, A-Dama as Ata or self can survive for only as so long as the

95
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,520
notion gives pleasure and it only gives pleasure for so long as that Dama can be considered

96
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,400
as permanent for regarding a thing as self and dows it with the illusion of the kind of

97
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,440
super stability in time.

98
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,760
In itself as a Dama regarded as Ata, its impermanence is not manifest for it is pleasant

99
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,680
to consider it as permanent, but when it is seen to be dependent upon other Dama, not

100
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,280
considered to be permanent, its impermanence does then become manifest.

101
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,840
To see impermanence in what is regarded as Ata, one must emerge from the confines of

102
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,780
the individual Dama itself and see that it depends on what is impermanence, thus Sabe

103
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:07,440
Sankara, Nattana, Anicha is said, meaning all things that things Dama depend on are

104
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
impermanent.

105
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,840
A given Dama as a Dama regarded as Ata is not account to being so regarded, considered

106
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,360
to be pleasant, but when it is seen to be dependent upon some other Dama that not being

107
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,120
regarded as Ata is manifestly unpleasurable owing to the invariable false perception

108
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,440
of impermanence of super stability in one not free from the conceit I am, then its own

109
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,880
unpleasurableness becomes manifest, thus Sabe Sankara, Nattana, Nuka is said, when this

110
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,960
is seen, i.e. when perception of permanence and pleasure is understood to be false, the

111
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:53,800
notion this Dama is my Ata comes to an end and is replaced with Sabe, Dama and Ata.

112
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,960
So before you ask the question, just to add to that, that's a commonly kind of mis-misread

113
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,840
with people say, oh yeah, the Buddha said all things are impermanent, all things are suffering,

114
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
all things are not self.

115
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:14,720
That's what I mean when you kind of overly intend and basically use Dama that ends up

116
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,400
being an explanation, just provides an explanation that everything is impermanent and everything

117
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,080
is not yours and everything is not yourself.

118
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,000
But if you read, if you look at the Pali, it doesn't say that, it says all the terminations

119
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,920
are impermanent, all the terminations are suffering, all things are not self.

120
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,240
So that's what I was discussing just a few seconds ago, that difference in the simultaneous

121
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,680
the present things on a different level, as in the present Dama, present self is determined

122
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,480
by present things that are within it that cannot be the self at the same time.

123
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,960
So go on now.

124
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:08,080
In simpler terms, if a person can make a contemplation out of it, again, to do general things, things

125
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,160
are mine because I am, but it's out of the way around.

126
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,400
It's because you keep taking things to be for me, you keep assuming that you are.

127
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:26,280
So appropriation of as mine comes first, structurally, not temporary, which means you can't have

128
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,880
sense of self without a sense of ownership being present there, simultaneously with that

129
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,040
sense of self.

130
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,680
And that's why for somebody who has understood the Dama sort of on a higher, they have abandoned

131
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,560
that Atavada, but they still have a degree of conceit, they would respond to a degree

132
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,800
of appropriation that they still maintain in regard to things, but ultimately, of course,

133
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,480
they're heading towards complete freedom from it.

134
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,600
So in practical terms, if a person wants to contemplate, just take your body, for example,

135
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,920
don't take some random objects because you might, well, it's a subtle thing to understand,

136
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,080
so you want to try as accurate as possible, you want to start as accurate as possible,

137
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,600
and the most accurate, the most factual thing that you have is your body.

138
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,520
And that is something, your senses, that is something that everybody automatically appropriates

139
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,800
in regards to his mind, and things that I am.

140
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,280
Like I can see here taste touch because I am, it's actually out of the way around, it's

141
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,400
because you keep seeing, hear me tasting, touching your song, you think you are, as in

142
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,160
you think you are the owner of that.

143
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,680
So if a person wants to undermine that sense, you can't just start explaining to yourself

144
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,840
that this body is impermanent and use like medical jargon and so on, because it assumes

145
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,440
this external point of view, no, you need to feel that impermanence right through the

146
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,880
heart of that ownership, and how you do it, you do it by allowing the ownership to arise.

147
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,080
This body right here, that's present right now, sitting on the chair, talking to you,

148
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,520
answering your questions.

149
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,080
Can I have this present body here answering questions, sitting on the chair in this forest?

150
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,000
Can I do that without this simultaneous muscle inside of my chest, the heart beating and

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,360
pumping blood, without oxygen being pumped around my body, would I be able to operate?

152
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,440
Without my lungs being able to breathe air, would I be able to operate?

153
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,640
I wouldn't, which means any sense of ownership, master intentionality that I might exhibit

154
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,640
is directly determined, simultaneously determined, or rather determined by the simultaneous

155
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,200
presence of these other functioning things that I cannot control, because you can't

156
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,880
even conceive how it would be to tell your heart to stop, and it would be just completely

157
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
involuntary.

158
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,120
It's an involuntary muscle, which means it just works on its own, yet your whole life

159
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
depends upon it.

160
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,080
Now many people might think that, contemplate the heart and impermanence of it, but you

161
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,200
don't want to contemplate it, as I said before, after or before, you want to contemplate it

162
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,240
right through the present thing of this appropriation of this body.

163
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,640
In another video I was talking about, like the simile, the simile of the chariot, how

164
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,960
people say, it's made out of parts, that is not real.

165
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,720
No, you want to see the parts through the existing phenomenon of the whole.

166
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,280
So the contemplation of body parts will work only, as in it will result in dispassion and

167
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:26,240
freedom from suffering, and this owning of your own body and your own sense of self,

168
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,920
which means it will result in anata, contemplation of parts will result in that, if you see it

169
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,160
within the presently arisen basis of this appropriated body.

170
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,120
So this body that I am, this sentence that I'm talking, this situation that I'm in control

171
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,960
of, can be undermined at any second by the beating heart if it stops to pump, that's

172
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
it.

173
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:57,600
I cannot continue existing if these parts that comprise this entire body, if these parts,

174
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,280
if they stop functioning, if they are dismembered, if they fail, none of which you can control.

175
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,480
So recognition of that, of those determinations of those parts, recognition of that, it's,

176
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
they are basically impermanent.

177
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Why?

178
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,720
Because you know, they might be working now, but they cannot possibly work like this in

179
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,800
this particular arrangement forever, it's just inconceivable.

180
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,840
So that's the first recognition of impermanence, which then in itself, well this, this cannot

181
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,680
be pleasurable, because pleasant notion is the notion of eternity, it's going to be unchanged

182
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,040
forever, stable.

183
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,040
And if you experienced the heart of your ownership as impermanent and unpleasurable, you disown

184
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
it automatically.

185
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,360
That's also another thing I want to say.

186
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,200
So a person who starts discerning Sabes, Sankara, Anicia, Sabes, Sankara, Dooka, they

187
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,000
don't need to then go in our case, or Saba, Dama, Anata.

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,880
No, their experience will automatically become Dama, Anata, Saba, Dama, Anata.

189
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,120
It will be automatically experienced as not my self.

190
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,640
This sense of self, this body, this situation, by being actually fundamentally rooted in

191
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,560
that which is completely outside of my reach or control, undermines the ownership of this

192
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
very situation.

193
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,840
Thus, situation remains unchanged in a way, but then everything changes because the ownership

194
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
of it has been removed.

195
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,600
That's why Arahant cannot be necessarily recognized externally.

196
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,880
He still acts, talks, and does stuff normally like everybody else does.

197
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,280
But there is no ownership of any part of that.

198
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,080
Thus, there is no any conceit or sense of self.

199
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:45,520
So as a girl, as the example you gave of seeing your bodily situation that you find yourself

200
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,240
in, determined by the presence of, let's say, the heart.

201
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,120
What is the way to bring your mind to this without making the presence of your heart

202
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,080
a B, as we said before?

203
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Yeah, exactly.

204
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,760
Without overattending it, and then making a presence of your heart another thing that

205
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,280
now you're not seeing that the relationship of the termination anymore.

206
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,840
Well, the thing is, again, you must not become a mindful of how you feel in this present

207
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,200
situation.

208
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,160
So the present situation being felt, right here, right now, to this extent, pleasant

209
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:31,600
and pleasant neutral, and then just start not allowing your mind to approach the notion

210
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,680
of a pumping heart as a determination, not allow your mind to approach it as an afterthought

211
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:44,640
or as before or as maybe as an explanation, but actually go through that situation that's

212
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,000
being felt.

213
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,840
And for most people, it's going to result in anxiety and concern, which is the inevitable

214
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
beginning.

215
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,560
That's why in the suit as you did when people came to the Buddha and they asked him, what

216
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
is he teaching?

217
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,440
He would explain the notself when they would fall on the ground beating their breast and

218
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,920
pulling their hair in despair.

219
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,360
That's because they generally understood what he was teaching.

220
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,760
But obviously, they did not let go of the notion of self, hence they experienced terror

221
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,640
and they started, they would shout or this will kill us, this will destroy us, this will

222
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,440
obliterate us, because they did actually understand what he was referring to.

223
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,200
So then they misunderstood something, you wouldn't be that afraid.

224
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,160
That's why Sila needs to come first, mindfulness and restraining the danger in the slightest

225
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,280
fault, because they will keep you together from falling onto the ground and beating your

226
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,200
breast and becoming desperate.

227
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,320
So is that that's in a matter of the only so much, far of determining that way to...

228
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,840
Determining the presently, determining the present determination within the present there

229
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,440
isn't a thing.

230
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,400
So while the thing is present, you determine the determination within it.

231
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,560
Not before or after.

232
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:07,320
So while this body here, which is automatically taken is mine, without overthinking, without

233
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,840
making a separate experience of a thought of my pumping heart, but stay with the thought

234
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,400
of this present experience, peripherally, I discerned dependence that this experience

235
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,160
has upon a random beating muscle of a heart, heart muscle, that's it.

236
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,360
And then you'll feel it, you'll start feeling it.

237
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:38,880
And when you start feeling it, you'll know you're doing it right.
