00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
So can a lay lifestyle lead to becoming an arahant?

00:06.000 --> 00:09.520
A lay lifestyle, no. No, that's impossible.

00:09.520 --> 00:15.520
The question, yeah, that's often asked, is can a layman be an arahant?

00:15.520 --> 00:19.600
But that depends what's meant by layman. If you mean that somebody

00:19.600 --> 00:25.440
is not a formal ordain, doesn't wear robes, then yes, a layman can become an

00:25.440 --> 00:33.040
arahant. But if by a layman you mean by taking in the lifestyle of a layman,

00:33.040 --> 00:38.640
living in company, still having concerns with the world,

00:38.640 --> 00:43.040
living a household life, not being sensory-strained, that's impossible.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.920
So from that point of view, a layman cannot be an arahant.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.320
That's when the suit is a layman, as in a person not ordained in the big order,

00:50.320 --> 00:53.920
but became an arahant. He wasn't a householder,

00:53.920 --> 00:57.200
who became an arahant. He was a person who wasn't ordained, but wasn't living

00:57.200 --> 01:01.440
as a householder either. So the most famous case is Bahia,

01:01.440 --> 01:07.840
who himself was a naked, a buddhbhak ascetic. He was just waiting buddhbhak

01:07.840 --> 01:11.920
to cover himself, and he was living very austerely,

01:11.920 --> 01:16.000
mindfully, practicing for who knows how long, and he was so pure that

01:16.000 --> 01:19.680
he himself thought he's fully enlightened. And then the devout of

01:19.680 --> 01:23.200
compassion said, no, actually not fully enlightened, go and meet the Buddha.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.520
And that's the famous instruction where the Buddha, all he needed to say to him,

01:27.520 --> 01:30.560
was in the scene, let there just be the scene, in the herd,

01:30.560 --> 01:33.440
let there just be the herd, and so on, for all the senses.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.800
And he became an arahant. So technically he was a layman, he wasn't

01:36.800 --> 01:39.680
he wasn't a monk, he wasn't an ordain, because then he asked the Buddha,

01:39.680 --> 01:43.680
oh, can I join your order? He said, yeah, go and find the ball and the rope,

01:43.680 --> 01:48.720
but then he got killed by a cow. So technically he was a layman who became

01:48.720 --> 01:52.080
an arahant, but you realize he was far from

01:52.080 --> 01:55.680
living a layman's life. He was basically a type of

01:55.680 --> 01:59.360
summoner, an ascetic, just not ordained in the order.

01:59.360 --> 02:03.520
And often that's where the lines get blurred. People say, oh, so you don't

02:03.520 --> 02:06.960
need to be a monk, as in you don't need to be formally ordained

02:06.960 --> 02:10.800
to become an arahant, means I can live a household life

02:10.800 --> 02:14.960
and become an arahant. No, you need to live like a monk.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.080
Whether you wear robes and you're ordained formally or not, that doesn't

02:18.080 --> 02:22.880
matter. But the lifestyle of somebody who has renounced the world,

02:22.880 --> 02:27.600
who is sense-restraint, well, that matters, that is a necessary basis for it.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.240
While this constitutes a summoner, sense-restraint,

02:30.240 --> 02:35.840
celibacy, seclusion, devoted to seclusion, as much as possible,

02:35.840 --> 02:40.480
and not being engaged, preoccupied, concerned,

02:40.480 --> 02:46.800
inspired by worldly affairs. So you might need to do some worldly

02:46.800 --> 02:51.120
things to some extent, even as monks you have to.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.800
But that's one thing, doing it as like a chore

02:54.800 --> 02:58.320
and doing it because you're still driven by it and you still want it and you

02:58.320 --> 03:03.440
still desire towards it. So that must be abandoned.

03:03.440 --> 03:09.600
So technically you can live a lay life, but

03:09.680 --> 03:15.040
if you were able to live lay life, yet be so withdrawn from everything,

03:15.040 --> 03:19.040
succeeding that, why don't you just become a monk? Nothing would stop you from

03:19.040 --> 03:22.320
becoming a monk. So usually when somebody

03:22.320 --> 03:25.040
doesn't become a monk, it's because something is still stopping them in the

03:25.040 --> 03:28.880
world, which is a form of concern, and that in itself

03:28.880 --> 03:32.480
is an impediment for if they want to be an arhat.

03:32.480 --> 03:37.760
So one can go forth without ordaining?

03:39.040 --> 03:42.880
Yes, but not because you feel like you've gone forth,

03:42.880 --> 03:46.080
but because you actually became sort upon or higher.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.760
And that's why the noble Arya Sangha in the Suttas

03:49.760 --> 03:52.480
includes lay people, they were not monks, but they were actually

03:52.480 --> 03:57.040
Aryas. And consequently one can go forth and

03:57.040 --> 04:01.200
ordain and still be a householder in his mind.

04:01.200 --> 04:05.600
So wearing robes is not a guarantee that you will,

04:05.600 --> 04:13.120
that you are a Samana, that you have that distinction of a noble Sangha.
