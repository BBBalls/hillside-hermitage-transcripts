00:00.000 --> 00:16.560
These questions seem to revolve around a suitor that maybe I should read out and it's the

00:16.560 --> 00:33.560
a big pecuni, some uter from the name of Padira and talk about the chariot. So go for it, I don't know where he is now.

00:33.560 --> 00:45.560
Mara, the evil one, says, by whom is this creature formed? Who is the creature's maker? Who is the risen creature?

00:45.560 --> 00:57.560
Who is the creature that ceases? And Padira the nun says, why do you refer to the creature? Mara, are you involved in wrong view?

00:57.560 --> 01:09.560
This is a pile of pure determinations. There is here no creature to be found, just as for an assemblage of parts there is the term chariot.

01:09.560 --> 01:19.560
So when there are the aggregates, convention says the creature. It is merely suffering that comes into being, suffering that stands and disappears.

01:19.560 --> 01:27.560
Nothing apart from suffering comes into being, nothing other than suffering ceases.

01:27.560 --> 01:35.560
That's it? Yeah, that's quite good. See, there's the whole point there, the designation of a chariot.

01:35.560 --> 01:51.560
As she says, can I have that please? She never, she does not deny the name, the term, given to the assemblage of parts.

01:51.560 --> 01:58.560
There is a assemblage of parts, there is a name chariot. It's a functional assemblage of parts, it's called chariot.

01:58.560 --> 02:12.560
All of it is real. The assemblage of parts, yeah, you can break the chariot into parts, or rather you can descend the parts within the chariot, in the same sense you can descend more particular things within the general things.

02:12.560 --> 02:27.560
Ultimately the most general being the five aggregates, the nature of form, feeling, deception, determinations, consciousness. Within that general phenomenon of those aggregates, you can have more particular manifestations of it.

02:27.560 --> 02:33.560
And the experience as a whole evolve, you can call a person, you can call whatever.

02:33.560 --> 02:48.560
But there's a difference between if you're just designating it, or if that designation stands for your self view, for your wrong view of really assuming the priority of that designation over those parts.

02:48.560 --> 03:00.560
So the problem is that the questions of the king, King Melinda, I think it evolved around similar, but it's somewhat subtle, but not that subtle.

03:00.560 --> 03:12.560
But again, if people don't really carefully, they won't see it. Well, by, he dismisses, he says that by destroying parts, you destroy the name that you've given to the parts.

03:12.560 --> 03:21.560
Not even that, not even you destroy, but more like you deny the reality of it. Because he said, well, see there is a chariot.

03:21.560 --> 03:29.560
But if you take a chariot and break it up, break these parts up, then there is no chariot anymore.

03:29.560 --> 03:35.560
No, there is. There's still parts of chariot. It's just, it's not functional anymore, so you can call it somewhere else, something else.

03:35.560 --> 03:48.560
So you don't, like, he might have replaced the particular designation of a chariot, but he doesn't see that he did not undo the nature of designation standing for your wrong view.

03:48.560 --> 03:55.560
In other words, he might have fixed, not even fixed, he might have replaced or affected a particular designation, but not affected the nature of designation.

03:55.560 --> 04:03.560
Why? Because you can destroy the chariot into parts, or even destroy the parts, into completely non-functional parts.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.560
Still, there is a designation in regard to that, you would call it the pile of rubbish.

04:08.560 --> 04:16.560
And it's equally real, as the chariot was a designation for functional assemblage of those parts, not just when they were thrown around on a pile.

04:16.560 --> 04:25.560
So you can't, like, even conceive not having a designation, like name and matter, number, or just, oh, that's your experience.

04:25.560 --> 04:41.560
Not just, oh, undo Nama, and have the pure full group of whatever else. They don't even think in those terms, but they do imply that affecting designation, destroying it, denying its reality, or whatever else, somehow frees you from the view attached to it.

04:41.560 --> 04:48.560
But it doesn't, because you can't actually even conceive the absence of designation, because an absence of designation is another designation.

04:48.560 --> 04:55.560
Oh, there is no designation here. You just designated it with that.

04:55.560 --> 05:06.560
So, sister Vajira here, she does not, be cognizant yet. Yeah.

05:06.560 --> 05:13.560
She does not, yeah, Vajira, the nun. She does not deny. She doesn't say this chariot is not real.

05:13.560 --> 05:21.560
She says, this chariot, this designation exists on account of the five aggregates existing.

05:21.560 --> 05:27.560
But she has fully understood that the five aggregates have a reason on their own.

05:27.560 --> 05:33.560
You cannot even conceive being a master of them, or owning them, they manifest for that reason, they will cease.

05:33.560 --> 05:41.560
Thus, any designation that arises in regard to that shares the same nature, cannot even be owned, appropriated access, nothing.

05:41.560 --> 05:47.560
It just designates this while this is. But this is not anymore, that designation is it.

05:47.560 --> 05:54.560
But there is no question of whether it's real or not, and what's behind it, and what comes first, not anything like that.

05:54.560 --> 06:02.560
So, she has no need to destroy the five aggregates to prove to herself that designation is mere hollow, designation of whatever else.

06:02.560 --> 06:08.560
No, she knows that the five aggregates have a, you can't even destroy the five aggregates. That's incomprehensible.

06:08.560 --> 06:17.560
You can't change the order of the parts, as in a bit of points out in his critique of the questions of King Melinda.

06:17.560 --> 06:26.560
Because you can undo chariot, but you can't do your own experience and like throw it on a pile and prove yourself that your designation because of that are not real.

06:26.560 --> 06:37.560
It's a bit like a fantasy that doesn't even stand like it remotely for the way things actually are, because you can't even conceive the step outside of your experience and change it

06:37.560 --> 06:47.560
to see that it can be changed. But that happens when people want to observe, they want to perceive the change as a proof of impermanence or whatever else.

06:47.560 --> 06:58.560
But as I said before, that's not what impermanence is. Impermanence is in the fact that a thing, an aggregate, a phenomenon of any kind, has a reason on its own.

06:58.560 --> 07:07.560
You have no say in its manifestation. For that very reason, it's impermanent, because it has a reason, that's why it has to cease.

07:07.560 --> 07:16.560
No other reason. Just because you've manifested and you have no access to the point of origin of that benefit.

07:16.560 --> 07:25.560
You can't even conceive how things are, they just manifest basically. All you can discern is arising. For that reason, that thing will have to cease.

07:25.560 --> 07:37.560
But can't you discern arising, but you can also know that it is dependent, that it is a reason, because of some, well, dependent on something else.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
Such a?

07:38.560 --> 07:41.560
It can't arise. You can't just have designation and a river.

07:41.560 --> 07:51.560
Oh yeah, no, no. I'm just talking about the experience as a whole. I'm not talking about designation itself here, when I was referring to anything that arises.

07:51.560 --> 07:59.560
Because anything that arises can be taken as a thing itself. Thus the sort of analysis that whatever has the nature of arising, has the nature of ceasing.

07:59.560 --> 08:04.560
Be it a designation, be it a perception, be it a days, be it that, shares the nature of arising.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.560
Because it partakes in that nature. For that reason, because it manifests, that's why it's impermanent.

08:09.560 --> 08:14.560
Not because you see it's ending, you see it's cessation. You see it's disappearance of destruction. No.

08:14.560 --> 08:23.560
You know that it's there, because it has a reason. If it has a reason, it could have not ceased in the future. It could have not be liable to a possibility to cease in the future.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.560
Why? Because it's never manifested. Because it was manifested, that's why it's going to go.

08:28.560 --> 08:33.560
Even if you never see it go, you know, it's manifested, thus it's impermanent.

08:33.560 --> 08:42.560
Because when I say it's manifested, thus it's impermanent, because it is dependent on something.

08:42.560 --> 08:51.560
What? Well, like the particles, I feel, feeling can't just be by itself.

08:51.560 --> 08:58.560
No, they will come fine, but still what's the dependence? I don't see the connection there. Unless, go?

08:58.560 --> 09:02.560
Yes, I mean, that is dependent on the other four.

09:02.560 --> 09:07.560
Yeah, well, but the other fours are equally dependent on each other.

09:07.560 --> 09:16.560
So, which means that you basically, from an arisen thing, as arisen, you went into comparison with other arisen things.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.560
And I have treated them as a group, failing to see that that entire group is just one arisen thing.

09:20.560 --> 09:25.560
Also, on a more general level, and that is impermanent.

09:25.560 --> 09:30.560
For no other reason, then the reason of, because it has arisen.

09:30.560 --> 09:37.560
Okay, you can get five aggregates, you can say they are well, they depend on each other well, and what, or five of them depend on them.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.560
Or nothing.

09:39.560 --> 09:46.560
Because any dependence you look of that kind is a linear dependence that you can perceive.

09:46.560 --> 09:51.560
They don't need to depend on anything.

09:51.560 --> 09:58.560
Just the fact that they have manifested, and their sense of self comes secondary to that, and always will be.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.560
You can't access. You can't be the reason for the manifestation.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.560
You can't arm here, and then create them out there.

10:05.560 --> 10:11.560
Why? Because even the thought of arm here is already preceded by the appearance of the five aggregates.

10:11.560 --> 10:17.560
So, they are always ahead of you, or below you, or around you, and closed within them.

10:17.560 --> 10:22.560
They will be the most accurate to put it.

10:22.560 --> 10:29.560
So, sure, yeah, there is no feeling without perception and intention. There is an intention without feeling and perception.

10:29.560 --> 10:40.560
So, depending on what approach you take, the point is, well, all of them, as the experience is at all, as general as you can push it,

10:40.560 --> 10:43.560
share the same nature of being manifested.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.560
And that's the sole reason for their impermanence.

10:47.560 --> 10:55.560
So, you can't explain that using linear explanation, because if you could, means that our view could be explained,

10:55.560 --> 11:02.560
could be deduced by observing things, but you can't.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.560
That's why it's so subtle to get it. It's still a view.

11:05.560 --> 11:13.560
But it comes only personally as a direct insight, based on obvious external instructions, knowing what to look for.

11:13.560 --> 11:26.560
And that's why it's always summed up in that general, very general description of whatever has a nature arising, has a nature of ceasing,

11:26.560 --> 11:30.560
which is basically the other way, putting it in permanent.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.560
Whatever has a nature arising, it's in permanent.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.560
And that's the whole point.

11:36.560 --> 11:44.560
Your five aggregates don't cease, but as long as you look. So, if you need them to actually observe their cessation in order to understand impermanence,

11:44.560 --> 11:48.560
that's a constriction in terms, means, because you'll be dead when they cease.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.560
So, how can you observe impermanence then? You can't.

11:51.560 --> 12:01.560
So, impermanence is not in the scientific observation of things disintegrating in impermanence,

12:01.560 --> 12:21.560
is in the fact that you have no control, no input, in that very subtle, very general notion of things arising, manifesting.

12:21.560 --> 12:28.560
And the experience of destruction of things, it's another arising.

12:28.560 --> 12:35.560
So, arising is manifesting, ceasing is manifesting, changing whilst checking, the sanding is also manifesting.

12:35.560 --> 12:48.560
And because things are manifesting, they're impermanent, not because they have a duration or a shelf life.

12:48.560 --> 12:59.560
There's always some, maybe I can't remember far back in I thought, it's things are always changing, it's always things.

12:59.560 --> 13:08.560
Just taking on different forms, never ending, just taking on another form, evolving, becoming.

13:08.560 --> 13:14.560
It's an iron, I can't remember our previous life or previous forms.

13:14.560 --> 13:19.560
But it's a duration or something. But then you fail to see, right there and then,

13:19.560 --> 13:23.560
that you have a thought that connects all of those forms.

13:23.560 --> 13:30.560
And you're not seeing that thought as impermanent, which is where your self is, which is why there are wrong views,

13:30.560 --> 13:33.560
which is why people can't think that, and which is why people do think,

13:33.560 --> 13:44.560
ah, like the matter, the four great elements of fire, depending on what division you take, and although I list those wrong views in the suitors,

13:44.560 --> 13:49.560
there's nothing really destroying, nothing really changes, they're always there, they just change its shape or whatever else,

13:49.560 --> 13:53.560
but it's always the same things always has been, always will be.

13:53.560 --> 13:58.560
So whether you chop someone's head off or whatever, it's just elements going through elements, nothing exists,

13:58.560 --> 14:07.560
not here, failing to see that that is a very gratuitous thought of you that you adopted,

14:07.560 --> 14:13.560
and you have no proof for it, because if you can't remember what was in your previous life,

14:13.560 --> 14:18.560
how can you remember that it was there if you can't remember that it wasn't?

14:18.560 --> 14:23.560
You can't, which means you decide because it's more pleasing to you for whatever reason.

14:23.560 --> 14:29.560
You decide that there was, you decide that there will be.

14:29.560 --> 14:36.560
But if you were to remove all of the bad faith, which means it takes away all the wrong views,

14:36.560 --> 14:43.560
the only thing that you can refer to as a fact, as a law, as something that is undeniable,

14:43.560 --> 14:49.560
is something that you did not create, that you did not concoct in your thoughts or assumptions,

14:49.560 --> 14:55.560
would be whatever has a reason, it's incriminate, that's it, only that.

14:55.560 --> 15:01.560
So then the old Dhamma is built just on that, or within that.

15:05.560 --> 15:09.560
And yeah, you can build a good thought.

15:09.560 --> 15:21.560
When you look back to the memories of your past, you connect that.

15:21.560 --> 15:26.560
Exactly, you made that connection right here, right now, for which you have no proof,

15:26.560 --> 15:31.560
any more than the fact that you don't have proof whether it was really always changing or not,

15:31.560 --> 15:33.560
or impermanent or not.

15:33.560 --> 15:39.560
Which means you decide, you make an assumption that it was so.

15:39.560 --> 15:47.560
Because there are, I was like, you have a photo of yourself as a child and you, as a teenager,

15:47.560 --> 15:49.560
and you make the connection.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.560
You look at the photo and say, that's who I was.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.560
But it's who I am more.

15:53.560 --> 15:59.560
Well, there is a connection in a sense that there is a connection between particular and general.

15:59.560 --> 16:05.560
It is still the enduring body that is changing while remaining the same.

16:05.560 --> 16:12.560
It's a one offshoot from your mother that is now growing old and aging and so on,

16:12.560 --> 16:19.560
while overall remaining the same body, the same produce.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.560
But that's just, that's just things existing on different levels of generality.

16:23.560 --> 16:29.560
Other changes, they are allowed to because on a more general level, a finger remains the same.

16:29.560 --> 16:34.560
So arising, ceasing, and changing while standing.

16:34.560 --> 16:39.560
So it's not all in there in front of you, which means if you approach your designation in that sense,

16:39.560 --> 16:41.560
you won't see it as a designation.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.560
It will always be in regard to that.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.560
But none of that is a problem.

16:47.560 --> 17:01.560
Yeah, none of that is a problem because things need to exist or other things existence is comprised on different levels of generality.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.560
So a more particular change means on a more general level, it's not changing.

17:05.560 --> 17:11.560
Then if you look at general level, you can see it's changing there because on a more general level, it's not changing.

17:11.560 --> 17:20.560
And what is the ultimately, not changing on the most general level, it's the nature of form, nature of feeling, nature of perception, nature of determination, nature of consciousness.

17:20.560 --> 17:28.560
That's why the five aggregates always remain that which is in common to any life you have before or none of life you're going to have ahead.

17:28.560 --> 17:33.560
So you can think, ah, so the five aggregates are myself then because that remains I'm changing.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.560
No, that changes too.

17:35.560 --> 17:41.560
But nature in regard to that remains the same because there is a change in a more particular level.

17:41.560 --> 18:08.560
So, Antonio or Craig when he was born and he's lay life, the whole time spent in aging and growing and changing on that particular level, yeah, that's all real.

18:08.560 --> 18:13.560
Equally, as it's real to refer to that whole person as Craig, Antonio, when he was young or whatever.

18:13.560 --> 18:17.560
People say that's not a real thing.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.560
Well, exactly.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.560
So that's why she says, why is that a problem?

18:22.560 --> 18:28.560
Vajira, the nuns, it's just the aggregates and the term, the designate in them.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.560
That's not a problem.

18:30.560 --> 18:39.560
The problem is, and always has been, suffering being arising, suffering ceasing, suffering arising in regard to this suffering in regard.

18:39.560 --> 18:43.560
So the whole structure of general particular, it's completely relevant.

18:43.560 --> 18:52.560
I mean, it's relevant in a sense that it's confused as a source of problem, but it's not actually the source of problem, which is what it says.

18:52.560 --> 19:01.560
When dirty aggregates, you call it a creature. It's merely suffering that comes into being, suffering that stands and suffering that disappears.

19:01.560 --> 19:07.560
That's the issue, there has always been the issue, and you fix that, you fix all of the issues, nothing else.

19:07.560 --> 19:12.560
So, denying the reality of designation, saying, well, this is just an empty convention.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.560
As such, it is real. What's the problem?

19:15.560 --> 19:18.560
If it's empty of four, what's the problem?

19:18.560 --> 19:25.560
Saying that it's an empty convention means you just designated further the original convention, or designation.

19:25.560 --> 19:30.560
You designate the creature, and it's an empty designation of a creature.

19:30.560 --> 19:38.560
And you can go indefinitely like that, infinitely, it's just the same thing. It's still a designation.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.560
Because people can say, it was never an issue.

19:41.560 --> 19:49.560
However, I was African, now I'm British, you see, the definitions aren't real.

19:49.560 --> 19:53.560
Which is basically all revolves around denying their suffering.

19:53.560 --> 20:02.560
Because if you deny the reality of things that are apparently causing you to suffer, you feel like you did dealt with your suffering.

20:02.560 --> 20:10.560
But it's a wrong view, it's a big mistake from the start, because neither designations nor anything external was ever the reason for your suffering.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.560
Because if you were, freedom from it would not be possible, why?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.560
Because those things arise at their own.

20:15.560 --> 20:20.560
Which means suffering would always be manifested on its own, which means you have no say in it.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.560
But that's not the case.

20:23.560 --> 20:29.560
So being a subtle designation, a coarse designation, an empty designation, a full designation, be it a real thing, or unreal thing.

20:29.560 --> 20:35.560
All of those are manifested phenomena, and as such, they're external.

20:35.560 --> 20:41.560
Which means they're never the reason for suffering. It's craving in regard to them.

20:41.560 --> 20:48.560
In regard to what you feel, in regard to how we perceive things and so on, that the suffering is there.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.560
Presence of craving means presence of suffering.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.560
Absence of craving is absence of suffering.

20:54.560 --> 21:00.560
Leaving the whole domain of designations far back gets intact in that sense.

21:00.560 --> 21:09.560
But because you don't discern that, because a person's pathogen that does not see the origin of suffering as an awful truth,

21:09.560 --> 21:17.560
he assumes automatically, and that's why every pathogen that has in common, you can't do this by accident.

21:17.560 --> 21:20.560
You can't do it wrongly by accident.

21:20.560 --> 21:29.560
Every pathogen assumes that when he suffers in regard to something, it's that something that's the reason for his suffering.

21:29.560 --> 21:36.560
Then you can sort of, on the clueless level, you hate people.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.560
Or you said something, he's a bad person, because I'm suffering in that account.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.560
It's actually 100% his fault that I suffer.

21:43.560 --> 21:47.560
Then you might work through that attitude and realize, well, be that as you may,

21:47.560 --> 21:51.560
I really don't have to say about other people, so you might start refining it.

21:51.560 --> 21:56.560
But you won't be able to go further than blaming designations for suffering.

21:56.560 --> 22:02.560
Pain blaming the apparent reality of things for your suffering, which is the ultimate reaching point,

22:02.560 --> 22:07.560
which is not really ultimate of any kind, of Machiallum Buddhism or any other.

22:07.560 --> 22:14.560
Well, even the contemporary terravada Buddhism would deny, which denies the reality of things through western science,

22:14.560 --> 22:17.560
is proven, the things are constantly changing, thus nothing is real, thus see.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.560
It's all an illusion.

22:19.560 --> 22:26.560
It's a completely mistaken point, a mistaken view, a mistaken direction, that the only purpose of it is

22:26.560 --> 22:32.560
to allow you to keep denying things, so not to suffer immediately, or account of it.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.560
But it's not freedom from suffering, it's just management.

22:35.560 --> 22:41.560
Because in order to deny, well, the fact that you need to deny means you're affected first.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.560
Now you need to deal with it, and denial will be a form of dealing with it.

22:45.560 --> 22:52.560
But so do bananas, and then others, they don't have to act upon the unpleasant feeling at all.

22:52.560 --> 22:58.560
They don't need to do anything, on account of unpleasant feeling there's a reason why, because they don't suffer.

22:58.560 --> 23:03.560
They have pulled out the first arrow, so they're not hit by the second arrow,

23:03.560 --> 23:07.560
of needing to do things when you experience pain.

23:07.560 --> 23:13.560
So, psychotherapy, psychology, contemporary Buddhism, every other religion are all forms of management

23:13.560 --> 23:19.560
of the suffering, because you don't know the escape from it in the first place.

23:19.560 --> 23:24.560
Thus, your best legal selection is to manage it.

23:24.560 --> 23:29.560
Whether you manage it to explain it in a way, oh, it's my chemical imbalance, that's why I suffer.

23:29.560 --> 23:34.560
Well, it's because my parents were not supportive of me when I was young,

23:34.560 --> 23:37.560
or well, no, it's because everything is not real.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.560
All of these are mere conventions.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.560
You think you exist, but you don't.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.560
You think pain is real, but it's not.

23:44.560 --> 23:47.560
All of those revolve around the same thing.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.560
I don't know the way out of this pain.

23:50.560 --> 23:59.560
So, I'm just trying to justify it, try to explain it, blame me externally, but never really understanding it.

23:59.560 --> 24:05.560
Because if you were, then, yeah, parents didn't love me, that's a fact.

24:05.560 --> 24:09.560
But it's not a fact on account of which I have to suffer.

24:09.560 --> 24:15.560
Things are real around real, well, if I, the fact that I can say the things are unreal, that's real.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.560
That designation is real.

24:18.560 --> 24:23.560
So, their lack of reality might pertain to a more particular level, if you didn't know, that wasn't real.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.560
But on a more general level, as a designation, if you just utter,

24:26.560 --> 24:32.560
that you're able to think of, that you're able to direct and designate, it's real.

24:32.560 --> 24:37.560
So, it's a contradiction in terms of saying, oh, this is not real.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.560
Because if it's not real, it just wouldn't be manifested.

24:40.560 --> 24:46.560
You wouldn't be able to even think about it, let alone speak and point at it.

24:46.560 --> 24:55.560
So, all of that confusion comes out of the result, as a result of not knowing the way out of suffering that has arisen.

24:55.560 --> 25:04.560
Seeing something arisen, and then trying to make it not be what it is.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.560
And because you're suffering, you got to it.

25:07.560 --> 25:15.560
So, it would be as if a person is sick, terminal ill, and there is no parent cure.

25:15.560 --> 25:19.560
So, in the end, he just started denying his illness.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.560
Well, it's not real.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.560
His life is not real to begin with.

25:23.560 --> 25:29.560
So, it starts dismissing at all, because it's, it alleviates suffering to some degree.

25:29.560 --> 25:33.560
Through bad faith, through ignoring, through turning a blind eye and so on.

25:33.560 --> 25:37.560
It doesn't fix the illness at all. It doesn't affect it in any way.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.560
It just makes you know, you get it.

25:39.560 --> 25:44.560
And the attitude of not looking is nothing else than the attitude of ignoring.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.560
And ignoring is what a VJ is.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.560
It's not, I think I've said it many times before.

25:50.560 --> 25:56.560
It's not a physical veil of ignorance that is sort of being uncovered one day.

25:56.560 --> 26:02.560
If you were lucky, or if you made enough of the right mystical effort for whatever else.

26:02.560 --> 26:09.560
Ignorance is act of bad faith, act of ignoring, act of not acknowledging, act of assuming.

26:09.560 --> 26:13.560
All of those acts maintain the act of ignorance.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.560
So, you're fully responsible for the religion.

26:15.560 --> 26:19.560
You're maintaining it in your daily actions.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.560
Obviously, not on a particular level.

26:22.560 --> 26:25.560
Or rather, you won't find it, you won't discern it on a particular level.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.560
It's there, but you won't discern it.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.560
But you have to discern it on a more general level, which is where it arises.

26:31.560 --> 26:38.560
And general level being in regard to the nature of things.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.560
Because you can say this is not real.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.560
The nature of that statement, the nature of that experience is real.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.560
It's manifested as such.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.560
So, that's why all these things need to be allowed to arise.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.560
Why? Because that's where the problem is, in their arising.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.560
That's why they're impermanent.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.560
The problem is you not seeing that impermanent.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.560
Thus, you end up putting everything else on the top.

27:01.560 --> 27:05.560
All you have to do is to start discerning impermanence within the heart of things.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.560
Because they have a reason, not because they're ceasing.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.560
And the whole thing will sort of...

27:12.560 --> 27:18.560
Like in the cartoon, when you see a knitted jumper and a cap just pulls one string

27:18.560 --> 27:22.560
and the whole thing just gets undone eventually.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.560
Well, that's exactly the point.

27:24.560 --> 27:30.560
If you get the right one and you stick to the right one, stick to the right view.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.560
It will unravel everything else.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.560
Trying to stop something from going up?

27:36.560 --> 27:39.560
That's good.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.560
Okay, well.

27:46.560 --> 28:12.560
Yeah, but in terms of the nature of things, they're overrides.

28:12.560 --> 28:21.560
But if you just leave it as that, you can say it is impermanent.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.560
But you have to know it.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.560
You can't just naturally...

28:26.560 --> 28:34.560
The dammit as the universal law, as the universal path that has always been there can be walked is there.

28:34.560 --> 28:38.560
But that's not to say that you're already walking it.

28:38.560 --> 28:44.560
So the impermanence is generally in those things. Because if it weren't, you wouldn't be able to find it there.

28:44.560 --> 28:48.560
But that's the thing. You need to discern it. You need to find it.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.560
Because it's there, that discernment is possible.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.560
And you'll find that out when you discern it.

28:53.560 --> 28:58.560
So until you discern it, you have to have faith that it's discernible.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.560
And that you're doing ignorance?

29:00.560 --> 29:07.560
Well, exactly. Because if you're just being with things, you're just being with it, but you're not doing anything.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.560
So that's why you can't...

29:09.560 --> 29:14.560
Like that's why you need all of these, like, you know, so many sutras and...

29:14.560 --> 29:19.560
And countless numbers of instructions and descriptions and incarnations and pointers and so on,

29:19.560 --> 29:22.560
that the Buddha was going around teaching.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.560
Well, because if you just stay with things, well, you're just staying with your ignorance.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.560
You need to know what to look for.

29:28.560 --> 29:34.560
Yeah. You can't keep throwing more rubbish onto the thing you're trying to discern.

29:34.560 --> 29:39.560
So there is that. There is just staying with the thing that has a reason, not piling up more.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.560
But then that's just...

29:41.560 --> 29:44.560
Okay, now that you've got it, now you need to start doing the work.

29:44.560 --> 29:51.560
Now that you learn how not to keep throwing more rubbish on your experience in terms of the wrong views and so on,

29:51.560 --> 29:54.560
you learn that. You get established in that.

29:54.560 --> 30:00.560
That's a starting point now, so you can begin a proper work.

30:00.560 --> 30:07.560
Or like you're taking further.

30:07.560 --> 30:15.560
But usually people, you will hear, you know, Buddhist monks, archons, whoever,

30:15.560 --> 30:17.560
that's what everything will come in it.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.560
And every religion teaches that in one form or the other.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.560
Just sort of either through denying the world or whatever,

30:23.560 --> 30:27.560
but you arrive at the point of just being with things and that's it.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.560
Just let it flow.

30:28.560 --> 30:33.560
Just let it flow. Just be here now, present, aware in the present moment.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.560
Don't judge. Don't do this. Don't do that. Just be. Just be.

30:36.560 --> 30:40.560
Just be, feeling to see that, yeah, good.

30:40.560 --> 30:47.560
Now that you're just being, you have to start discerning that very just being a problem.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.560
That's where the problem is.

30:49.560 --> 30:53.560
Everything else that you thought the problem was was just extra.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.560
On top of your problem, there was preventing you to see it.

30:56.560 --> 31:00.560
Now that you learn how to just be mindful and simplify your life,

31:00.560 --> 31:04.560
that's like before you begin the practice.

31:04.560 --> 31:08.560
So it's a prerequisite.

31:08.560 --> 31:12.560
It's not to be confused as a final goal.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.560
I mean, it's so far from it that it's just like, it's still wrong.

31:15.560 --> 31:20.560
You're still protruding and you can still be just present with things with your protruding mind,

31:20.560 --> 31:22.560
with your protruding ignorance.

31:22.560 --> 31:28.560
And you can spend your whole life because ignorance, one, can't get undone by itself.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
Because it's not there by itself, you're doing it.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.560
So you have to learn how to stop doing it and that's how it's done.

31:33.560 --> 31:37.560
So if you don't learn how to stop doing it, you just be, you're just being with it.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.560
Yeah, that's the point.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.560
That's you, you're doing it.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.560
It's not doing itself. It's not faster upon you.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.560
Ignorance is not given to you.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.560
Yeah.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.560
By maintaining it.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.560
Exactly.

31:50.560 --> 31:55.560
In the same sense, again, ignorance or whatever, any other awesome states you want to pick up

31:55.560 --> 31:59.560
from the sutras, it's over where that craving is.

31:59.560 --> 32:05.560
Or rather, it all shares the nature of that very craving, which is something you're doing in regard to things.

32:05.560 --> 32:12.560
So in the same sense that you can say craving is the reason for your suffering, the direct reason for suffering.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.560
Not that on account of which you crave, which results in suffering.

32:16.560 --> 32:21.560
So nothing external is the direct reason for suffering except your craving in regard to it.

32:21.560 --> 32:25.560
In the same sense, you can say ignorance is the reason for suffering.

32:25.560 --> 32:30.560
Nothing external, but your attitude in regard to the external, the attitude of ignoring,

32:30.560 --> 32:36.560
the attitude of turning up like the attitude of bad faith.

32:36.560 --> 32:40.560
That's the reason for suffering.

32:40.560 --> 32:47.560
It was a very distinct, this couple in Norway.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.560
I think it's in Norway.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.560
The government said that they need to register a baby.

32:54.560 --> 32:58.560
They need to register a baby's name and refuse to do so.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.560
So they were fined.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.560
So they were forced to go and register the name for the baby.

33:04.560 --> 33:11.560
So they called it B-X-J-A-I-Z-Z-I-2-T. Like it's 21-Lets.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.560
There's a nurse ridiculous.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.560
You need to register a problem.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.560
It's too long as two.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.560
So put A, another find the game.

33:20.560 --> 33:23.560
You can't just call it A, you have to give it.

33:23.560 --> 33:31.560
So there's an example that they were trying to get away from this whole institution, this whole society,

33:31.560 --> 33:34.560
because that's the problem.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.560
That was the cause of the assault.

33:37.560 --> 33:40.560
I think that's why they suffer.

33:40.560 --> 33:44.560
So they're not going to let their child go to the same society.

33:44.560 --> 33:49.560
Fending to see that, showing the society is another attitude towards the society,

33:49.560 --> 33:54.560
which in this particular case resulted in even more hassle for which they felt fully justified

33:54.560 --> 33:58.560
in their anger and in a well because they, I'm sure, they thought they were right.

33:58.560 --> 34:03.560
They're just equally deluded as the society that is put into name now.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.560
Because there was never a problem.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.560
Never a problem was no issue.

34:09.560 --> 34:13.560
But yeah, it's a very common view.

34:13.560 --> 34:22.560
As I said, in other schools of Buddhism, or other schools of Buddhism today, or other religions,

34:22.560 --> 34:28.560
that's the most you can get, deny the reality by one mean or the other.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.560
Why?

34:29.560 --> 34:34.560
Because you mistakenly blend it from the start for the reason that you're suffering,

34:34.560 --> 34:39.560
and denying of it removes the apparent reason of your suffering.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.560
But it doesn't.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.560
You're still, you're still able to suffer.

34:42.560 --> 34:46.560
So you're just a management that it's a response.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.560
And there isn't suffering.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.560
It's not uprooting it.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.560
It's not dealing with it.

34:50.560 --> 34:54.560
It's not preventing it to arise in the future.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.560
You, like you can spend your whole life managing your suffering.

34:57.560 --> 35:03.560
At the end of it, you still remain prey to suffering as much as you were in the beginning.

35:03.560 --> 35:09.560
You have not affected a grain of that nature of being prey to suffering,

35:09.560 --> 35:13.560
being liable to suffer.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.560
Because all you've been doing is managing the actual suffering,

35:16.560 --> 35:19.560
or the prospect of actual suffering.

35:19.560 --> 35:26.560
So it was like, you can also go and just ignore as hard as you can.

35:26.560 --> 35:27.560
Yeah.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.560
Oh.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.560
You know, the mystical illusion.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.560
Yeah.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.560
Really enjoy the suffering.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.560
Really get into it.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.560
Yeah.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.560
So it's not a problem anymore because you really want it.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.560
Yeah.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.560
You force yourself to want it.

35:38.560 --> 35:43.560
All of that is a secondary attitude or other response.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.560
Because you can't handle it.

35:44.560 --> 35:48.560
In regard to the fact that it has a reason and you were affected by it.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.560
So whether you're accepted or rejected.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.560
Both accepted and rejected.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.560
Neither accepted nor rejected.

35:53.560 --> 35:56.560
Because there's nothing to accept nor reject.

35:56.560 --> 36:04.560
All of those will be a form of response,

36:04.560 --> 36:09.560
a reaction to the fact that it has a reason and it's struck you.

36:09.560 --> 36:14.560
And the fact that you have no option but to respond.

36:14.560 --> 36:21.560
But to react means you're striking yourself second time on account of it.

36:35.560 --> 36:43.560
So if one has the understanding of such a plan.

36:43.560 --> 36:44.560
Of such a plan.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.560
The things are not mine.

36:46.560 --> 36:49.560
Well, has that understanding of another?

36:49.560 --> 36:50.560
Not self.

36:50.560 --> 37:00.560
Then what stops him from not doing whatever he wants?

37:00.560 --> 37:01.560
Whatever.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.560
Is there a sort of mine?

37:04.560 --> 37:05.560
Well.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.560
So he'd abandoned his responsibility towards things.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.560
He already comes it.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.560
Yeah.

37:10.560 --> 37:13.560
Well, it's an experience of liberation.

37:13.560 --> 37:18.560
But the burden is laid out.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.560
It's whether we compare it to the burden.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.560
It is.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.560
Yeah.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.560
You overcut it.

37:23.560 --> 37:24.560
Imagine.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.560
As the sutras talk in the hands of Janas and similar.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.560
You were imprisoned.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.560
Your family left out there.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.560
And you were it because you feel responsible.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.560
Well, you're not just like your family.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.560
You're fully thrown through, taking them as yours.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.560
But you're knowing control over it.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.560
So you're imprisoned and you worry.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.560
What are they going through?

37:45.560 --> 37:47.560
Are the bad things going to happen?

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
Are they going to lose them?

37:48.560 --> 37:49.560
Are they going to kill or rape?

37:49.560 --> 37:50.560
Who knows what?

37:50.560 --> 37:53.560
And then you go out and you find them intact.

37:53.560 --> 37:57.560
And then the relief from that burden of their responsibility

37:57.560 --> 37:59.560
that you had no input in.

37:59.560 --> 38:00.560
You feel.

38:00.560 --> 38:03.560
Or crossing that there's all of those other similes.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.560
So it is.

38:05.560 --> 38:10.560
Generally feeling like laying out a heavy burden.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.560
And it's a good question.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.560
What stops him from doing it?

38:14.560 --> 38:16.560
Nothing stops him.

38:16.560 --> 38:23.560
What stops him is the requirement of seal of being established

38:23.560 --> 38:28.560
first before the Dharma takes place.

38:28.560 --> 38:31.560
Because there was established when the Dharma took place

38:31.560 --> 38:34.560
and the self-view has been abolished and so on.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.560
He can't revert back to those things

38:37.560 --> 38:39.560
that were requiring that self-view

38:39.560 --> 38:41.560
which was the unwholesome behaviors.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.560
So he sets it up.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.560
But then exactly.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.560
He lets go of that as well.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.560
Which is letting go of seal of the Parmasa.

38:49.560 --> 38:53.560
Letting go of virtue and duty.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.560
And that's an extreme relief.

38:56.560 --> 39:00.560
When you lay down your duty.

39:00.560 --> 39:03.560
You don't have to do anything.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.560
Expand yours to have just sleeping.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.560
Some people say to you.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.560
But what about your mother?

39:09.560 --> 39:10.560
She's suffering.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.560
And you should go in the past.

39:12.560 --> 39:15.560
Because they're still speaking out of their self-view.

39:15.560 --> 39:18.560
Out of their sense of duty, they're still burdened by.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.560
But it's making me suffer.

39:20.560 --> 39:21.560
They are sufferers.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.560
Exactly.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.560
They do it because it's their person.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.560
But obviously somebody can misinterpret this

39:26.560 --> 39:27.560
and say, OK.

39:27.560 --> 39:30.560
So you just start denying everything and say,

39:30.560 --> 39:33.560
this is real, this is real.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.560
This must be lacking to whatever one with what people do.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.560
But no.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.560
That's why the order is not negotiable.

39:39.560 --> 39:40.560
The order of things.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.560
Seala comes first.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.560
Then the Dharma can take place.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.560
Without a sealer, whatever took place,

39:47.560 --> 39:50.560
you can be sure that it's not the Dharma.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.560
So.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.560
And they always say that.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.560
The Buddha, when he talks in the sutras,

39:55.560 --> 39:58.560
when you would say, then in the center,

39:58.560 --> 40:00.560
that the knowledge has been developed

40:00.560 --> 40:06.560
because his behavior has been purified beforehand.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.560
So whatever he understood, he understood because, OK.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.560
He really made the effort to understand

40:11.560 --> 40:14.560
and his behavior has been purified beforehand.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.560
He has a sense of shame.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
Exactly.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
Yeah.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.560
And then.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.560
So.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.560
The center of shame and fear of wrongdoing and the whole sealer,

40:22.560 --> 40:25.560
it's not the Dharma.

40:25.560 --> 40:29.560
But it's a necessary ground for the Dharma to take place.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.560
And when the Dharma does take place,

40:31.560 --> 40:33.560
you abandon that ground as well.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.560
That's why, you know, practicing them,

40:35.560 --> 40:36.560
you go beyond good ambiance.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.560
But I mean that that ground gets undone.

40:38.560 --> 40:39.560
No.

40:39.560 --> 40:40.560
No.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.560
It stays.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.560
Because they always will be a ground.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.560
You prepare it and now you take off.

40:45.560 --> 40:49.560
And that ground is left.

40:49.560 --> 40:52.560
Obviously, there are different, you know,

40:52.560 --> 40:54.560
different people, different grounds,

40:54.560 --> 40:56.560
different levels of preparing the ground,

40:56.560 --> 40:58.560
different habits, different sound.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.560
So there are many different areas in the suitors,

41:01.560 --> 41:05.560
getting up to all sorts of relatively serious mischief.

41:05.560 --> 41:09.560
And which is why they're sort of the good or the least things

41:09.560 --> 41:11.560
that sort of one I cannot do.

41:11.560 --> 41:15.560
And there's no mention that he's not able to break any of the precepts.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.560
What sort of one I cannot do?

41:17.560 --> 41:19.560
Well, the person who has prepared the ground

41:19.560 --> 41:22.560
and then left the ground laid on the burden

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
does not care anymore.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.560
He can't kill the Buddha.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.560
Kill another hand.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.560
Well, he could have killed his mother.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.560
Kill his father.

41:31.560 --> 41:35.560
He can't take any determination as permanent.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.560
Any determination is not suffering.

41:37.560 --> 41:40.560
He can't take any reason, Dhamma, as his self.

41:40.560 --> 41:44.560
He can't take anybody else other than the Buddha,

41:44.560 --> 41:45.560
as his teaching.

41:45.560 --> 41:48.560
And that means he can't take any other teaching,

41:48.560 --> 41:50.560
completely different to the understanding of the Dhamma,

41:50.560 --> 41:51.560
as a teaching.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.560
So his criteria of the Dhamma is so established

41:54.560 --> 41:56.560
that if he comes across any other teaching,

41:56.560 --> 41:59.560
it will only be, ah, this occurs to the Dhamma or this doesn't.

41:59.560 --> 42:02.560
But he can't stop and then start something completely different.

42:02.560 --> 42:06.560
Those are the things that he can't do.

42:06.560 --> 42:09.560
He can break, he can lie, he can cheat, he can steal,

42:09.560 --> 42:12.560
he can break all the precepts.

42:12.560 --> 42:16.560
I suppose even if he's pushed in some extreme circumstances,

42:16.560 --> 42:18.560
he might be able to kill as well.

42:18.560 --> 42:22.560
Not just, not that he wouldn't, um,

42:22.560 --> 42:25.560
reap the vipakas or subtractions.

42:25.560 --> 42:29.560
But, um, it wouldn't be, as the Buddha said,

42:29.560 --> 42:31.560
it wouldn't be as bad as the other,

42:31.560 --> 42:34.560
the other forms, like, as you know, when you have a,

42:34.560 --> 42:37.560
you have a little cup of water and you drop one drop of dye,

42:37.560 --> 42:40.560
everything is dye, black, you just put black.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.560
But then if you have 100 liters of water,

42:42.560 --> 42:44.560
one drop of dye will make a difference.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.560
It's still a drop of dye, a stain, impurity,

42:47.560 --> 42:50.560
but because things have changed,

42:50.560 --> 42:53.560
that's why he can't be lower than a human.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.560
He doesn't say what kind of human?

42:55.560 --> 42:58.560
Like, if he has been a very misbearing sort of guy,

42:58.560 --> 43:00.560
most likely it's going to, it's still be a human,

43:00.560 --> 43:03.560
but probably in a very, very bad, bad state,

43:03.560 --> 43:05.560
bad position, bad so on.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.560
But the thing is again, somebody will drive you

43:07.560 --> 43:10.560
to go to such an extent of killing,

43:10.560 --> 43:12.560
it's a big stretch, not impossible,

43:12.560 --> 43:14.560
because the Buddha didn't list it as impossible,

43:14.560 --> 43:16.560
but quite unlikely.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.560
But all of the other things are sort of smaller nature.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.560
That's still very much.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.560
So there's a fear, if you say that there's not mind,

43:24.560 --> 43:27.560
or you have that realise that you become a subsequent,

43:27.560 --> 43:33.560
but then you have a responsibility to another person,

43:33.560 --> 43:38.560
say a child, whatever person,

43:38.560 --> 43:43.560
and you fear that if you lose that sense of responsibility,

43:43.560 --> 43:46.560
that this child will suffer,

43:46.560 --> 43:50.560
and account for that, because you won't feed it anymore.

43:50.560 --> 43:54.560
So there's a fear of losing all sense of shame.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.560
Oh, please.

43:55.560 --> 44:00.560
Well, that's exactly why these things are a burden,

44:00.560 --> 44:02.560
are a yoke.

44:08.560 --> 44:11.560
That's why family, friends,

44:11.560 --> 44:13.560
duties and responsibilities,

44:13.560 --> 44:16.560
they're like ties, they tie you.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.560
They obstruct you for that reason,

44:18.560 --> 44:19.560
because it's not easy.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.560
Why? Because, yeah,

44:21.560 --> 44:23.560
you need to realise your own child,

44:23.560 --> 44:24.560
your own children,

44:24.560 --> 44:26.560
their wealth, anything.

44:26.560 --> 44:28.560
You need to leave the whole thing,

44:28.560 --> 44:30.560
yet your success is not guaranteed by doing that,

44:30.560 --> 44:32.560
because that's only a preparation,

44:32.560 --> 44:36.560
that's only setting up the ground.

44:36.560 --> 44:38.560
There's no guarantee you'll succeed,

44:38.560 --> 44:41.560
yet, if you were to succeed,

44:41.560 --> 44:43.560
you do have to leave it completely,

44:43.560 --> 44:48.560
utterly, 100% beforehand.

44:57.560 --> 44:58.560
You're right.

44:58.560 --> 44:59.560
That's why they wouldn't, you know,

44:59.560 --> 45:00.560
they're not going,

45:00.560 --> 45:02.560
not, not, not, not,

45:02.560 --> 45:05.560
they refuse in the beginning to teach the householders,

45:05.560 --> 45:07.560
because they would understand that,

45:07.560 --> 45:09.560
and they would take it on,

45:09.560 --> 45:11.560
as, you know, obviously,

45:11.560 --> 45:12.560
a worth thing to do,

45:12.560 --> 45:13.560
and they would leave the families,

45:13.560 --> 45:15.560
they would then go through ruin and die,

45:15.560 --> 45:17.560
and, you know, no man in the house,

45:17.560 --> 45:19.560
and that's it, they're done.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.560
So it would affect lives of many people,

45:21.560 --> 45:22.560
so they said,

45:22.560 --> 45:23.560
okay, well, don't teach it.

45:23.560 --> 45:24.560
Like, if they find out,

45:24.560 --> 45:25.560
and they don't find,

45:25.560 --> 45:28.560
but don't be directly responsible for that,

45:28.560 --> 45:30.560
just because it will affect other aspects of the order,

45:30.560 --> 45:31.560
and people are hating,

45:31.560 --> 45:32.560
or whatever,

45:32.560 --> 45:33.560
and so on.

45:33.560 --> 45:34.560
So in the long run,

45:34.560 --> 45:37.560
you'll see it's better.

45:37.560 --> 45:38.560
But still, like that,

45:38.560 --> 45:40.560
it's just like, you know,

45:40.560 --> 45:41.560
to be coming out on something,

45:41.560 --> 45:42.560
but there are many sort of punishments

45:42.560 --> 45:43.560
back in the Buddha's day,

45:43.560 --> 45:46.560
they would just lay householders.

45:46.560 --> 45:49.560
And when they were in the Buddha's father,

45:49.560 --> 45:50.560
came to him,

45:50.560 --> 45:51.560
and his tears upset,

45:51.560 --> 45:52.560
they stroked,

45:52.560 --> 45:54.560
because the Buddha took his grandson,

45:54.560 --> 45:55.560
the Buddha's son,

45:55.560 --> 45:57.560
Rahola.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.560
So imagine his state of mind,

45:59.560 --> 46:01.560
and then the Buddha coming down,

46:01.560 --> 46:02.560
and then getting the teaching,

46:02.560 --> 46:03.560
and then he understood,

46:03.560 --> 46:04.560
and he became a sotapana,

46:04.560 --> 46:06.560
right there and then.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.560
And then he said,

46:07.560 --> 46:08.560
okay, well, thank you.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.560
I do have to go,

46:09.560 --> 46:10.560
because, you know,

46:10.560 --> 46:11.560
we always are very busy,

46:11.560 --> 46:12.560
and so,

46:12.560 --> 46:13.560
I have things to do.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.560
Sotapana said that,

46:14.560 --> 46:16.560
I've only become a sotapana.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.560
So it's not that big a deal,

46:18.560 --> 46:19.560
but in a sense,

46:19.560 --> 46:20.560
it is.

46:20.560 --> 46:21.560
But in another sense,

46:21.560 --> 46:23.560
it isn't.

46:23.560 --> 46:29.560
Because there's still a lot to be done.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.560
How can we see the downman

46:31.560 --> 46:34.560
by contemplating designation?

46:34.560 --> 46:37.560
What is another word for designation?

46:37.560 --> 46:40.560
By contemplating that designation

46:40.560 --> 46:42.560
is not a problem to begin with,

46:42.560 --> 46:44.560
you will learn to allow

46:44.560 --> 46:48.560
those more ambiguous,

46:48.560 --> 46:50.560
less palpable phenomena,

46:50.560 --> 46:51.560
so to speak,

46:51.560 --> 46:53.560
such as designations and turns,

46:53.560 --> 46:55.560
and signs and tokens,

46:55.560 --> 46:56.560
to exist,

46:56.560 --> 46:58.560
to arise.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.560
By not allowing them,

47:00.560 --> 47:01.560
you don't see them,

47:01.560 --> 47:02.560
or rather,

47:02.560 --> 47:04.560
by thinking they're the problem,

47:04.560 --> 47:05.560
by denying them,

47:05.560 --> 47:06.560
by blaming them,

47:06.560 --> 47:07.560
by undoing them,

47:07.560 --> 47:10.560
by whatever else people would do.

47:10.560 --> 47:13.560
Means you wouldn't see them in the nature,

47:13.560 --> 47:16.560
which means you're not seeing the nature of phenomena,

47:16.560 --> 47:18.560
which means you're not seeing

47:18.560 --> 47:21.560
the nature of arising.

47:21.560 --> 47:23.560
So,

47:23.560 --> 47:24.560
you could see the dharma

47:24.560 --> 47:26.560
by learning how not to interfere

47:26.560 --> 47:27.560
with the designations

47:27.560 --> 47:29.560
and what they designate.

47:29.560 --> 47:34.560
By not maintaining the blame on them

47:34.560 --> 47:35.560
for your suffering,

47:35.560 --> 47:37.560
but by learning how to leave it as it is,

47:37.560 --> 47:38.560
then eventually you'll see

47:38.560 --> 47:40.560
where the suffering does come from,

47:40.560 --> 47:41.560
which is not them.

47:41.560 --> 47:43.560
For as long as you think they're the problem,

47:43.560 --> 47:45.560
you'll be trying to fix them,

47:45.560 --> 47:48.560
which means you'll be misdirecting your efforts externally,

47:48.560 --> 47:51.560
outwardly.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.560
Not recognizing that there is a further suffering,

47:53.560 --> 47:56.560
as the sister,

47:56.560 --> 47:59.560
Roger Dunn said,

47:59.560 --> 48:00.560
merely the suffering arising,

48:00.560 --> 48:02.560
suffering standing.

48:02.560 --> 48:06.560
That's what the problem is.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.560
So,

48:08.560 --> 48:10.560
you don't have to worry about designations,

48:10.560 --> 48:13.560
as long as you're not spending your time blaming them

48:13.560 --> 48:15.560
for your suffering.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.560
And saying,

48:16.560 --> 48:18.560
well,

48:18.560 --> 48:20.560
I don't exist anyway.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.560
My name,

48:22.560 --> 48:24.560
my ethnicity,

48:24.560 --> 48:25.560
my nationality,

48:25.560 --> 48:28.560
just empty convention,

48:28.560 --> 48:29.560
it's not real,

48:29.560 --> 48:30.560
thus,

48:30.560 --> 48:31.560
when I experience pain,

48:31.560 --> 48:34.560
that's not real either.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.560
That's a completely gratuitous connection,

48:36.560 --> 48:38.560
and it doesn't work,

48:38.560 --> 48:42.560
which is why it doesn't feel from suffering.

48:42.560 --> 48:45.560
So, that's how.

48:45.560 --> 48:48.560
The designations cover quite a domain.

48:48.560 --> 48:50.560
Normal.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.560
Well,

48:51.560 --> 48:53.560
there is no just normal,

48:53.560 --> 48:56.560
or there is no just Rupa.

48:56.560 --> 48:57.560
So, everything is designated,

48:57.560 --> 48:58.560
that's what I'm saying.

48:58.560 --> 48:59.560
That's what I'm saying before.

48:59.560 --> 49:00.560
Even you saw,

49:00.560 --> 49:01.560
like,

49:01.560 --> 49:02.560
I'm not calling this,

49:02.560 --> 49:03.560
and you just called it,

49:03.560 --> 49:04.560
like,

49:04.560 --> 49:05.560
like that.

49:05.560 --> 49:06.560
I'm not going to giving any name to this.

49:06.560 --> 49:10.560
You just name this as such.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.560
So, name,

49:12.560 --> 49:13.560
as a name of matter,

49:13.560 --> 49:15.560
it's not optional.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.560
So, I'm doing the name.

49:16.560 --> 49:17.560
It's ridiculous.

49:17.560 --> 49:18.560
You cannot do the name

49:18.560 --> 49:22.560
or you cannot do the form.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.560
Because it's not you're doing anyway.

49:25.560 --> 49:26.560
Yes.

49:26.560 --> 49:29.560
Designation is not you're doing.

49:29.560 --> 49:31.560
Even if it's in regard to it,

49:31.560 --> 49:34.560
it is.

49:34.560 --> 49:35.560
But to see that,

49:35.560 --> 49:36.560
normal Rupa,

49:36.560 --> 49:37.560
not just normal.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.560
Yes, there is no just normal.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.560
I mean, you can discern the aspect of

49:41.560 --> 49:43.560
normal in normal Rupa.

49:43.560 --> 49:44.560
In the same sense,

49:44.560 --> 49:46.560
you can discern the resistance aspect

49:46.560 --> 49:48.560
of Rupa in normal Rupa,

49:48.560 --> 49:51.560
but there is no just normal just Rupa.

49:51.560 --> 49:53.560
And normal Rupa would,

49:53.560 --> 49:54.560
in other words,

49:54.560 --> 49:56.560
it's the all.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.560
There can also be appearance.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.560
Everything that appears,

50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
exactly.

50:01.560 --> 50:02.560
But,

50:02.560 --> 50:04.560
with wrong view,

50:04.560 --> 50:05.560
it exists.

50:05.560 --> 50:06.560
When it says,

50:06.560 --> 50:08.560
the all means everything.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.560
From things that's seemingly more material

50:10.560 --> 50:11.560
to like, you know,

50:11.560 --> 50:13.560
vague and biggest abstract thoughts.

50:13.560 --> 50:14.560
Again,

50:14.560 --> 50:15.560
that's as a designation,

50:15.560 --> 50:17.560
it has its matter,

50:17.560 --> 50:18.560
which is right here

50:18.560 --> 50:19.560
and then the presence of that living body

50:19.560 --> 50:21.560
or whatever else.

50:21.560 --> 50:22.560
The experience has a whole

50:22.560 --> 50:23.560
number of Rupa remains,

50:23.560 --> 50:24.560
and you can't even

50:24.560 --> 50:26.560
conceal that now being so.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.560
No,

50:27.560 --> 50:28.560
yes.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.560
Designation is just,

50:29.560 --> 50:30.560
it's not just label.

50:30.560 --> 50:31.560
No.

50:31.560 --> 50:32.560
It's a label.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.560
It's a designated designation.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.560
Are you labeled it intentionally

50:36.560 --> 50:37.560
intended something,

50:37.560 --> 50:40.560
decided on top of the already

50:40.560 --> 50:42.560
inclinations that you had?

50:42.560 --> 50:44.560
Oh, you think that's a label?

50:44.560 --> 50:45.560
Oh, this is,

50:45.560 --> 50:47.560
I call this table.

50:47.560 --> 50:49.560
I label it as such and such,

50:49.560 --> 50:52.560
in such and such regard.

50:52.560 --> 50:55.560
So that's just like a very proliferated designation,

50:55.560 --> 50:57.560
you can say.

50:57.560 --> 51:00.560
It still shares the same nature of designation.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.560
And if you realize the nature of designation,

51:02.560 --> 51:06.560
you will realize that labeling was never the problem.

51:06.560 --> 51:07.560
It's kind of inevitable.

51:07.560 --> 51:10.560
If you abstain from the label,

51:10.560 --> 51:12.560
you label it like that.

51:12.560 --> 51:13.560
In the same sense,

51:13.560 --> 51:14.560
you can't stop choosing,

51:14.560 --> 51:16.560
can't stop making decisions,

51:16.560 --> 51:17.560
receiving.

51:17.560 --> 51:18.560
You can't stop receiving.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.560
You can't stop feeling.

51:20.560 --> 51:22.560
Or you can do is,

51:22.560 --> 51:24.560
step outside of the whole thing.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.560
Or I would not step outside literally,

51:26.560 --> 51:28.560
but surmount the whole thing,

51:28.560 --> 51:31.560
so you're not affected by it.

51:31.560 --> 51:34.560
And as the weather said,

51:34.560 --> 51:36.560
even the target that uses designations

51:36.560 --> 51:37.560
such as I am,

51:37.560 --> 51:39.560
I am this, I was like that.

51:39.560 --> 51:41.560
But he does not confuse that designation

51:41.560 --> 51:43.560
for his sense of self.

51:43.560 --> 51:45.560
It does not stand anymore

51:45.560 --> 51:48.560
for the wrong view of the self.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.560
He is clearly there.

51:50.560 --> 51:51.560
So now it's a true,

51:51.560 --> 51:53.560
just an empty designation,

51:53.560 --> 51:54.560
in that sense,

51:54.560 --> 51:55.560
not empty of everything,

51:55.560 --> 51:56.560
empty of its reality.

51:56.560 --> 51:59.560
It's empty of appropriation.

51:59.560 --> 52:04.560
So when, so when,

52:04.560 --> 52:07.560
I saw his bonuses,

52:07.560 --> 52:09.560
not mine.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.560
He doesn't take that,

52:11.560 --> 52:13.560
knowledge as he is.

52:13.560 --> 52:16.560
But therefore in our hands,

52:16.560 --> 52:18.560
he doesn't say not mine.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.560
He doesn't have to say that.

52:19.560 --> 52:20.560
He doesn't have to say that.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.560
He doesn't have to say that.

52:22.560 --> 52:25.560
He doesn't have to say that.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.560
But what puttuja Nakando,

52:27.560 --> 52:28.560
he can deny the whole world,

52:28.560 --> 52:29.560
say it's not mine.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.560
But what he cannot see

52:31.560 --> 52:32.560
is not mine,

52:32.560 --> 52:37.560
he's actually denying the whole world.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.560
But as though he can see himself

52:39.560 --> 52:40.560
with not self,

52:40.560 --> 52:42.560
he can see not self with self.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.560
He can see himself with self.

52:44.560 --> 52:47.560
But he can't see him not self with not self.

52:47.560 --> 52:48.560
So then again,

52:48.560 --> 52:50.560
which is why he's suffering?

52:50.560 --> 52:51.560
Yeah.

52:51.560 --> 52:54.560
The male what arises,

52:54.560 --> 52:57.560
it's not appropriation.

52:57.560 --> 52:59.560
It's not his.

52:59.560 --> 53:00.560
So he sees not self,

53:00.560 --> 53:01.560
not self,

53:01.560 --> 53:02.560
not self.

53:02.560 --> 53:04.560
And he needs to persist in it,

53:04.560 --> 53:05.560
so the things

53:05.560 --> 53:07.560
won't even arise anymore

53:07.560 --> 53:15.560
with the author of self.

53:15.560 --> 53:18.560
That's the standing of determining.

53:18.560 --> 53:47.560
Yeah, you can say so.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.560
And if you were,

53:49.560 --> 53:54.560
because if you were not able to designate,

53:54.560 --> 53:57.560
you'd be dead.

53:57.560 --> 54:03.560
But that's not Nirvana.

54:03.560 --> 54:06.560
And actually there is that,

54:06.560 --> 54:08.560
that sort of, yeah,

54:08.560 --> 54:09.560
it says if an infert,

54:09.560 --> 54:12.560
if the consciousness turns away

54:12.560 --> 54:15.560
from the name and form,

54:15.560 --> 54:20.560
wood.

54:20.560 --> 54:22.560
Oh yeah.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.560
It's based on the resistance and designation.

54:25.560 --> 54:29.560
A lot about that.

54:29.560 --> 54:38.560
Yeah.

54:38.560 --> 54:40.560
With name and matter as condition,

54:40.560 --> 54:41.560
consciousness.

54:41.560 --> 54:42.560
So it was said,

54:42.560 --> 54:45.560
how it is, and under that with name and matter as condition,

54:45.560 --> 54:46.560
there is consciousness.

54:46.560 --> 54:48.560
It should be seen in this manner.

54:48.560 --> 54:49.560
Even on the consciousness,

54:49.560 --> 54:51.560
but not to obtain a stay in name and matter,

54:51.560 --> 54:53.560
wood future arising,

54:53.560 --> 54:55.560
coming into being of birth,

54:55.560 --> 54:56.560
aging death,

54:56.560 --> 54:57.560
and pleasure suffering,

54:57.560 --> 54:58.560
be manifest,

54:58.560 --> 54:59.560
you wouldn't.

54:59.560 --> 55:00.560
So therefore,

55:00.560 --> 55:01.560
that's the reason,

55:01.560 --> 55:02.560
that's the occasion,

55:02.560 --> 55:03.560
that it's the arising,

55:03.560 --> 55:05.560
that this is the condition of consciousness

55:05.560 --> 55:06.560
that's the same name and matter.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.560
Thus far and under,

55:07.560 --> 55:08.560
may one be born,

55:08.560 --> 55:09.560
or aged,

55:09.560 --> 55:10.560
or die,

55:10.560 --> 55:11.560
or fall,

55:11.560 --> 55:12.560
that's far,

55:12.560 --> 55:13.560
is there a way of designation,

55:13.560 --> 55:15.560
as far as designations can go.

55:15.560 --> 55:17.560
Thus far there is a way of language,

55:17.560 --> 55:19.560
thus far there is a way of description,

55:19.560 --> 55:21.560
thus far there is a sphere of understanding,

55:21.560 --> 55:23.560
thus far the round precedes

55:23.560 --> 55:25.560
as manifestation in a situation.

55:25.560 --> 55:26.560
So far,

55:26.560 --> 55:27.560
that is to say,

55:27.560 --> 55:29.560
as there is name and matter,

55:29.560 --> 55:36.560
together with consciousness.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.560
And for other rounds,

55:38.560 --> 55:39.560
like here at the end of the day,

55:39.560 --> 55:41.560
they say the same name.

55:41.560 --> 55:42.560
They say the same name,

55:42.560 --> 55:43.560
but they might.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.560
Yeah, well, the faculty is a different,

55:45.560 --> 55:46.560
more limited and so on,

55:46.560 --> 55:48.560
so they wouldn't have...

55:48.560 --> 55:50.560
They don't have the confidence in themselves.

55:50.560 --> 55:51.560
The theory of awareness.

55:51.560 --> 55:52.560
Yeah, but,

55:52.560 --> 55:53.560
animal,

55:53.560 --> 55:54.560
they might not be able to speak,

55:54.560 --> 55:55.560
but they have,

55:55.560 --> 55:58.560
that which stands in the form of speech.

55:58.560 --> 55:59.560
The sounds they make,

55:59.560 --> 56:00.560
the expressions,

56:00.560 --> 56:02.560
and it's a form of,

56:02.560 --> 56:03.560
it's much more obviously crude,

56:03.560 --> 56:05.560
simpler, more general,

56:05.560 --> 56:06.560
animal,

56:06.560 --> 56:07.560
but the far hungry,

56:07.560 --> 56:08.560
it's a far hungry,

56:08.560 --> 56:09.560
and the round,

56:09.560 --> 56:10.560
be it a deva round,

56:10.560 --> 56:11.560
or the,

56:11.560 --> 56:12.560
or the,

56:12.560 --> 56:13.560
animal round,

56:13.560 --> 56:15.560
or the hero round,

56:15.560 --> 56:18.560
there is no.

56:18.560 --> 56:19.560
Absence of,

56:19.560 --> 56:20.560
well, like,

56:20.560 --> 56:21.560
oh, I have only two aggregates,

56:21.560 --> 56:22.560
but something on it.

56:22.560 --> 56:23.560
Just the far right,

56:23.560 --> 56:26.560
it's the nature of things.

56:26.560 --> 56:27.560
It's just their composition,

56:27.560 --> 56:28.560
the ways of going about,

56:28.560 --> 56:30.560
might be different for an animal,

56:30.560 --> 56:31.560
than a human,

56:31.560 --> 56:32.560
which is why an animal

56:32.560 --> 56:33.560
is more unfortunate,

56:33.560 --> 56:35.560
than a human.

56:35.560 --> 56:37.560
But it's still the same deva.

56:37.560 --> 56:38.560
And that's why,

56:38.560 --> 56:39.560
it's,

56:39.560 --> 56:40.560
it's such a perilous round

56:40.560 --> 56:42.560
to be an animal round.

56:42.560 --> 56:43.560
You don't have awareness

56:43.560 --> 56:44.560
of your choice,

56:44.560 --> 56:45.560
yet you are choosing,

56:45.560 --> 56:46.560
and you're fully responsible

56:46.560 --> 56:48.560
for the results of that choice.

56:48.560 --> 56:50.560
So an animal can't help,

56:50.560 --> 56:52.560
dog can't help but chase after things,

56:52.560 --> 56:53.560
or hunt things,

56:53.560 --> 56:56.560
cat can't help but killing.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.560
But it's still responsible for it.

56:58.560 --> 56:59.560
Doesn't mean,

56:59.560 --> 57:00.560
oh, it can't help,

57:00.560 --> 57:01.560
it's not a fault,

57:01.560 --> 57:02.560
it is a fault.

57:02.560 --> 57:03.560
The far right,

57:03.560 --> 57:04.560
it's a,

57:04.560 --> 57:06.560
it is a form of choice.

57:06.560 --> 57:07.560
Yet,

57:07.560 --> 57:09.560
there is not enough awareness

57:09.560 --> 57:11.560
for that choice to be recognized,

57:11.560 --> 57:12.560
so they just go

57:12.560 --> 57:15.560
with the most obvious inclination

57:15.560 --> 57:16.560
that they would have,

57:16.560 --> 57:18.560
which is why it's so hard to step

57:18.560 --> 57:19.560
outside of the animal round,

57:19.560 --> 57:20.560
because you're just perpetuating

57:20.560 --> 57:21.560
the bad action,

57:21.560 --> 57:22.560
action,

57:22.560 --> 57:24.560
action fully immersed,

57:24.560 --> 57:25.560
in greed,

57:25.560 --> 57:26.560
aversion, delusion,

57:26.560 --> 57:27.560
completely.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.560
So you would really need

57:29.560 --> 57:31.560
an external circumstances,

57:31.560 --> 57:32.560
a stroke of luck

57:32.560 --> 57:34.560
to get back from an animal round,

57:34.560 --> 57:36.560
for which,

57:36.560 --> 57:37.560
you're responsible going to,

57:37.560 --> 57:38.560
in the first place,

57:38.560 --> 57:39.560
through your bad actions

57:39.560 --> 57:40.560
in other,

57:40.560 --> 57:41.560
better out.

57:41.560 --> 57:42.560
And that stroke of luck

57:42.560 --> 57:43.560
is basically,

57:43.560 --> 57:44.560
that simulator

57:44.560 --> 57:45.560
of the blind third

57:45.560 --> 57:46.560
coming up,

57:46.560 --> 57:48.560
once every 500 years,

57:48.560 --> 57:50.560
to the top of the sea,

57:50.560 --> 57:51.560
just for a second,

57:51.560 --> 57:53.560
and sticking its head

57:53.560 --> 57:54.560
to a yoke

57:54.560 --> 57:55.560
that's been floating around

57:55.560 --> 57:56.560
and thrown around

57:56.560 --> 57:57.560
by winds and waves.

57:57.560 --> 57:59.560
I mean, what are the chances?

57:59.560 --> 58:00.560
And those are the chances

58:00.560 --> 58:01.560
of somebody

58:01.560 --> 58:02.560
from an animal round

58:02.560 --> 58:05.560
to come back.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.560
So that's why, like,

58:07.560 --> 58:09.560
there is some, like,

58:09.560 --> 58:11.560
looking after an animal,

58:11.560 --> 58:12.560
helping an animal,

58:12.560 --> 58:13.560
feeding it,

58:13.560 --> 58:16.560
does, in a sense,

58:16.560 --> 58:18.560
like, by making an animal

58:18.560 --> 58:20.560
restrained itself.

58:20.560 --> 58:21.560
And nature restrained

58:21.560 --> 58:22.560
is there,

58:22.560 --> 58:23.560
in its behavior,

58:23.560 --> 58:24.560
and it's such,

58:24.560 --> 58:25.560
it will count,

58:25.560 --> 58:27.560
bit by bit,

58:27.560 --> 58:28.560
eventually,

58:28.560 --> 58:30.560
in the future.

58:30.560 --> 58:31.560
Yeah,

58:31.560 --> 58:32.560
they're not,

58:32.560 --> 58:33.560
they're not,

58:33.560 --> 58:34.560
they're not,

58:34.560 --> 58:35.560
they didn't willingly

58:35.560 --> 58:36.560
choose that restraint.

58:36.560 --> 58:37.560
By the fact that the restraint

58:37.560 --> 58:38.560
was imposed upon them,

58:38.560 --> 58:40.560
in the sense of weight

58:40.560 --> 58:42.560
before you jump on your food.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.560
Means, there is a phenomenon

58:44.560 --> 58:45.560
always strained present

58:45.560 --> 58:46.560
in their experience

58:46.560 --> 58:48.560
right there, right then.

58:48.560 --> 58:51.560
A wholesome phenomenon present.

58:51.560 --> 58:52.560
And what I said,

58:52.560 --> 58:54.560
in these unwholesome rounds,

58:54.560 --> 58:55.560
like,

58:55.560 --> 58:57.560
completely always in darkness,

58:57.560 --> 58:59.560
even a tiny little spark

58:59.560 --> 59:01.560
light can mean,

59:01.560 --> 59:02.560
a lot.

59:16.560 --> 59:18.560
That's what I look after, though.

59:18.560 --> 59:19.560
In cats,

59:19.560 --> 59:20.560
in a bird,

59:20.560 --> 59:29.560
in a monkey.
