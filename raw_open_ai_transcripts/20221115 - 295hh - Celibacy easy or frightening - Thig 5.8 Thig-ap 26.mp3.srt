1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,800
So, these are a few questions, and I've got this one, and I've got this one, and I've

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:45,400
got it up. I have been celibate for some time, and now have the fear that I will lose it.

3
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,920
My mind is full of fear and has no peace. Yet peace is what I expected to get from celibacy.

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
What am I doing wrong?

5
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Well, you get peace from losing desire towards sensuality. You don't get peace for celibacy

6
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,000
if you still value sensuality. So, celibacy is a necessary prerequisite to lose the desire

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,920
towards sensuality. But if you don't work on that part, mental part of your attraction

8
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,840
to sensual objects, celibacy will free you and give you. Well, it will give you certainly

9
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,400
a less disturbing life, a less engaging life, less entanglement in life, not engaging physically

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,480
with sensuality. It's factually less entangling. But yes, if you still value sensuality, value

11
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:50,120
sensual objects, saying no to them will hurt. So, did that person expect celibacy to do

12
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,920
the work for him? So, if I'm celibate, if I just abstain from this, sensuality will

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,040
magically evaporate from my mind. Or did they also on top of that sensory strength, virtue,

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,280
celibacy, then make the effort to see the peril in sens objects, to see the peril in

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,800
desire. If not, then the peace they were hoping to get on account of celibacy alone, it's

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,240
kind of on the level of sensual satisfaction again. They were hoping that they will have

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:29,080
this pleasure of a peaceful experience because they're not engaging sexually anymore. But

18
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,960
that's not how it works. That would be too easy. That would be too easy. Just be celibate

19
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,200
with that said, you're an out of hand. But no, you have to be, you want to be an out

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,920
of hand. But in and of itself, it will not result in the unshakable peace. But factually,

21
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,520
as I said, it will still result in less entanglement. So, focusing that on the benefits

22
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,040
of doing it, don't just hope that it will do the work for you while you mentally still

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,960
value the sensual objects. So, once you're celibate, are you now spending your time contemplating

24
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:13,160
the danger of sens desire, the lack of satisfaction, the context of entanglement and disentanglement,

25
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,480
the value of this entanglement? Are you making the effort on that mental level now that you

26
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,480
created the basis through celibacy and virtue? Or are you just celibate and then just sort

27
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:33,520
of threading water, just waiting for the work to magically be presented as completed?

28
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,440
It's similar to someone who is like just doing, taking on the rules, taking on certain

29
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,960
reasons and then hoping that. Yeah, okay. So, I understand now my duties to be celibate,

30
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,200
okay, I'm celibate, okay. So, where's the peace? It won't come as a result of it because

31
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,920
you haven't taken it rightly. You take celibacy so that you can tame your mind. You don't take

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,720
celibacy because that will do the work for you. So, remind yourself for the reasons

33
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,120
you're wanting to practice, keep that context, work on it. It's again, it's the similar

34
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,040
of light in the sticks, you have fire sticks, light in the fire with the sticks while you're

35
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,800
in the water. So, you can then, you realize, I have to come out of this river in order

36
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,240
to sort of rub the sticks to get the fire. But if you just come out of the river and

37
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,440
you make no effort to rub the sticks to light the fire, well, you won't get the fire. You

38
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,880
still won't get the original result that made you come out of the water. But you have.

39
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,720
But you have to come out of the water. So, that's a celibacy. It's not optional for

40
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,280
somebody who wants to practice really for the results. But then, once you celebrate,

41
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,160
that's not the end of the practice. Coming out of the water, yeah. Now, learning to

42
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,840
light the fire and making the effort to dry the sticks, not soak them, not keep them in

43
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,720
touch with water, even if you're out. In other words, stop valuing sensuality, stop hoping

44
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,920
for some degree of central pleasures after I become peaceful and so on, you have to say

45
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,080
no to that entire domain. And you would say no, not by kind of all just decide to say

46
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,760
no, but by contemplating the factual danger of it, the factual lack of satisfaction,

47
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,840
the factual perpetuation of the problem and on peace. And that in and of itself would

48
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,960
be enough, actually, to already start seeing the benefits of being celibate, for example.

49
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,600
And the dangers of not. And the dangers of not. Even if you don't get some higher results,

50
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:41,280
you still recognize, well, yeah, it's still factually. And more freedom comes that way.

51
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:52,680
So a question that's related to this. Now that I'm old, celibacy is quite easy. All

52
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,520
of my previous passions have faded and now I dwell equanimous to most things. Most, but

53
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,040
I fear that sickness and death will still be suffering for me. What should I do next?

54
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,160
I think what should I do first is more likely, or you should ask, because celibacy and freedom

55
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,440
from sensuality does not come with old age by default. As I said before, it goes underground

56
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,480
with old age by default means you think now it's not there, because it's too far gone

57
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:31,320
to see it. And the reminders of it still being there are like hard to spot because,

58
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,480
you know, the vitality, the strength of the senses, the zeal, it's gone. It's just tired

59
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,280
to trade it. But the attitude, the assumption of what where the last is, where the attraction

60
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,840
is, where the desires are being satisfied, that's still there. And that's now much harder

61
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:56,280
to see and uproot. Because if the person then gets sick, if the person is truly economist,

62
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,760
then losing the prospect of losing the body even more.

63
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,480
Exactly. If you truly practice celibacy to its fulfillment, i.e. abandoning of central

64
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:11,200
desires, a prospect of sickness and death would not be frightening at all. And you would

65
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,040
not even be doubtful about it. Because that, which is going to be wiped away with sickness

66
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,520
and death, is that which you seemingly have no desire towards anymore.

67
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,200
So now your senses that you're still very much bound with are even more invisible. Remember

68
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,960
we spoke in previous talks, senses, sense organs that are always like negative, that

69
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,560
a negative space in regard to what you look, see, smell, taste, touch. So it is defined

70
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,200
in return by sight, sound, smell, taste touches. That is how you can infer and discern that

71
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:52,760
organs are there. Now, since sight, sight, smell, taste touches have been bombarding

72
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,360
you for decades and decades and decades and fatigue and you have no more inspirational

73
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,520
strength and like joy towards the pleasures, you just tie it. You just rather not be bothered

74
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:13,240
means your negative spaces of your senses will be even more invisible now. Because they're

75
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,160
factually not being as defined as before, which is what people confuse as peace. Oh,

76
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,040
look, I'm not disturbed as much as I was before. Yeah, because you can't know it. But if you

77
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,520
truly want to see if you're peaceful or not, well, contemplating losing the dear ones,

78
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,040
the loved ones, experiencing misfortune, can you still experience things on account of

79
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:40,160
or of any kind of anything that could happen to this body, sickness, aging, paddles of

80
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,640
that kind, would you equally remain unperturbed if you live a dying next moment? If not, means

81
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Oh, okay. So you missed the opportunity to approve the dependence on the negative sense

82
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,560
organs, negative spaces of the sense organs. So now it's going to be even harder. So I

83
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,680
guess what you could do is again, spend every minute of your life contemplating the value

84
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:13,840
of virtue, sensory strain, practice generosity. Don't give rise to thoughts of ill will,

85
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:22,880
thoughts of harm. Don't give rise to the sense of false complacency and safety. One account

86
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,240
of things not disturbing you much. And then if you were truly free, you have nothing to

87
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,440
lose with all these practices. If you were not truly free, well, you were really soon

88
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,680
enough with all these practices. Because also eating, a person could take on certain. Yeah,

89
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,040
yeah, the reasons for the eating practice increased moderation in eating to put it that way. Because

90
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,240
that's still something that people really get into pleasure from. Yeah. I can't have this

91
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:02,120
sexual part anymore. Sure. But sounds, food, food, comfort, physical comfort, being sheltered

92
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,400
from the elements. And I don't mean like, you know, go and live outside blizzard or something,

93
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:15,080
but how soft is your bed? How soft are pillows? How warm are your blankets? All of that,

94
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,520
the purpose is one and only is to bright comfort for the body, for the sense organs that you

95
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,320
still are. So would you be disturbed on account of losing those things? An account of maybe

96
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:32,760
saying no to a degree and sleep on a harder bed, without a pillow. How miserable you'll

97
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,600
be next day if you didn't have proper night of comfortable sleep. So you can still practice

98
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,160
within that, even if you waited, because you know, there was that old lady, a whole past

99
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:53,840
80 or whatever in the suitors that was had what I think two sons, husband, lots of wealth,

100
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,920
husband passed away. She thought, Hey, why don't I give my wealth to my two sons and

101
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,240
their families? And they look after me. So she gave all of her wealth, house everything

102
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,160
to the two sons. And then from, you know, she was spent time with one, then going to spend

103
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,560
time with the other. And on one occasion, when she was like that, arriving at a one sons

104
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,560
house, before she could she overheard him saying, Oh, there she is coming again. Like,

105
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,480
well, she has the other son, doesn't she, you know, the wife complaining or something.

106
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,120
So she was heartbroken. The fact that they actually started despising her when she factually

107
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,040
gave it all away. So he left, she left, saw the nuns getting sheltered in the food. I

108
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,840
thought, Well, how might this will become an answer? I can at least have someone to sleep

109
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,280
and eat. So she didn't even want to practice. She was old. She couldn't go pin the butt

110
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,920
because she was old. She was just would clean up the place when the younger nuns go pin

111
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,760
the part prepared everything when they bring the food. She was just like a servant there.

112
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,520
And once she overheard one nun talk to the other about the some aspect of the dama that

113
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,960
they heard from the Buddha. And then at night when she finished all of her chores, she couldn't

114
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,240
even do the walking meditation straight, because she was old. She was walking up and

115
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,360
down the corridor, propped with against the wall and contemplating what she heard. And

116
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:21,240
she became out of hand. So it is still possible. But you do really have to commit to it like

117
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:33,800
it is your last chance because it might well be for a long, long time.
