WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
And again, I don't dare to tradition it, but in the West, it's the same.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
It's just in regard to different things, maybe more specific views as opposed to generic tradition.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
But it's the same.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
If you get very upset, you point out, and the fact that you get upset on account of your downward view,

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
if you don't see that as a big problem, as there's nothing else you can really discuss with that person.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah, I can get upset, you know, you find me, you kick my doll, you do this, you do that.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
But if you disagree with my downward views, if that bothers me,

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
it means, well, those are not the views of downward, it's that simple.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
But yeah, it's remarkable, how far people would go.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Kind of knowing that, but ignoring it.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
You know what I mean?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, people hold to views so strong, and in the West, definitely as much as any place.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
And it means that how strong this objective, this type of attitude is.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
But maybe in America, especially, because it's like a sensualism.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
I think it's Western culture generally, because any of these individuals write the education,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
mainly, the way you grow up, the way you're taught in schools and stuff,

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
you just end up being, and no doubt, involuntarily, they're not aware of it themselves.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
But you end up being channeled in the direction of that kind of objective sort of materialistic view,

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
whereby, you know, if you really commit to it, you come to a point where you think your thoughts don't exist.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
That's not the real thing. The real thing is only thing that is accessible to five senses,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
things that you can see.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
If you were to stop and think about what the senses are, you'll get very confused.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
So you wouldn't do it, you'll just keep going forward into the things, into the science, into the other things.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Are there in the world, basically?

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Which is all based on the assumption that the world is there, independent of you.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Which is the wrong assumption, because, you know, either the assumption, you need to exist first.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
So it's a contradictory assumption.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
And that was the main, like, a line of existentialism, such as existence precedes the essence.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
That's just the big, you know, whatever, whatever.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
I think it takes us, we need to come back to this first principle, that existence precedes the essence.

02:32.000 --> 02:42.000
So you can't provide explanation, you can't develop an external view that will sort of then in return define your existence.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Or something, why? Because you need to exist first, in order to do any of that.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Which means that's all secondary, which means you cannot stand for existence.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Obviously, they couldn't go further than that.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
That's a huge change that happened to me, you know, to be honest.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
It just twisted everything around suddenly.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
These things make more sense to this world.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I thought it was so real.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
And I'm just, you know, one little thing in this world that's real is,

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I know the world through my own, through experience.

03:16.000 --> 03:26.000
So, experience is more fundamental than the objects that I'm really just creating a model of a world that I might experience.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Yeah, it's determined.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
Inasmuch, the objects of your senses define the domain of your sense.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
In that sense, they are also determined by those senses now.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
So, you know, if your eyes are not working on limited or whatever,

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
they will limit the whole domain, the whole world of vision.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Everything you've ever seen, everything you will see, everything you see.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Same with any other sense.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
And it is just that little material organ.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
Sitting in the world, same as that cup, same as that bin, same as the stone, eyes.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
But as Annabella said, causing that sort of thing.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Well, yeah, it's like that.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
It's just that they have this privileged position of, it's an object in the world,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
because of which there are objects in the world, because of which you see objects in the world.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
But it's an object in the world.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
So, the practice is really to remove that privilege from your senses, from your sense-bases.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
And which is why whenever they've described, they've described in that kind of external terms,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
as a fresh eye in organs and so on, because that's what they are.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
They can't be more than that.

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
That's the instrument in the world by which you are the perceiver and the conceiver of the world.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
I think this weird thing happening in this minute, I'm not used to meditating so much,

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
so I don't know if it probably doesn't mean anything, but that's a couple of days.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
When my eyes are open and unseen things, sometimes it feels like I'm not looking,

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm not seeing objects, I'm seeing images of objects.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
Well, that can be, I mean, a computer screen or something.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah, well, for as long as, when you say you're seeing images of objects,

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
the objects that are now pushed in a background are not regarded as more real or more fundamental

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
than the images of them that you see.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
Because that's the problem that the assumption can kind of take up anything in that sense.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, these are just images. Well, if you say, well, your mind comes first,

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
and people can get the hint of that, that the mind basically determines the experience as such,

05:54.000 --> 06:04.000
internal or external, but because just that kind of little taste, little glimpse of that insight, so to speak,

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
the assumption takes it up and then you kind of overshoot the mark and then you end up

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
everything is in my mind, like solipses or no idea, the world is just in me,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
but you don't exist just in my head, kind of thing.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
But that you can see that being remotely rooted in something that resembles the truth,

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
but actually they overshoot them and I was just a view that misrepresents.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
So if you see the images of objects, well, that's what's real for you at a time of seeing.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
So then the background of the objects just becomes another possibility of those objects.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
In other words, the objects now that are pushed to the side because you've seen the image,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
become possibility away that those objects can appear again.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Because now you see them as images, and you see them as non-image, you see them as the real object,

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
they're just their modes of manifesting, and they're all equally real as such in their own domain.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
So it's not that the real objects are more real than images,

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
because if you stop and you worry, even the real object is a metal image.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
Not entirely, it's founded upon the four great elements,

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
but if that image is not there, you wouldn't be able to even designate it as an object.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You just couldn't.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
And that is actually again, that can be a very good practice,

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
even the external things, the things that clearly define the things that you access through your senses,

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
to start recognizing the mental presence in them,

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
and not just default to an assumption that they are solid objects out there,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
the way you see them in the scene.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
So it doesn't mean that there is a hidden reality behind them,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
they're real, whichever way they appear,

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
but you can't even conceive the idea of appearance if it's not mental.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Right.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
If it doesn't take, at least to some extent, in a domain of mental and mentality.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
There has to be some, yeah, all that other stuff.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Today I had a strange thing,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
or the meditation has been very mild, I think,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
because tired or something.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
Today my mind is wandering a bit, and I would have like an image just popped in my head,

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
in this case, it was like a bullet ice cream.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
And all it wants, all together, the image, the intense image,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
and then sort of the awareness that I was aware of it,

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
and then this flame of desire, you know, craving,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
and then pleasure, strong pleasure.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
And it just sort of push all at once,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
and three, four, five seconds later, it just disappeared.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You know, and I went on to something else,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
but that was very interesting,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
and I started to play with that a little bit,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
because it was not an overwhelming kind of loss.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
But there was one reason it was interesting,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
is because I could really feel the feeling,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
the pleasure of feeling, and a lot of things.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Well, there was the pure kind of example of delight,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
sensual delight, which is entirely mental.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Your senses, they recognize agreeable and disagreeable,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
the five senses, and with a said, they're like five animals,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
they have their domains, they want to feed in grounds,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
how they call them, and they want to go after

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
what they like to eat, so to speak.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
So the eyes go out the pleasant sights,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
but that's only to a certain extent,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
the actual notion of sensuality,

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
and the delight in central pleasures.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
That's what keeps you bound to them.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
It's not that the existence of the five senses is the problem.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
So, and that's when you start to recognize,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
by seeing that delight, how actually,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
it's the mental take on pleasure,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
the associated with the senses,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
that keeps you kind of enslaved to them,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
not the actual plane.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
So, Arahand Kuddi, the nice, his favorite one,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
but he will not induce their mental delight anymore.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
That doesn't mean that he won't feel any pleasure

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
of that pleasant agreeable taste,

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
but for the arising, for the ceasing,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
and for the persisting of that pleasure,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
at any time, he won't feel any delight,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
associated with it.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
And that's another thing that comes down to what I said,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
when you have to start recognizing the mental image,

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
the presentation, the dharma, basically.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
In your thoughts, n, in things that you access through your senses,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
because they are determined as such,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
because of the mind.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
So, if you recognize the image in any ice cream,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
and then the real ice cream,

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
they're having common that they both appeared mentally.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
In a way, as a presentation of an ice cream,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
as an image of an ice cream,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
as a phenomenon of an ice cream,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
and that's where the practice needs to pertain.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
So, it can't pertain just to you,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
originally, like dismissing your thoughts,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
or just thinking, or thinking this in response to that,

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
or whatever.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Nor can it pertain only to that which concerns the senses.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
No, just say no to everything.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Just do not engage in any agreeable sense experience

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
it's not necessarily central, because it will miss the point.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
But if you fear mind on the level of that mental presentation,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
that dharma, that phenomenon,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
that's in common to both,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
then you'll be free from both whichever it is,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
whether you think about an ice cream,

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
or you're actually eating the ice cream,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
it will not induce delight,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
which is that which keeps you bound,

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
which is why its centrality is unwholesome.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah, because usually people are saying,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
ah, thinking is the problem,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
because when I think about it,

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I'll get all bound up,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
so I'll stop thinking about it.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
But then, yeah, you might do that one,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
but you won't be always able to stop thinking about it,

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
and then when you do come,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
because ice cream, you just,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
well, they won't be much restraint.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Even if you're restraint,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
even if you're just moderate,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
and you just eat one spoon a day,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
still, you eat that one spoon a day with delight.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Even if you eat no spoon at all,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
you will have delight in the experience.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Which is why a satisism,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
per se, is wrong,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
when people just,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
the simile of the deer,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
the herd,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
and imagine what I think in the beginning fourth,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
fifth shooter,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
when it says,

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
the first group of deer,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
eats the bait,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
the maralais,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
and where they just eat it.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
They don't think well.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Because that maralais does whatever he wants.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
The second group of deer,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
they see the first group,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
and then they blame the bait,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
so then they completely shun the bait,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
and they run into the mountains,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
when there's no bait around to provoke them.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
But after a while,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
their energy, you know, goes down,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
not enough food,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
then they come back,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
and they eat the bait,

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
unwarily.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
And then the third group sees the third group,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
and says, well, what if we stay among the bait,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
but eat carefully?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And then,

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
they do that,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
and then the mara,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
the hunter comes,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
and he sees the bait eaten,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
but nothing is caught on the bait.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
So he can't see those deer anymore.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
They come and eat his bait,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
but he can't catch them.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
So then,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
then it says in the suit,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
so then the mara decides to leave them alone,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
not try to harass him further,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
in case he harasses them further.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
They'll start telling everybody else

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
how to avoid his bait.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And then,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
it's a comparison to,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
kind of, obviously,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
essentially, Dalgons,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
and then the formal set,

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
which is, kind of,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
a default mode for many monks,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
and many people,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
all this volume,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
you know, just kind of determination,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
and just say no to everything.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And you can spend your whole life doing it.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And, you know, you might not be, kind of,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
wearing a, going around naked,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
like, does a set,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
or wearing a good bag,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
or sleeping in thorns,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and torturing yourself.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
But the fact that your mental attitude,

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
denies the bait,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
blames the bait,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
means,

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
you're not escaping it.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah, you're still hooked on it.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah, exactly.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And it's impossible, really,

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
for anyone in our heart,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
as well, to,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
you can't,

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
not have experience,

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
pain and pleasure.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
That's true.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And so that's what I mean.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
That's the,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
the wisdom of Finara

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
is found in a completely different direction,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
or in the middle direction,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
which is basically,

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
saying yes to the bait,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
saying no to the bait.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
What does it have in common?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Any of these reactions.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
It has in common,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
the phenomenon of the bait.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
If I free my mind

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
in regard to the phenomenon of the bait,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
if I see it as in permanent,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
as disagreeable,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
and as something that cannot be appropriated,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
and practice the long enough,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
whether you're among the bait,

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
or without the bait,

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
you'll be fine.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Because there was never a problem.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Right.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Who would say,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
that's what delight is.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Hmm.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Thinking that it's.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Well, delight, you can do.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
It's actually,

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
it's delight.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Delighting in the idea

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
of engaging in something

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
with your senses,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
whether it's this pleasant taste,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
pleasant sight, pleasant delight,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
and allowing your mind

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
to be overtaken by that,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
means you're delighting.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
If falling into it,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
means you're.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Well, it means you're,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
you're, you're hooked onto the bait.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
So, but if you remove the delight,

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
the bait can stay.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It can be right in front of your face,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
if you're not pressured into biting it.

16:08.000 --> 16:15.000
And you, you remove that by understanding objects.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Well, no, by understanding both.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It's your sense.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
By understanding the phenomena

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
that's in common,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
to the objects,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
whether externally,

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
internally or internally,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
externally.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Understanding what appears.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Phenomenological, yes.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Not explaining it

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
in terms of, oh,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
this is only permanent,

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
this ice cream, you know,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
it's going to melt,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
it's going to disappear in the sun,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
it's never real.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
No.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
An image of an ice cream,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
an image of pleasant taste,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
an image of a pleasant sight,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
pleasant touch,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
that enchants.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
That has in common,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
in your mind,

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
with the actual image,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
even if you're not actually looking at somebody

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
or something,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
eating something,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
those things are,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
so you don't need exposure

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
to centrality in order to define centrality,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
because it's defined by your mind.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So, you actually need to draw from it

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
in order to see that,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
like the main,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
the main reason for being centrally bound

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
is your mind,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
your mental assumption,

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
in regard to it.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Then you approve that,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
and then it's fine,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
even if you have things right

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
up front to you.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
So,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
it comes down to,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
being able to either think,

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
or directly experience

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
through the senses,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
a pleasant thing,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
and not be taken by it,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
being able to think,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
or directly experience the senses,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
unpleasant thing,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
and not feel aversion towards it,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
in terms of this kind of pressing

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
need to get rid of it.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
How would I look to you?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Extends down to what we spoke before,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
about the neutrophilic,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
which is where people,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
well, people don't see it.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So, usually that's what's associated

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
with boredom or the indolence.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
So, you need excitement,

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
or you need,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
well, you need anything, really.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So, when you don't feel anything,

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
you don't want to be resting

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
on that feeling either.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And that's the important bit.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
That's a subtle one.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
Yeah, it's a form of delight.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I earned this rest.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
You did.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
You might have earned physical rest,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
but you've never earned,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
unless you're another

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
mental rest.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
And by mental rest, I mean,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
giving in.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Like, when they both together,

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
similarly, of cow,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
with open wounds,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
if it lays on the ground,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
it's eaten by the insects on the ground.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
If it lays on the tree,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
or a wall,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
it's eaten by the insects,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
they live there.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
So, whatever,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
whatever it chooses to,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
whew, rest just for a second,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
it's being eaten by that.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
That's the attitude you need to develop.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Mentally.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Obviously, people, again,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
they overshoot

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
the assumption of the mind.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
And so, you end up thinking,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
it's just this constant tension

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
that you have to live through.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
But it's not.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You can set your body to sleep.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Feed it.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Take it for a walk.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Send it for a swing, whatever.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
Mentally, don't rest upon any of those actions.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And don't rest,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
means, don't lose mindfulness

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
in regard to it, basically.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Don't let your mind overtake it.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And you forget about yourself.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
And then you really

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
are taken by what you're doing.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Even if it's not unwholesome.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
It's unwholesome for that reason.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
So, that's how you approved the delight.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Because if you can notice,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
if your mind remains unwavered

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
in regard to that subtle,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
neutral feeling,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
doesn't eat anything,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
doesn't require anything,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
doesn't run away from anything.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
The pressure arises,

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
you'll be able to leave it alone.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Because the pleasure of the senses,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
the delight is mental,

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
in regard to the central pleasure.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
But one thing you can recognize

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
is that, no matter how great

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
that central pleasure might be,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
it can never ever be anything more

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
than was defined by your sense organs.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
It can be the greatest taste.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
It's still a taste.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
It's still dependent on the tongue.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
And it can never be more than that.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
It can be the most beautiful sight in the world, again.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
When you forget that it's fully determined

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
by the pair of flesh-y eyes,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
you can have the whole image

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
in the drum and the apprehension,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
the expectation and the realization

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
of this great spectacle.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Because you lost sight of yourself

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
completely taken by it.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
But if you know,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
whatever you see,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
whatever you hear,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
whatever you taste, touch,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
smell,

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
it can never be more than that.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
So, in scene,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
let it just be seen,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
you heard,

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
let it just be heard.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
And so, that's basically what it is.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
It comes down when you recognize that,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
again,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
the entire spectrum

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
of sense objects,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
no matter how great it is,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
let's write up down any direction,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
it's fully determined.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
It cannot kind of step outside

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
even a millimeter

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
out of the sensor of the domain,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
which is a six-cent base,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
which is something that the translation

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
like the fields,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
the senses are like the fields for these things,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
it cannot be more than that ever.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Why?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Why then?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
If I...

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But not knowing it cannot be more than that,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
you delight at the prospect

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
of being more.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And that's mental.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Because they delight,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
can pull you,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
push you,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
make you pursue the senses,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
but in the end,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
all you're going to get is sense

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
and it's object.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
And I agree with it,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
which is why usually people

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
are giving into the desires like,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
oh, was that all?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
The expectations are always high,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
because that's how the mind,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
that's how the delight works.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
And it's nothing unusual about it,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
it's actually quite normal.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
But obviously not knowing that,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
you associate that delight,

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
that is mentioned

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
with this prospect

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
of that sensual desire

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
and fulfillment,

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
feeling to see that

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
that delight takes you

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
in the domain of that sense

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
that has its own scope.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
So eyes cannot experience

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
more anything more than sights.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
ears cannot get you anything more

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
than pleasure of a sound.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
So whether the greatest

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
most refined is still a sound.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
The thing with pleasure

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
is the feeling of perception.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
If you think of eyescream,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
there's a pleasant feeling.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Every time you think of eyescream,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
there's a pleasant feeling

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
every single time.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
There seems to suggest

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
in a mind that there is

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
something there.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Well, the pleasure is real.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
But why is it always connected

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
with a particular perception

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
or image?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Well, it can be random.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
It can be circumstantial,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
because you try to eyescream

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
and you really like it.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Because there is such a thing

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
as a pleasant taste by default.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
But the problem is,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
your question,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
why is this connected?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Assumes that the connection

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
between the two somewhere,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
somewhere inside,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
of the sense objects.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
So if you kind of unravel it all,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
then you will be able to kind of

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
cut those wires,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
and it will not be,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
that's not enough.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
The problem,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
the question you asked

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
is a symptom

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
that you were already affected

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
by the perception of eyescream.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
It's your response

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
to the fact that you don't want

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
this cave

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
from the eyescream.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
You don't know the gratification

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
in that regard.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
You don't recognize the danger,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
and you don't see the escape from it.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Hence, why?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Hence, yes.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Hence, no.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Hence, maybe.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Hence, yes and no.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Any of those acts

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
are just response,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
your ways of responding to the fact

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
that you are already touched by that,

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
but that phenomenon.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
You are taking back.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Because whatever,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
whatever is perceived,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
there is a feeling.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
There is always a feeling.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Feeling perception.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yes.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
So,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
you are trying to do it.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
You are trying to separate them,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
so you are not affected by any more.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
The thing is,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
you have to go the other way.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And by the other way,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
I mean,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
by seeing the perception

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
and feeling are inseparable.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
And the dear eyes on their own

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
means,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
well, you can wander

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
for the rest of your life.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Why is the thought

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
of ice cream always pleasant?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Oh,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
you can just accept that.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
And instead of questioning that,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
try to find a place

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
whereby you don't care.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
And by that,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I mean,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
you don't care

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
not in a sense you can order it,

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
but in a sense,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
perception of pleasant ice cream

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
doesn't bother me anymore.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
It doesn't touch me anymore,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
it doesn't command me anymore.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It doesn't make me do things anymore,

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
it doesn't make me think things anymore.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Cannot overtake me.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
And then,

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
you might wonder,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
why is it pleasant

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
or you might not wonder that?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
But there will be relevant.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Because the only reason you wonder

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
is that now,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
is because you do realize,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
you do recognize the problem

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
of being pulled by your senses.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
So, your question,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
is kind of trying to solve it.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
But if you actually solve it,

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
the proper way,

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
questions become,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
but it doesn't.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Because it's not,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
why is it always pleasant?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You should really ask yourself,

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
why,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
why am I being touched by that?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
By that image.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
By that pleasure.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Why am I being,

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
why is it controlling me?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Why is it better

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
if I'm,

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
well, if I get already,

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
so to speak,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
why is it better

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
if, if I find a way,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
where that pleasure

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
cannot access me?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
You think about that,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
and you will start to recognize the danger.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You will start to recognize the gratification,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
and gratification is what I was speaking about.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Not knowing gratification means

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
confusing your delight,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
with the actual,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
like, central consumption.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
And you recognize that,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
not matter how great the light is,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
gratification remains confined

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
to the domain of a particular sense.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
It's inconceivable for it to be anything more,

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
despite what your delight makes you expect.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
The pleasure of a sight

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
cannot be experienced

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
by anything other than your eyes.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
So you recognize,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
ah, that's the extent of gratification.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
There is no more.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Then you recognize the danger as well.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Expecting more.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Well,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
through that expectation of more,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
you blindly jump back

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
into those domains

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
that are not yours.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
You're going between the eye and sight.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
You're going between the nose

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
and smells, ears,

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
and sounds.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And basically, it's just like running

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
in the middle of a motorway,

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
which is not yours,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
but you don't know it.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
So you just run right in the middle,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
and then something will hit you sooner or later,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
which is what it will compare,

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
giving you the sincerity,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
like, putting your head on a chocolate block,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
where the X falls,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
and it will fall.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It's not yours.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Neither that perception

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
nor that feeling.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
So if you're wondering why,

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
how did that come about?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It means you already took it as mind,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
which that's where it must take it.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Not finding out the answer

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
to those particular questions.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
So you can't help.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
You can't just stop

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
and will the opposite.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
I will not engage in sensuality anymore.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Well, I guess you could do that

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
if you develop genres,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
and then through them,

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
you could think that,

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
and then you could stand

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
for that determination.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
But otherwise,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
you have to recognize

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
gratification,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
the danger.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Why is it dangerous

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
if I give in?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And that will offer

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
the sight of escape.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Ah,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
if I remove the delight,

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
in this,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
nothing to gather the whole world,

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
just in this particular sense,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
in these five senses.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
So you're not chasing after every object,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
you remove the delight in the eye,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
because of which,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
you delight in the sight.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
But if you recognize

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
it's fully confined to your eyes,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
fully confined to your ears,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
you remove the delight in regard to that,

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
and you're like,

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
oh, okay, I'm free from this,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
because no matter how much it arises,

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
it can never sort of,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
well, go behind me

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and kind of scoop me out again

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
as he used to do.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Which is why there,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
there's a similar in the suitters,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
when the Buddha compares,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
well, somebody is free from sensuality,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
it leaves like, like,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
a drop of water on the blade,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
on a sharp blade,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
but it's not cut bad.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Because the five senses, basically,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
entirely, which means

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
your whole world really,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
is not actually yours,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
it belongs to the mind.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
The eyes in your head,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
ears, nose, tongue,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
body, everything.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Anyway, it's easy,

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
it's not just mouth,

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
stasis, and so on.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
It's not yours.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Never would.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
I'm realizing again that,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
it marries the detour,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
well,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
those things are,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
as I've been around,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
undetermined,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
those, those bases.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
What do you mean?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Well, when he,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
you don't have to take service here.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
No, his mind becomes undetermined.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Or each is the undetermined.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
The undetermined.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Those things are just senses.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Well, the determinations have ceased,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
they don't become the undetermined.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
They just cease to act as determinations.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
The determinations of his self.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
To just another way of saying,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
he stops taking it as his.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And they have ceased.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
He let, he leaves them be.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
They have ceased.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Seists to exist as me and mine

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
and determining me and mine.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
So that's what the undetermined is.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Because if there wouldn't be undetermined,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
freedom from the determined

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
would not be possible.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
But because there is the undetermined,

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
freedom from the determined is possible.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So the island doesn't create anyone.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
He just kind of finds a way

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
to step into it.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Because it's already there.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
The undetermined.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
And you step to it

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
through developing full knowledge of it.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
There is absolutely not a way.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Another question was related to this.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
For the wrong question.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
That everything seems to,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
obviously things seem to correspond to each other.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
Like a sight, a sound,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
you know, a sight of a river,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
a sound of a river,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
a touch of a river,

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
all that.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
You know, a correspondence.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
I can feed it.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I mean, I can touch it.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
You can experience it through different senses.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Yeah.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
So they correspond.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
So it's very easy to assume that it's,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
there's that one thing out there.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
The river.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
That's what the river said.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Either things usually appears

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
itself when it's seen twice,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
either in reflection,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
or experience simultaneously

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
through two different senses or more.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Yeah.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Then they conclude,

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
like, it's effortless.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
That's what ignorance means going with the grain.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
That's the grain.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
Or the direction of the stream.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
So you go against it.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
If you were to practice correctly,

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
you're against holding it apart.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Well, you go against it by,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
by full understanding, really.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
There's a method or something.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
By full understanding,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
they each domain,

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
each sense,

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
if that's what your approach is.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
It would be, well, it wouldn't be,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
inducing the sense of self anymore.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
And you said, actually,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
the self disappears.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
When a thing is seen twice in reflection,

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
or experience through two different senses simultaneously,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
it's the self of that thing,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
the self identity of the same thing

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
that you hear and that you see.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Oh, it's the same thing.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
That same is,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
be neither in what you see,

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
nor do what you hear,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I, it's in me.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Oh, it's the same self thing.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Myself is experiencing the same as of these things.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Myself is.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Myself is independent of any other thing

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
that I experience through my sense.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
That's how it kind of goes.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
I'm using these senses to access these things.

34:10.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, their mind.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
So you, you, you will have to be able,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
which is what I, what I mean,

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
when I talk about the,

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
the simultane,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
or the principle of simultaneity

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
and the notes of meditation.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
When you simultaneously hear,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
see something.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
If your mindfulness is established properly,

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
you'll be aware of it as too independent,

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
but simultaneity is the mains.

34:54.000 --> 35:00.000
So they don't actually meet any of the senses ever on their own.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
They will kind of come together in your mind,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
but in their own domains,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
like, well, as I said,

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
in other words,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
they've got to find it indifferent to each other.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
It's just not even a,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
like, there is not even awareness

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
in your hearing,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
in your hearing of your sight.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It's inconceivable.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
Because having awareness of your sight,

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
in your hearing,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
would be, well,

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
your sight appears in your hearing,

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
even as a possibility,

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
even as some,

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
as a different,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
and that seems inconceivable,

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
which doesn't exist.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Which is why you have five consciousnesses

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
in regard to five senses,

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
and then six ones.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
So you have six types of consciousness.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
You know, when I...

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Always.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
When if I see something here,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
something,

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
and also touch and experience...

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Imagine six layers

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
of your experience.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
But...

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Symbol tenures.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
This stuff seems like there is

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
a pain-different attention

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
from this center here.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
From one.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
You give...

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
You still have the assumption

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
of me and myself as the core.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Or your experience.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
When you have to keep developing mindfulness

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
as long as it's necessary,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
and then, well, as I said before,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
when you feel that core,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
you can't start straight

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
onto the senses now.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
The contemplation I'm talking about.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
They can come later.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
It gives us to suffer.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
So now you would have to take up the experience

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
as a whole,

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
and include in that sense of core,

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
that sense of center,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
which is sense of me and I are,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
as a phenomenon,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
as a peripheral phenomenon,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
without making it actual.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
All that we spoke before.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Because by including it,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
bit by bit,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
you become aware of it.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
So then,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
the time will come when you recognize,

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
well, if I'm aware of it,

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
means it appears as a phenomenon,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
which means it will cease as a phenomenon,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
which means it can possibly be me,

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
or anything related to me,

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
in any way.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
It's just a thought.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
Well, just everything is just a thought.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
It's not a sight.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
It's an image.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Oh, yeah, the sense of stuff.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
It's independent of the senses,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
which is how it has that

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
assumed privileged position over then.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
But if you stop and think as we spoke before,

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
this body here,

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
this physical body right here,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
which basically covers up the basis

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
of the senses,

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
the five senses,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
and then the experienced general experience

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
as at all,

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
in my sense of self,

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
or whatever else,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
would that be conceivable

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
in any shape or form

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
if this physical body

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
is to be destroyed

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
next instance?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
He wouldn't.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
So then,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
the privileged position

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
and attitude is slowly being undermined.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
But you have to keep doing it.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And then you can,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
you're not even denying

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
the sense of privilege of you.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
No, you include it.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
So you make sure it gets undermined

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
with the right,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
with the right setup,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
with the right insight,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
with the right reflection.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Which is why,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
in the Anapala Saksata,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I will breathe in like this.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
I will breathe,

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
so you're,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
keep including yourself.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
You keep including yourself

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
in the next breath,

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
in this breath.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Now, do it like this.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
So you include in your very

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
volition,

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
and intention,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
while you're seeing it clearly,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
it even the most,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
the strongest willed thing,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
the most determined thing,

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
well, could have never been yours

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
to begin with it.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Absolutely.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
There simply no room

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
for itself.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
And not just there's no room,

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
it's unnecessary at all.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Which is why there is no room for it.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Because that's a,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
you see the breath is intentional.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Hmm.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
So you,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
you've paid attention to the breath.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
You find that it's really

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
intending.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Well, you can find it,

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
but as long as you include

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
your sense of self,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
in regard to it,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
what happens is people

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
would kind of forget about

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
itself,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
and then it will be our breathing

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
that happens.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Oh, it's this thing breathing me

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
or it's this body really.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
All that is,

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
you can say that,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
it's not inaccurate,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
but the fact that you left

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
a sense of self out of it,

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
means you're not really

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
addressing the problem.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
It's like getting the

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
decent medicine,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
but applying it over a

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
cover-up wound.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
So it doesn't actually reach

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
the point where it's

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
supposed to be active.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
So you keep including

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
your sense of self.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
You keep bringing it forward.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
You're not letting it

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
kind of wiggle out,

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
which is the same,

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
the combination of

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
discraft to you,

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
when you recognize,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
okay, this body is right

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
here, right now,

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
in this situation,

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
in this position,

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
in this shape of form,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
fully material,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
entirely,

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
composed of elements.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
There's absolutely nothing

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
in this body

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
that doesn't pertain

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
to one of the four

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
great elements.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
So it's a hundred percent

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
object,

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
because of which

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
your thinking of what objects are,

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
and that right reflection

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
while you're thinking,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
stands there,

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
because of that

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
random object,

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
like that kettle,

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
like that bottle,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
like that cup.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
So if something happens to it,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
on that material level,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
in which you have no axis,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
at all,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
you realize nothing can

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
remain standing,

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
even the greatest sense of

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
self.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
So establish your mind

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
upon that,

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
and by establishing your mind

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
upon that,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
I mean, in the beginning,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
you have to keep bringing it up,

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
then you fall from

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
that,

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
but then you bring it up,

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
and that thought,

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
that perception,

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
of that relationship,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
stays.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Means, ah,

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
the mind is established

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
to the degree.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Keep it.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
When you lose it,

40:56.000 --> 41:23.000
you have to keep it.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Good one, say that,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
you recognize in that,

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
in this sense of self,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
this sort of derivative,

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
like the different senses,

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
sort of different senses

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
pointing to that one focal point,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
and then recognizing that,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
this, the,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
impermanence of,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
of the sense,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
is a way to get to realize

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
that, that sense of self,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
which is derived from,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
is, um,

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
not solid,

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
not solid.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
It can be,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
for as long as you,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
uh, first acknowledge,

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
that focal point,

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
because it's real,

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
as such,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
and it's there.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Because usually people

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
would result,

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
the contemplation of impermanence

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
of,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
a kind,

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
to obscure,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
or to deny,

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
or to cover up,

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
or to remove,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
that focal point.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Uh, but that's,

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
that's the result.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
If it's there,

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
then,

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
it has a reason.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Whatever has a reason,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
means you want to rise.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
This is no interference

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
with that.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
So,

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
if you were to comprehend

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
impermanence like that,

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
yeah,

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
it will point out that

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
this focal point

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
is not,

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
well,

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
it cannot be taken as me,

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
in mind,

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
because it's fully dependent,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
upon these external,

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
organs,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
they have no control over.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
But that can become very,

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
only after,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
that focal point has been acknowledged,

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
as phenomena,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
because people often get,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
too quick,

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
to say,

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
there's no self.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
There is no self,

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
no self,

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
no self.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
There is self.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
There is focal point.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
It's not yours.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
That's what no self is.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
It's like throwing out the self,

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
throwing out the whole problem,

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
and,

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
yeah,

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
like a scientist,

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
just,

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
just your objective,

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
exactly,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
you're ignoring the problem.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Yeah.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
So, that's what meant

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
before,

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
it's not possible,

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
meditation here today.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Whatever,

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
you include that.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
It's the same principle.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Whatever,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
it has a reason.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Like,

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
trying to exclude it,

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
is a mistake,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
just for that very reason.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Because you have no say

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
over things arising,

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
because if you would,

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
well,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
there would be a sense of self there.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
But they manifest,

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
when they manifest.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
And if you stop,

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
trying to interfere with it,

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
if you recognize that,

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
whatever has a reason,

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
you will see that,

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
for those already reasons,

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
of simple rising,

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
that's why,

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
if you have to cease,

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
not for anything else.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
And that's what impermanence is.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
So, impermanence,

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
actually,

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
is in the rising of things,

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
not like looking,

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
waiting for the destruction

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
to prove that they're impermanent.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Now, they're impermanent

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
because you're experiencing that.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
And to recognize that,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
whatever is arising,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
it's complex,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
it's like an integrated system,

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
and everything integrated

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
has to descend to it.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Well,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
it's not even that,

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
like that's,

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
that's another designation

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
that you will put on top.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
System integrated or simple,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
or whatever.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
The most accurate you can get

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
is saying,

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
it has a reason.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
It is.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
That's it.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
And that's the most accurate phenomenon.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
And you don't have to go for,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
well, you can't actually go further than that.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Because any other,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
more elaborate explanation,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
would be sort of going back down,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
and then provide an explanation for it.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
And an explanation,

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
even if it's the other pleasing one,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
is still an explanation.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
So it has to,

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
it has to be recognized on that general level,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
where it just arises.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And for that very reason,

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
it's impermanent.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
It will have to cease.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
You have no say in its manifestation,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
which is why,

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
it will cease.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
That's it.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
When that's recognized,

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
then everything,

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
whether it's particular or general,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
is seen through that principle.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
And the sense,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
and the very sense of self,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
arises depending on these things.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Yes, they arise.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
So then you recognize,

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
because you recognize principle,

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
then you got to anything,

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
that manifests.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
For that reason,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
it's impermanent.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
You, well,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
yourself manifests.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
And big is,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
general, not specific yet,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
it's manifested as such,

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
thus,

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
it's impermanent.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
It can, with me,

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
it doesn't even occur anymore.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Oh, this is messy.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
It cannot even be assumed.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Even be thought of,

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
a fantasized,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
anymore as myself.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
It's just inconceivable,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
becomes, when that principle is understood,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
which is about the system of Jiram

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
and, oh,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
she lost the dimension of her thought.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah, it's just...

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Well, actually,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
she didn't quite lose it fully.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Back then,

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
but she's clearly recognizing it,

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
because if she lost it,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
she couldn't even remember it,

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
in that sense.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
Like, you can't even bring it back as a memory,

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
because even the preview,

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
the memory,

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
and the past,

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
is seen,

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
because impermanent,

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
which means,

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
yourself ceases to reside,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
even there.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
So, the dimension,

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
it's gone, it's gone.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
So,

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
sort of on it,

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
cannot even remember,

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
well,

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
well,

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
he can recognize what a father is,

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
assuming,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
a father or a father is,

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
but he cannot even conceive that,

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
even as a memory.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
He knows, oh,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I used to do this.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I used to,

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
like,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I used to think that I existed,

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
independent of my senses,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
independent of my aggregates,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
but actually,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
how that,

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
was experienced actually,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
it's inconceivable.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
It cannot arise anymore.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Which is what passed

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
and the future

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
and the present

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
is reflected,

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
with it I knew.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
So, a real key is

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
seeing how,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
this sense of self,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
is dependent on,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
these rising and falling phenomena.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
The standard view,

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
for a protrusion,

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
I think,

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
is that,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
I'm here solid,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
and I'm experiencing all these things,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
and whether they come and go,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
or whether they come and go,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
or whether they come and go,

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
or whether they come and go,

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
or whether they come and go,

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
and that will be what?

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
So, that's what the mind

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
by impermanence.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
And the point is,

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
no, the impermanence

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
has to be personal,

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
which means the impermanence

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
has to pertain to that sense of self.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
So, if you're contemplating something

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
that's coming and going,

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
and you don't feel anything,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
is that's irrelevant?

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
You need to find the impermanence

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
that will concern you,

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
or rather,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
the thought of this thing,

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
disappearing,

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
will concern you.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Which is what I mean,

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
impermanence,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
like,

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
if you, like, seeing a thing,

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
manifest,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and then seeing the destruction of the thing,

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
it's actually another,

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
another arising.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
It's a manifestation,

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
appearance,

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
of a thing being,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
of a particular thing being disintegrated.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
It's not a impermanence.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
It's not,

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
it's actually more arising.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
It's a worldly type of impermanence

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
in terms of things

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
that have changed the shape,

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
or whatever else,

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
but,

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
phenomenologically speaking,

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
it's just another arising experience.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
So,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
you can't actually experience

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
impermanence through your senses.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Any,

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
in any way,

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
you can't even conceal it.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
The true impermanence.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Because if you would,

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
you would need the Buddha

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
to tell you how to find the way out of the self-view.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
You just need to,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
as most of the mystics believe,

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
and, hopefully,

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
access it.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
I threw,

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
threw a vision,

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
threw a mantle of another,

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
and it's impossible.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
So, instead of trying to see,

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
disappearing,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
you recognize that the appearance

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
is the disease,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
because of which,

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
it's gone.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
It will be gone,

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
even if it isn't.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Because if it is,

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
that's another experience

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
that has a reason,

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
because it has a reason,

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
the impermanence is impermanent.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
So,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
that's what you regarded as permanent,

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
is also impermanent,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
and even the impermanent things

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
that you regarded before

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
are even more impermanent.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
So, it's just impermanence,

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
and more impermanence,

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
as opposed to impermanence,

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
and then,

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
too much,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
of permanence.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
Thank you.

49:30.000 --> 49:59.000
Thank you.
