WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
So how was it going? Did you start?

00:05.000 --> 00:13.000
Yeah, actually, actually hosting I want to know is actually many monks, they asked me

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
what's the problem about the understanding of dependent origination.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Actually, I asked a winner where I find you at least it's not necessary for me to know.

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
He thought that maybe I would get confused, but actually simply I don't understand what they're talking about.

00:34.000 --> 00:43.000
I started only the teaching of the non-zero whoever, the timeless creation.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
But I think in Zealand most monks, they don't understand that.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
They think like a dependent origination process.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And that like two lines, three lines, I don't know.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
But what they're talking about, I don't understand.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
So it's very difficult for me to explain what the winner and winner thought.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
So how do you explain to them?

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, I don't think you have to start with a premise that they already have a different view.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I don't want to say never wrong view.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
But yeah, from a real point of view, that's a wrong view.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Wrong view.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
Because they approach a Patitsamapada as an explanation.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I remember Bikubodi.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
He was very, very much sharing the traditional view.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And he would write about it and so on.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
And he would say that no, this is not the core of the Dharma.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
This is more like an encompassing explanation of the entire teaching and the purpose of it.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
So in a way, when you look at it, it's not wrong.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Because any aspect of the Dharma contains the entire Dharma.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
So you can say in relation to anything that it encompasses the entire Dharma.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Because it can't be enough for somebody to become an Arahant.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
However, the Buddha himself said,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Dhamma is Patitsamapada.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Patitsamapada is the Dhamma.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Which means, oh no, it's actually quieter.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
And then the Buddha also referred to Patitsamapada as the reason.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Not knowing that is why people remain bound to some sort.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
So it's actually not an explanation of some ideal and overview.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
It's a very direct insight.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
And the fact is that every Patitsamapada formulation in the sutras

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
starts first by saying, with this, this is, or with the rising of this, this arises.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
And that's already a calica.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
So with the presence of this, this is present.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
It doesn't say, as in the video pointed out, if you adopt a three-life interpretation,

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
it will be with the rising of this and then ceasing, then this arises,

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
then it ceases, then something else arises, then it ceases, then something like that.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
But it doesn't say that.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
It says, with the rising of this, this is.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
So the determination, the reason, the cause, is present simultaneously with that,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
which is being determined.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
And then the Buddha would say himself, with the rising of what, this is,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
and then he would formulate Patitsamapada.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
And Bikobody was aware of that.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Because, you know, his palace is very good.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
But he will refuse to give up his view of three-life interpretation.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
So then he would dismiss this opening statement with this, this is,

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
and say, ah, this is just an abstract principle.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
But actually, even an abstract principle is still a principle.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
So whether it's an abstract or not, it's irrelevant.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
But by saying abstract, you dismiss it.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
But the fact is, it's a principle within which the whole Dharma is contained.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
So if you dismiss that, and then your interpretation of that Patitsamapada

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
goes against the principle, means that's a contradiction.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And that's why it's wrong.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
So he always, oh, just, ah, this is just an abstract principle.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And then puts it aside by labeling it such.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
And then goes on into expounding how the feeling, connection,

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
and this, I even forgot what the traditional interpretation was.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
But yeah, then you had other people say, well, it doesn't pretend.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I think that was K Nyananda Tehra, I think.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
He was saying, doesn't pretend to the three-life, it pretends to one life.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
But again, he took it as an explanation,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
like as a kind of explaining what's happening.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
That's not the Dharma.

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
If you're explaining what's happening, then it loses the aspect of open Ico,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
leading on, that the Buddha talked about.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Because if I provide your explanation, you can say, oh, yes,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
or you can say, oh, no.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
But that's it, it stopped there.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Because it just remains in the level of intellect and the view.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
But if the Buddha describes something that in order for you to understand,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
it leads you on to more understanding.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
That means, ah, that has the nature of the Dharma.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
So you have to bear that in mind when you try to explain to somebody

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
who already has a different view.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
There are very little chances of them understanding it.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Because it is possible for them to understand,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
but it has to come from them.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
In other words, they first have to see that they're wrong

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
and then have to start looking out for what is less wrong

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
in terms of their current view.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And then they might be receiving to hear it.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
But if you're just trying to convince somebody otherwise,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
it's useless. It won't work.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
When I'm working on you, is it, ah, after if we try to understand

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
the teaching of Venomanyana Bhira,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
a timeless relation, and then the past and the future,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
both are not important, is it?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Is it correct?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Is it a traditional interpretation program

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
that passed on the future?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh, is it which means, oh, yeah.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
No, that's it.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, whether it's your past, whether it's your future,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
it's present as such.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Ah, past is present, future is present,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
and the present is present,

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
which is the nature of humanism.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
It's immediacy and reflection.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
It's two modes of existence, so to speak.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
So when you think about your past,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
you think it in your present.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
When you think about your present, you think it in your present.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
When you think about your future, you think it in the present.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
So if you abandon that present,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
in terms of you and this full understanding,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
then neither your past nor future,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
nor that which is right in front of you,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
can pertain to you anymore.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
So in that sense, yeah, absolutely.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
It's not important anymore.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Like, because if the past would be important

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
for the practice of the Dharma,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
well, you couldn't practice the Dharma,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
because you can't change what has happened.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
If the future would be important,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
in terms of how you just have to wait

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
and it will happen by itself,

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
well, then again, well, you just,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
you can never know that directly for yourself.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You can just take it and faith and believe,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
which is actually what most religions rely on.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Just these belief that eventually,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
it will all work out fine for me.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
But like, well, okay, good luck then.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
But what makes you think so?

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
So even if, well, in the cases of people

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
who had horrible past, like Angulimala or other,

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
if they can overturn that,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
and escape that sort of past,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
but he couldn't, certainly,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
he couldn't undo what he'd done.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And he'd done some serious things.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
So you realize, it's in the present,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
which is what I would have said.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It's here and now, visible, here and now.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
You don't have to wait for it,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
and you don't have to remember it.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
It's here and now.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
And in the same sense,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
he called it up and I call it timeless,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
not pertaining to time.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And that's exactly how it doesn't pertain.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
If it was pertaining to time,

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
it would pertain to past.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It would require future.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
But it doesn't.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It's timeless, which means all.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Because if past is present,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
that's it.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
One thing is present, like,

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
output it.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Okay.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Past is in present.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
So that's a timeless relationship.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Present is in the present.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
That's another timeless relationship.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Future is as future in the present.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
That's another timeless relationship.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
When you look at it from the point of view of present,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
even if it's present which you're looking at,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
that's a timeless relationship.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So if you understand that,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
then whatever particularly was that past you were thinking of,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
or whatever particular thoughts were pertaining for the future,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
that's irrelevant.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Because you abandoned present,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
which means you abandoned past, future, and present,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
that were in the present.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
So nothing is left out.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
And in terms of not having to understand,

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
but it's only about that.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, that's true, in a sense,

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
you don't have to understand all of the individual factors

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
the way the Buddha laid them down,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
because they're quite subtle,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
but you need to understand this timeless principle,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
which is why the Buddha called Patitsambhara,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
the Dhamma, Dhamma, Patitsambhara.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
It's the same.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Actually, was it...

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
One who sees the Buddha sees the Dhamma,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
one sees the Dhamma, one sees the Buddha.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah, that's what the Buddha said.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
And then, sorry, Buddha said,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
in terms of Dhamma, Patitsambhara,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
or Buddha, Patitsambhara.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
What are you saying?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Either way, you don't have to understand all of the specific

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
factors of it.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
But you have to understand that principle,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
the big body dismisses is abstract,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
because you understand that all of these things are implied.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
And the fact that the Buddha, quite often,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
described Patitsambhara differently,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
sometimes it would have 12 factors,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
sometimes it would have 15 factors,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
sometimes it would stop,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
if Nama Rupa, Vinyana, Vinyana, Nama Rupa,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
he would omit the whole Vinyana,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Sankara, and then Sankara, Vija.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
He wouldn't talk about it.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
So you realize, oh, it's an exemplification

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
of a principle that can be laid out in different ways,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
but it's still the same principle.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
So if you dismiss the principle,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
you get bogged down in the detail,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
which becomes, basically,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
you have to explain it,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
you have to find the connections,

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
and it becomes linear psychological traditional commentary.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
But if you keep the principle in mind,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
as something that has been understood,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
then you might even not think in terms of

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
the way the Buddha laid it down,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
the whole Patitsambhara, it's your own.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
You understood the principle,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
and three different ignorance, and it's done.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Because again, all of those individual factors,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
if you can refer to them as such,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
it's not one to three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
They're all present simultaneously,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
just on different layers,

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
of present on different layers within the same principle.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
So it is all simultaneous.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
But it doesn't mean that again,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
you can approach it,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
you can think in terms of these 12 factors

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
arising at the same time.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
It depends how you look at it.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
The principle arises at the same time.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
With this, this is.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Now, if you take it further,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
you can start defining the same principle,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
further, and further, and further.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
And that's how those factors were defined.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
But it's not more than that.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And certainly, it's not about

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
drawing linear connection between the factors

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
and trying to present a chart

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
that will really encompass it all.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
Well, that is definitely pointless.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
And won't bring any,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
well, any timeless understanding.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
And I think the Unreal also mentioned

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
in one of the letters,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
when somebody asked him,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
well, this is the first time that they heard

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
that somebody defines

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
but did somebody learn that?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
And so on.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
They were not disagreeing with him,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
but they were just curious,

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
how is that?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Well, he said, well, you know,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
you might have another sort of partner

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
who wouldn't necessarily think in those terms.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Because if he didn't approach it

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
through that way in terms of understanding,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
he won't be able to recognize that,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
but what he would recognize,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
what he will know is the principle

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
with this, this is.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
And that principle is contained

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
in that representative insight

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
of a sort of partner,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
which is whatever has the nature of rising

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
for every reason,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
has the nature of ceasing

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
because it has a reason.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So permanence is implied

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
so that's how the being gets undone.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
So again, it's not that, you know,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
for a sort of partner,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
for another hand, those 12 factors

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
just get kind of emerged,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
like a glowing writing in the wall

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
and it's the principle that can be taken

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
as far as necessary.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Obviously, the Buddha being the foremost

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
of all of the Buddhas

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
in explaining the Dharma,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
he really explained to the last

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
every possible detail,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
which is why

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
the previous Buddha, when he explained

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
the Petit Sampada, he actually didn't go further

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
than Nama Rupa Vinanda.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Vinanda Nama Rupa.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And again, if you end up,

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
if you end the description

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
of the principle,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
you end with mutual dependence

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
of two things.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And two things can be mutually dependent

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
only if they're simultaneously present.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
If two sticks

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
hold each other,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
which is that the similissari

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
put the gate for Nama Rupa,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
determining Vinyana, Vinyana,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
determining Nama Rupa,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
they have to be up simultaneously.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
They have to be down

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
and then lift the other one.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
There is no dependence there.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
So the entire relationship

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
which have a factor

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
of Petit Sampada,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
you pick up, is

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
within that nature,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
shares that nature.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Simultaneous dependence.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Well, this consciousness

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
is actually very important to anything.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Actually, before

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
many Christian people, they give

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
something like the desire.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Actually,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
after actually knowing

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
the teaching of Vinyana,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
and then, actually,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
after meditating,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
actually come to see, actually, this

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
consciousness is just like

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
supporting the

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
contact to arise.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Well, it's one of the aggregates.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
So if somebody is after

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
the bond of understanding,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
all of the aggregates need to be

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
understood.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Obviously, consciousness

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
is that which doesn't appear

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
like you can't see consciousness

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
directly as an object.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
As you can see a cup

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
or a glance, or a door, or a car.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It just doesn't arise there.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Which is why

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
most often consciousness is

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
that with people regardless

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
of one way or the other.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
But the fact that there is

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
something, even if you don't know

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
what it is, but

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
that there is a designation

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
that you can call consciousness,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
you can see, and you can even

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
describe it, means there is something

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
in your experience that stands

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
for that.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
So, full understanding of that

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
would mean full understanding

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
of consciousness.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
In the same way, you would understand

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
objects of your senses.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Because it precedes them.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
It's because your conscious

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
objects of your senses can arise.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
If you are not conscious,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
eyes won't be seen.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
It is won't be hearing.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
So it's a

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
negative phenomenon.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And that's why

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
when I told you before,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
it's very important to

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
recognize this actual

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and peripheral,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
we spoke, because

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
consciousness is the ultimate

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
peripheral.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
It's that peripheral that never

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
appears, but it's there.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
And the most

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
precisely you can define,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
you would be in the very

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
ambiguous terms,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
such as, it's the presence,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
presence of things.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
The fact that things are

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
present means consciousness is there.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Obviously, people can now

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
overdo that,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
and then end up

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
mystifying consciousness,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
as the example you gave Christians,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
or new age,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
whatever, religion, really,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
including Buddhism,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
when they start over.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
It's the ultimate consciousness.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It's the pure consciousness.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
That consciousness is this consciousness.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You overmystify that presence,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
but if there is nothing present,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
you can't have the presence.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
You need to have a thing

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
in order for it to appear.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
So, that's why consciousness is

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
not independent.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
It requires Nama Rupa.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
If there isn't,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
consciousness could not

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
be discerned.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So, as much as

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
consciousness determines that

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
which appears,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
allows it to appear

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
to the same extent that which has appeared,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
defines consciousness.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Otherwise, it wouldn't be there.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Consciousness is just

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
a six kind.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
In particular,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
you don't have to think of them

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
at the same time,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
because they get complicated,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
but you can take a sense.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Eyes are conscious.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Eyes are conscious.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That's the thing.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Most of people automatically assume

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
matter is out there,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
consciousness is in here.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
But actually matter

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
and consciousness

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
are on the same level

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
out there.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
And their relationship

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
is known as Nama Rupa.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
And that can have the internal aspect

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
and external aspect.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
So actually, consciousness

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
is out there with the things.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Which is why

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
it can never be yourself.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
For as long as you think

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
it's in here,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
you will be taking it as me.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
But if you see it out there,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
in that material world,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
then you realize,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
well, I cannot have that

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
nothing more than I could

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
have matter to be mine.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
And that's

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
what Yonero is talking about

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
instead of different terms.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
When he was saying that Rupa

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
and Vinyana,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
they were

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
well superimposed

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
or just like two different things

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
but they come together.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
They don't mix.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
I mean, they just get associated.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
The result of that

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
is Nama Rupa.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
It's the whole world

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
that you know that you can never know

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
your past, your future.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
It's all within Nama Rupa.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Within the conscious matter.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Because if your consciousness is truly

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
in you, it would be independent from the body.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
But when that material body

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
gets disintegrated,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
consciousness goes.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
It cannot stay.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
You mean that the sense of self.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Sense of self.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
The consciousness is in the body,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
you know?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
No.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Why would it be?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
With the consciousness,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
this body consciousness is associated

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
with the body.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
The reason you can look in or out

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
or in and out or wherever you want

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
is because you are already conscious.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So the sense of space

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
the direction where you look

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
is possible only because

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
the body is already conscious.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
The consciousness, the five aggregates

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
are already there.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
So it's secondary to that.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
If it's secondary means

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
you can't use it then to find

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
its origin.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Not the origin.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And if you, you know,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
you look in the distance and you see

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
the tree really, really far out.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, your consciousness is out there.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Consciousness is out there.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I mean the...

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Doesn't mean it's in that matter.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Means it's associated with that matter.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
No matter how far it is.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Whether it's in your thoughts or through your senses.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
It's actually external.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
For other hand,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
all of the aggregates become external.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Externally.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
External means you mean

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
that they're not serve in the...

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Well, yes, for other hand, yes.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
External means not serve.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And the Buddha did say that

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
for somebody completely free from ignorance,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
what is left is

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
this conscious body

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
and all

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
whatever name and form externally.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
That's what's left.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
So the body

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
that is associated with the consciousness

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
or consciousness associated with the body

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
is just like

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
two completely different things

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
that kind of come and stop together

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
which is the birth.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
But then

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
when one of them goes

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
the other one cannot remain standing.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
But it's not that consciousness enters

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
in the body.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Because any notion of space

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
is the fact that you're conscious.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So consciousness cannot be

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
in its own result.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
For other hand,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
does any idea appear that

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
as my body, but the thought itself

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
is not this.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Well, even when he thinks my

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
eye, I am or I am this

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
or this is my carp order,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
that doesn't imply

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
the emotional significance

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
of me and sense of self.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
In other words, I can say that's my cup

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
but if somebody comes and steal it

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I won't suffer an account of it.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
But as a designation of speech

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
you can, you know, in the Buddha said that.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Well, the target that says I am

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
but it doesn't mean that he really thinks he is.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
He's just the figure of speech

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
becomes for him.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Where a practitioner, when he says

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I am for him, that is his sense of self.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
So as a designation, it's valid.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
You have to designate it somehow.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
He's just a misunderstanding

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
that goes with it.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
That's removed.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
In case of an other hand.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
You thought itself was different?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Actually, different, you know, I think?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Well, differently as much as there is no

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
greedy version of the illusion ever.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Again, to arise.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Well, they cannot appear.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Cannot.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
No. So, he's not just temporarily free from

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
greedy version of the illusion.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
An other hand, he's free from

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
a possibility of those things arising.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Which is why he's another hand.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
There might be pleasing thoughts,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
displeasing thoughts, neutral thoughts.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
But pleasing thoughts won't be inducing

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
any more lust.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Displeasing thoughts won't be inducing any anger.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
And neutral thoughts won't be inducing any delusion.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Hmm.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Displeasing.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
How it happens in the mind of our hunter?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Displeasing.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Displeasingness.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Oh, this is disagreeable.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
It's a feeling.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Well, I know, because if you could see the difference,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
you would be on a way to become an hunter.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
How can something be displeasing

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
without implying

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
ill will or aversion?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Hmm.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
If you can see that, then, oh, keep doing it.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And then you learn how to be displeased

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
without being angry.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Hmm. Which means you free yourself from anger.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Hmm.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
But

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
you can't, like, feeling

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
as feeling for a protugina

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
is not the same...

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Well, it's not the same

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
as arrogance feeling

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
as an aggregate.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
So then, that's why,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
when the Buddha would talk,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
he would make a categorical difference.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
He would say, no feeling.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
In case of an argument,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
because there's no protugina feeling.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
No.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
But that doesn't mean that he's just dead.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Because, again, that's another protugina's reference, then.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Hmm.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
And none of the protugina's references

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
can apply to another hunt.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Which is why, again, we have said,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
if protugina would understand

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
what a state of our hunt is,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
he would be on the way to become one.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Hmm.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
So it's not that you can get a clear idea

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
and still be a protugina.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Clear idea frees you from the state of protugina.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Hmm.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Hmm.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
In the case of an argument,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
it's different.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Well, it's in between.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So, the overall picture,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
the fundamental principle,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
that's all understood,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
that's all set.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
But they have to keep repeating it.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Until all the habits,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
they were based on unwholesome,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
greedy version delusion,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
disappear,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
and then they can stop.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
So, if you're trying to have, like, a clear definition,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
you can't.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
It's just,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
well, the most precise you can get

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
is what Buddha himself used

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
to describe the four different

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
stages of enlightenment.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
But in the beginning,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
they weren't.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
He didn't. They didn't exist.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
That doesn't mean the dhamma didn't exist

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
or the stages didn't exist.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
It was basically somebody who understood the dhamma

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
and somebody who fully developed it

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
and now went beyond and is free.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
And then there was that whole,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
whole chapter in Samyutani Kavan,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
whenever somebody would die,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
renderable under,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
would go to the Buddha and ask him,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
oh, such and such person died.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
What's their destination?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
And then we say,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
oh, he will return one more time,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
or he won't return it all.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Oh, he will be reborn in this heaven.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
He will be reborn.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
But it was just becoming all the time.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
He said, well, if,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
he will ask me about the river,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
it's just going to be a real bother for me.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
So why don't I tell you something,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
that you can use as a criteria

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
to decide for yourself

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
where most likely that person will be reborn?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
So Sotabana,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
at most, will have seven rivers.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
He might have less.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
So it's not.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Sotabati, seven,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
or something like that.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
It's a guideline.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
It's like a little

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
stopping points

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
of one, actually,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
just one process,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
which is developing,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
understanding the Dharma,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
and fully developing that understanding.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
So then he would say,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
he's suffering and we would return one more time.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And then he wouldn't return.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
And then he would give that in relation to the ten fetters.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Because,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
by dwelling on those ten fetters,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
by contemplating them,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
you will, you can fully understand them.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
And when you fully understand them,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
you understand that you understood.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
So it's not like, oh,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
however understood means, oh, there is doubt there.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
It means you haven't understand them enough.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
So sometimes people might,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
when they get,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
when they're overestimate themselves,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
or are just plain deluded,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
they refuse to doubt.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
And they think that's the way to go beyond the doubt.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
When they just do not doubt.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
If somebody doubts, they just ignore that.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
If somebody doesn't know,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I think no, no, I refuse to accept that.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
But that's just ridiculous.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Doesn't, doesn't work like that.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
So you should doubt all the time.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
Because doubt keeps turning things around.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
And then,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
it can make you, it can enable you

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
to develop understanding

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
that will then be truly impenetrable

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
to your full-on acts of doubt.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Because if you never doubt,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
you don't know if you'll be on the doubt.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
If you doubt all the time

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
and learn how to,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
while doubting, go beyond that doubt,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
ah, then you can truly know for yourself

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
and you cannot doubt that.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Because you're doubting,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
and it makes no difference.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Lord Buddha, you encouraged people to

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
question some doubts.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Whenever for you,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
you're actually not only one.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Several times tower me that

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Lord Buddha actually said

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
that we must believe what he said.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
And not,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
you don't actually encourage people

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
to question beliefs.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
It's not correct.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
No, it's not correct.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Oh, yeah, he said, don't take my word for it.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
He said that himself.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Don't just believe what I say.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
It's great for you if you have such faith.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
But you don't have to.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
No, you should examine it

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
and see why is it so.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
And then your faith will be unshakable.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Because you understood it.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Yeah.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Quite the opposite, quite the opposite.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Because often, yes, you would have, no, no, just don't doubt.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Just do what I said. Stop asking.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
No, no, he was, like, he would even encourage monks

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
to keep interrogating each other all the time.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Because that's how you progress.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
That's how you develop understanding.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Obviously, sometimes people can take that,

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
oh, well, the Buddha encourages us to doubt and to question.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
And then you state that for just being argumentative.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
You know, when somebody just wants to argue

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
over any little point.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
And then, well, the Buddha won't know.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
He didn't say that. He said, if you have a genuine interest,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
you have to keep overturning things.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
And like digging, digging, and digging, and digging,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
while you're through conversation with others

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
all inside of your mind.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Because that's how understanding can come.

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
But, yes, sometimes people just use that as an excuse

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
to indulge their habits of arguments

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
or just enjoying the debate or things like that.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
And he didn't encourage that.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
He didn't encourage debates for the sake of debate.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
I think in the history, this is actually

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I really wanted to know it.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
I think there are a few other things that share

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
even from that, even for the Buddha's channel, you can see

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
the career, the record is perfect.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
I've said, there are so many cases that in sutra

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I've mentioned that there are some areas

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
that are like immoral or whatever.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
But I actually want to understand this.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Some people thought he was angry.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
But there is no anger in his mind.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Yeah.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
How much does it have?

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Because I heard it's a very harsh speech.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Yeah, that was your case.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
Well, the first thing is, it's possible.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
But it's very unlikely.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
So when you get cases like that,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
there are a few cases in the sutras,

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
or even Vanderbilt Chana and Sariput,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
the one who committed suicide,

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
the Buddha thought that he wasn't an other hand.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
And Buddha said, well, why do you say that?

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Because he was associating with bad families,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
with families of bad reputation.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
He was very close with them.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
So they all thought, bad of him.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
But they said, no, he wasn't an other hand.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
So the external measure, it's not necessarily a measure.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
And the putusions criteria cannot encompass an other hand.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
And if they do, it's accidentally.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
They don't know why.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
But nevertheless, from, I think, probably for 80 or 90%

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
of people, 100 means there won't be any of those things left.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I think there is some, well, like in the case of an angry,

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
well, seemingly angry aren't.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
The Buddha said, well, the reason why his speech is still like that,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
is for 500 lifetimes.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
500 times, he was reborn and lived, I don't know, a long time.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
So let's just say he lived 80 years each time.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
It's like, oh, 4,000?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
4,000.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
But it's 4,000, 4,000 years.

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
He was reborn in the Brahmin family.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
And they were always higher than the others.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
They would always speak convincingly to the others.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
So the habit just got so established that even he became an other hand.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
He's actually just calculating the same form of speech.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
The feeling itself is different for their hands.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
There's no angry.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
I was thinking there was something kind of anger that taught itself

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
already disowned.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
Well, again, the only way you can look at it is through your own.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
Like, window or experience, you can't really.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And you can actually relate to that.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
I'm sure everyone at some point experienced when some person

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
told you something that you really believed it was like that.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
And then you realized it was completely different.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
While they were saying this, they meant something completely different.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And you didn't know that.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
You couldn't know that.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
So in the same sense, when you come across somebody who speaks angrily,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
you end up assuming he's angry.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
But then you can find a later on that actually, no, he wasn't.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
He just says, have it.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Or if you go again, like, you know,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I've been in Thailand, Sri Lanka.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
So you see the different cultures, different things people do.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
And sometimes, some things people do in Thailand

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
consider very rude in Europe.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
And vice versa, something we do in Europe.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
So you know that there can be a different significance

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
of the identical external output.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
So you can do something exactly the same in one country.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Do exactly the same in another country.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
It can be completely different.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Or even coming from the same person.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Sometimes you can say something exactly the same.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
And be angry about it.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Sometimes you can say something exactly the same.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
And not be angry about it.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
So anger is indifferent to that.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Often it's a manifestation of anger.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I act of both the speech of mind.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
But if there is no anger, there is still both the speech of mind.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
And they will still be doing things.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
And that's why it's a manifestation of anger.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Hmm.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
For areas, is it correct that I was thinking that

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Aria means totally, I think,

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
become indifferent to any feeling or thought.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Or is it?

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
Actually, that's why I was thinking that some of

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
these behavioral, not the arhanda, are areas.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
I basically couldn't understand because

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
any kind of an Angkor Santhor,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
in the case of Aria, not the arhanda.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
Just an Aria means totally indifferent to such a feeling of thought.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Well, no.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Totally different would be an arhanda.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Different.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Totally indifferent would be an arhanda.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Totally indifferent means the economy.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
There would be fully developed to pay car.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That's totally indifferent.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
40,000, by the way.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
So, in case of an Aria,

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
again, it depends on how far his faculties developed.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Like, you know, when...

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Well, there was that sutra when the Buddha

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
was staying in that forest.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
And on the other side of that forest,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
it was a group of young men and women.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
They paid those courtesans to come with them in the forest.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
They were all getting loose and central.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
And then they all fell asleep after.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
And one of them woke up,

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
one of the courtesans woke up and stole all of their gold money.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
And ran away.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
When they realized they start chasing them.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
So, imagine their state of mind

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
after this pleasure,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
central evening,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
and then full of anger over like,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
oh, we've been deceived and so on,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
they were chasing to kill her most likely.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
And then they accidentally,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
as they were chasing,

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
they came across the Buddha.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
They didn't even know he was the Buddha.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And so, he told them,

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
well, why don't you sit down

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
and I can teach you something instead.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
They will be more beneficial to you than finding that gold.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
So, you know,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I'm sure some of them come down,

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
but still,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I'm pretty sure they're still angry.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
And then upset.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Yet, right there and then,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
he calmed them down.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
He first he talked about the significance of virtue,

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
why it's good to develop in generosity.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
They understood that because everybody can understand that.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
And there was a sufficient basis for them to then

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
develop right view,

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
because then he spoke about the Dharma

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
and they understood exactly what he meant.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
And they all became sort of honest.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
So, you realize,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
oh, okay,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
it's not that hard then.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
If somebody can have their mind full of lust

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
and then aversion and anger,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
and then they could come down

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
and then they could see the nature of things.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
But that doesn't oblige them to follow it.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
So, they might have well understood it,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
but I think it comes from their previous rights.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I mean, they have many practices.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Well, I think what comes from previous life

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
is the fact that you're born as human

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
with all of your faculties intact.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Nothing else excuses somebody

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
for not understanding Dharma

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
or understanding it.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
In other words,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
those who make the effort will understand

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
those who don't, they won't.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
But yeah, there is something's previous life,

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
but I think people put too much emphasis in that

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
as a way of absorbing

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
themself from responsibility.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Oh, well, no.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
If you're a born, intelligent,

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
normal, human being who can think normally,

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
discern normally,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
there is no excuse for not understanding Dharma.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
They're just seasoned.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Everything is there.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
So, if you don't understand it,

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
because you haven't been making the right effort.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
And it's kind of blunt,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
but that's exactly how it is.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
So,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
when you had those,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
like when sometimes the householders

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
would come and see the Buddha

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
or even come to complain about something,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
or criticize you,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
and then he would come and down,

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
talk about them,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
and then they would understand them,

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
and become sort of honest.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
And sometimes they would say,

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
oh, from now on,

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
I'm going to become a monk,

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
and practice this.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
But sometimes they would,

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
and sometimes they would say,

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
well, thank you, Lord.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
We are very busy.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
We have to go back home,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
we have lots of things to attend to.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
As sort of honest,

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
like his father,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
when his father came and complained about

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
because he ordained him,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
he came only tears and upset.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Because, well, first you went,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
now you took my only grandson.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
But then the Buddha came down,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
made him a sort of money

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
through explaining the dharma,

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
and they all,

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
thank you very much,

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
I have to go now, I'm busy.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
So, they don't necessarily always want to practice it,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
especially because, oh,

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
this understanding is already quite an accomplishment,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
and they get content in that,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
which means that three quarters

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
of their mind still needs to be

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
dealt with,

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
but they don't.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
They're still one quarter.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
So, the spirit,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
it's not that clear,

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
clear cut,

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
but in the nutshell,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
then the student of one needs to be done,

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
but they don't necessarily want to do it right now.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
They will eventually,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
they can't ignore it for too long,

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
which is why,

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
so the one is that,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
at most, seven beavers,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
no more than that.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
So, that, and even, even that,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
the whole, as I said before,

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
the whole,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
the vision of Suttapana,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Saka Gamyal Gamyal Gamyal Gamy,

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
sometimes the Buddha

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
would omit Saka the Gamy,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
even he would just say,

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Suttapana,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
and then he would start talking about Anagami,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
and then he would talk about Anagami,

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
and as I said,

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
in the beginning,

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
they were not.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
He was just fully enlightened,

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
or not fully enlightened.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
So, it's a guideline.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
It's a guideline,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I don't know, basically,

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
of understanding the Dharma.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
And he was also a guideline,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
given to people to reassure them,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
just reason they came again,

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
across that sort of,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Mahanam and the household there,

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
who was,

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
he wasn't clear in the suitors,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
whether he was Saka the Gamyal Suttapana,

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
because he was never said,

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
he was always said that he's a noble disciple,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
who still lives the household life.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
And,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
and there was this, this Suttapana,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
and he says,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
so he knew that he was a,

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
well, he knew that he was a noble disciple,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
but it was before the Buddha,

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
defined all of these seven reverts,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
so he came to the Buddha one night,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
one evening, and he said,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
oh, how is it Lord that,

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
like, you know,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I'm the one who understood the Dharma,

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
and I know that I understood it,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
and so on.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
But on some occasions,

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
when I walk on the,

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
like now,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
when I come to see the Lord in the evening,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
and it's getting dark,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
and if I come across,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
a stray dog,

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
a stray man,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
or a stray elephant,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
or some form of danger,

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
he forgets about all the Dharma he understood,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
and, you know, he gets filled with fear,

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
and then he says,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
what if I were to die

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
at that moment,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
on account of that stray dog,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
stray elephant or stray man,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
what would my destination be?

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
So he was concerned,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
that if he dies in that state of mind,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
although he knew that he was a noble disciple,

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
he was concerned,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
and if he dies in that state of mind,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
his destination might be unfortunate,

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
because,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
unless you have a supernatural body,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
you can't see those things.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
And the Buddha said,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
oh, you have absolutely nothing to fear.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
The one who understood the Dharma,

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
who developed that kind of noble virtue,

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
noble understanding,

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
nobody's,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
even if your mind is overwhelmed with fear,

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
when you die,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
it still won't make a difference

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
to your destination.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
But the interesting bit, to me,

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
that is that,

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
oh, there was a sotapanarsaka,

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
the Rami,

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
who wasn't sure about certain things.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
He was sure about the nature of the Dharma,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
but he doesn't know

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
how far he's understanding of the Dharma,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
the real understanding of the Dharma,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
how far he takes him,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and for that,

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
the Buddha would often talk,

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
like,

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
I will see the mountain,

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Himalayas,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
and then he would pick up seven grains of sand.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
And he said,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
the size of that mountain

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
is the size of suffering

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
that sotapana has abandoned,

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
and all he has left,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
is the amount of this,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
seven grains of sand.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
So that's how much he has destroyed.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
So it's quite an accomplishment,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
even to get that understanding.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
And that's why he will give those encirigments

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
of that kind,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
but sotapana doesn't see that.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
He sees the Dharma,

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
he sees the time of principle,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
he sees the four noble truths,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
he sees the way out of suffering,

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
and actually that in itself,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
is more than enough.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
All of this comes in as an extra.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Over the other hand,

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
they don't remember their previous,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
not over, not only some.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Sorry, Buddha couldn't remember,

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
I knew it.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
He said,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
the foremost,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
after the Buddha,

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
in teaching the Dharma,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
in expanding every angle,

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
and approach,

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
just like,

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
you know,

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
people couldn't see the difference

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
whether he would speak of the Buddha,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
because he understood all of it,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
but he said he couldn't see

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
even a little goblin.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Like nothing,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
he couldn't see any of that.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Neither supernatural,

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
nothing,

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
he was just non-existent for him,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
which is why it's irrelevant,

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
whether you see it or not.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
It makes no difference.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Some people can,

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
but...

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I was thinking that remembering the past,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
it's very important to understand the role of karma.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
It's not necessary.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
No, no, no.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
If karma is truly

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
determined by your past,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
you're stuck.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
You can't do anything about it.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
If Angoli Mala's karma was in his past,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
he couldn't have not overcome it,

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
because he couldn't bring those people back to life.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Action is intention,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
and intention is very present thing,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
and things you do are very present,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
and that's where you abandon it.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
And when you abandon your...

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
Through, like, a full understanding,

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
through abandoning ignorance,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
when you abandon your action by both this speech and mind,

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
nothing you have done,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
nothing you would have done

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
can pertain to you anymore.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
In the same sense,

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
when you abandon the nature of present,

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
what's present,

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
you abandon past that can be present,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
you abandon future that can be present,

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
and you abandon present,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
that's present.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
There are some people

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
they are always doing wrong things,

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
but it's quite important

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
to understand karma.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Well, no, it's not action, no.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
I think it's important for them to understand Vipaka.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Because karma,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I think the whole notion

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
you've got overly mystified now,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
it almost becomes like this energy

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
of righteousness,

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
like, well, that's your karma,

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
you deserve it,

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
or things like that,

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
but karma means action.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
Feeling this carpet water is a form of karma.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Whole sum,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
around whole sum,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
people might want to dwell on Vipaka

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
on the results,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
on that karma.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
And that's something

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
that can cause sense awareness,

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
because if you start thinking,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
well, if I misbehaved,

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
if I do these things,

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I could end up experiencing

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
very bad results,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
and then that can inspire them

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
to be more whole sum

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
and do less evil

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
or whatever they've been doing before.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
But in terms of thinking about karma,

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
and understanding the workings of the karma,

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
or something like that,

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
the Buddha said

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
that it can only bring madness

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
or destruction.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Unless you're a Buddha,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
who can then fully understand

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
the workings of the karma,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
if he directs his mind towards it,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
if somebody else tries,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
you just end up distracting yourself

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
about pointless things,

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
or go mad on account

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
of really trying to understand

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
something that you cannot possibly comprehend.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Which, enough,

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
it just says it in a different way,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
it's irrelevant

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
in terms of understanding.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
Like you understand the nature of action,

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
you abandon it,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
but you don't understand,

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
why when you've done something

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
in the past now,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
that was the result of this,

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
that's a complete

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
like looking elsewhere

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
in a wrong direction.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
How Buddha could teach

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
the importance to be a Burgess,

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
the Burgess,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
how would he teach it?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Well, he would teach that

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
because of the,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
he would say about the Vipaka,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
he would say about the results.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
And then again,

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
even that,

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
he said,

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
well, don't believe what I say,

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
but reflect for yourself.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
And I think I've already said before,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
when you told those people,

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
okay,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
it's a fact that you don't know

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
whether there is an ex-life or not.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
It's a matter of belief,

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
you don't want to take it or you want to know.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
But actually,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
even then,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
you can use your intelligence.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
So even puttuja,

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
I can understand that,

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
whereby you can kick in just,

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
basically,

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
sit and think,

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
okay, I don't know

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
that there is a future life,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
or not.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
If I misbehave here,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
right now, in this life,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
well, I'll get in trouble

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
from people,

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
that's a fact,

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
I'll be put in jail,

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
people will hate me,

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
if I get away with it,

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
people will trust me,

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
I have to be on the run,

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
I have to keep looking

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
around all the time,

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
I'll live in fear,

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
or whatever,

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
so that's all unhoveled,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
some states.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
And then,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
if there is a future life,

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
then he'll experience

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
even worse rebirth

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
when a count of bad actions.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
If there isn't no future life,

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
okay, he won't experience

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
any bad rebirth,

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
but he'll still suffer

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
in this life when a count

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
of his bad actions.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Now, the other person

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
who thinks,

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
well,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
if I do good in this life,

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
well, people will praise me,

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
which is nice,

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
people will be helpful to me,

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
which is nice,

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
people will want to

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
repay my kindness,

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
which is nice,

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
people will trust me,

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
which is nice.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
And then,

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
if there is no future life,

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
well, so big,

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
at least,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I live a good life here.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
If there is a future life,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
then I'll also get a better

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
rebirth,

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
so I'll win on both fronts,

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
and if I misbehave,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I'll lose on both fronts.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
So even then,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
it doesn't have to be a matter

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
of belief anymore.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
There is a clear understanding,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
almost a practical,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
and oh,

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
so it's actually,

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
that's why this is awesome.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
That's why that's awesome.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
That's why it's better to behave,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
than to misbehave.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
And then,

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
they have no knowledge

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
of previous lives,

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
no knowledge of

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
future Vipaka,

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
waiting for them,

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
is just intelligence,

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
human intelligence,

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
basic discerning.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
You just stop and think,

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
for a second,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and it becomes apparent.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Because there's no denying

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
that if you do unwholesome things,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
people will complain.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
If you meet someone,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
if you can't stop doing wrongdoing,

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
how you can...

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Some people,

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
there's a problem in front of me,

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
keep killing the snakes,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
and all of those things,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
and it's impossible for them to stop.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
They say,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
it's impossible.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
How do you...

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
No, they're lying to themselves.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
If they say it's impossible,

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
what that means,

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
doesn't mean it's impossible,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
it means they can't be bothered

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
to try to stop.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
So they'll keep doing it.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
But you can't stop it,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
if they don't want to stop it.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Unless you're stronger than them,

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
and twist their arm,

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
and restrain them

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
until the snake escapes.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
You can't do it.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
So...

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
So you never give in otherwise?

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Well, the reason,

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
I mean, you could...

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Again,

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
if you can...

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
If you try to convince people too hard,

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
they will start

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
ignoring you even harder.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
So unless the person who just

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
done something silly,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
unwholesome in front of you,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
is not willing to listen to you.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
No amount of things you say,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
and you'll be wasting your words then.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
They won't take any heed.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
If they come and...

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Oh, yeah, okay, well,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
like if they really want to understand it,

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
then it's a different matter.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Matter.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
And then you can tell them

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
just what I told you now.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Like,

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
even if you don't know

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
whether you're bad action,

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
we'll bring the...

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
the future misery in terms of the future rebirth.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Well, you can still know for sure

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
that in this life,

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
it will.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
And also,

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
the fact is that you don't know

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
whether you're going to be reborn or not.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Surely you should play it safe.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
As if you are going to be reborn.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
So just in case,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
I'll behave here.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I'll be praised here on my behavior.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
And if there is a future rebirth,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
then I'll be safe.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
So it's almost like a precaution.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Just in case I'll behave.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
If I know for sure that there is no life,

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
this is going to live here,

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
I'll do whatever I like,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
but you cannot know that for sure.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
And that's something you can know.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
You can know for sure

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
that you don't know these things for sure

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
and you can never will,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
which is why it's better to

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
use wisdom and say,

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
well, why would I like a risk?

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Especially when

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
we're not risking our behaving properly,

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
we'll only respect in this life

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
and protect in the future life

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
if there is one.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
It's a winner in every respect.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
But people usually say,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
well, I don't know that there is a rebirth.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Well, yeah.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
But you don't know that there isn't a rebirth,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
but they don't think that far.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
They just think the first part

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
because that means,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
oh, well, I don't believe that

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I can do what I want here.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
But actually,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
even if you don't believe or believe,

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
if you stop and think,

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
it would become apparent

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
why you shouldn't be doing those things.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
But again,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
unless a person is willing to hear that,

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
everyone listen to you.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
They don't want this to anybody.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
You know,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
a lot of people don't really get quite.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Well, yeah,

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
sometimes people come and ask,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
ask him the wrong question

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
or they would formulate the question wrongly.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
She said that.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
Sometimes the target that

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
meets this person

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
and the target that has inclination

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
to teach him.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
But then this misguided person

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
formulates his question wrongly

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
and then the target that goes silent.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
And that's what I teach him then.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
Ah, yeah.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Because they came from a wrong place.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Because whatever he says,

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
they'll take it wrongly.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Or sometimes they come with the question

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
and ask him,

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
like when they ask him,

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
oh, must they go down?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Is there a self?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
So if you say,

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
yes, there is,

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
but there isn't that person

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
who will take,

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
that's not self.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
A self.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Because you already implied in his question,

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
that there is a self.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
So which one is it?

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
So the Buddha was quiet.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
He said,

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
well, does that mean there isn't?

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Well, there isn't.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
There isn't.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Or both.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
No, yeah.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
And he was just quiet.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
And then this person left.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
And I asked him,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
why didn't you answer?

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
He said, well,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
because whatever I would have said,

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
he would have misunderstood.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Why?

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Because he was coming

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
with a completely wrong attitude.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
So he wasn't willing to understand.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Then I think on a later occasion,

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
when I'm in the told him,

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
you should answer like this.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
Don't answer like that.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
And then he asked rightly,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
that the target of the told him

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
and then he understood.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Because that's a big surprise.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
We thought that,

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
when I was going up on you,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
actually, he first told me

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
that there is no self.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
He's wrong.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
There is no self.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Before, always,

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
I heard that,

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
the old monks,

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
they teach there is no self.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
There is no self.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
It's a denial.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
He is quiet.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
I have seen,

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
and didn't notice my mistake.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
And he told me,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
that in the case of Potuchana,

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
it's impossible to say that

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
there is no self.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Exactly.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
But why many monks

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
they don't know is there?

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Well, because they are Potuchana's.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Yeah, maybe.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Like,

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
if somebody is not a Potuchana,

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
they would know,

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
they wouldn't be saying it.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
It's not written in sutra

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
that for Potuchana,

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
we can't say that there is no self.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Nothing written.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Nothing.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Nothing.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
I mean, Potuchana

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
should see through the nature of herself,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
that it cannot be his,

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
and that's why it becomes not self.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
It doesn't mean no self.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
It's not self.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
It's not self.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
It's not myself.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
I think that's not just that everywhere,

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
in the West, in the entire of everywhere.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
That's not just in Sri Lanka.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Because when anybody comes across Buddhism

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
on the superficial terms,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
that's the first thing you come across.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Ah, there is no self.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
And then that negative,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
like, becomes yourself.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Oh, yes.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
I don't believe in self.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
That's my self, believe.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
It's much harder than that.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
As I said before,

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
no, you actually have to first see

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
what your self is,

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
in order to stop regarding it as yours.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
And that's a very different thing.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
And that's why you have atta,

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
and then you have an atta,

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
like, not, no self,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
but not self.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
But that which is taken as self,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
and then understood as not self,

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
is still there.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
That thing doesn't change.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
But when you say no self,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
you just deny the whole thing.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
For us they are self,

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
but it's not self.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
There is that which used to be taken as self.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Used to be.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
Yeah, but now there is no self.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
No, self.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Or rather it's not self.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Not self.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Every experience of an arahant is not self.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
No, self.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
What does it mean that the eight-pukarande,

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
the one-pukarande,

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
the one-pukarande,

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
the one-pukarande,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
the one-pukarande,

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
the one-pukarande,

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
the part and the...

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Well, it means what I said before.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
It's only defined later.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
So the commentator,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
the interpretation of those mind moments

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
when you kind of want to

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
and then you enter into the...

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
You enter the path,

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
then you realize the fruit

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
to the next moment.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
It's just a lot of nonsense.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
In the certain means.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
And again,

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
even that division came from the Buddha,

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
from somebody who had such vision.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
But people might not know that,

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
necessarily for themselves.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Or for others.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
When you inside the public,

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
you can recognize an arahant.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
There is another sort,

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
I think,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I might mention before,

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
but Venerable Badiya,

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
wasn't it?

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
The dwarf.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
You've been marked it.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Well, no, no.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
You don't recognize it.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Yes.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
In Udanas,

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
when Sariputra was teaching

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
this monk,

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
thinking he still had work to do.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
But this monk was just sitting silently,

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
just hearing whatever Sariputra was saying.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
And then the Buddha saw the occasion

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
and he said,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Oh, look at the occasion.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Venerable Sariputra

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
is very diligently teaching

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
Venerable Badiya,

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
not knowing the Venerable Badi

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
is already an arahant.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
So he actually didn't have any work

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
to do any more.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
But there wasn't a parent.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
In Suta,

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
the clearly sweet one,

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
that A8,

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Pukaral,

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
one Pukaral,

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
one Pukaral,

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
what does it mean?

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Well, no.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
It's clearly written in terms of again,

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
and it's clearly written

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
that there are four stages of enlightenment.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
The Buddha talked about it.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Buddha said that

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
there is a somebody,

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
there is a difference,

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
within somebody with a sort of partner,

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
there is a difference

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
between somebody who

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
fully realized

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
that he's a sort of partner.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
And somebody who didn't quite yet realize

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
that he is actually a sort of partner.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
So in other words,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
you develop understanding

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
of the four-nover truths, for example.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
And you understood it.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
But now the benefits of that understanding

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
have not become a parent yet.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
And that's the difference

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
between the path and the fruit.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
For some people,

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
they understood it

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
and they understood it so hard

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
that the benefits

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
are pretty much immediate.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
For others,

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
they are not.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
But what the Buddha said

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
in relation to that,

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
is that if somebody has,

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
like in case of a sort of partner,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
somebody that is to the Dhamma,

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
the benefits will

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
have to be reached.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
If not before,

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
then at the moment of its death.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
And it's not nothing

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
kind of magical or mystical,

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
it simply means that

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
nature understanding of the Dhamma

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
basically goes through the nature of death

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
and panic and falling apart

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and losing aggregate.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
So if you understood that,

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
when those aggregates

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
do start falling apart,

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
you will fall apart

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
through that understanding.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Because that's what you have understood.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Which is why,

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
at the moment of death,

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
the latest,

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
you will get the benefits

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
of your understanding.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
And that's the same

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
for any of the aggregates.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Whether it's a sort of partner

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
and his fruit,

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
circling, I mean,

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
his fruit,

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
orangami and his fruit,

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
or oranghan,

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
then his fruit.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
There is a career

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
in between the

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Anagami and oranghan.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
What's up over here?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
No, there isn't.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
No, there isn't a career line at all.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That's why there's that

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
that suit them.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And those,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
all those monks came.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I don't know, hundreds of them.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And they all declared

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
an orangish.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And somebody has the Buddha

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
is that really the case?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And he said,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
some of them are truly

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
arahans, but some of them

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
overestimated themselves

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and they're still anagamis.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So, he didn't like,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
you know, they were not like

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
putunjanas completely

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
deluded thinking

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
they're arahans.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
No, they were anagamis,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
thinking they were arahans.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Road Buddha

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
but they couldn't.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
He could distinguish it.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Yeah.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
So, for road Buddha,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
there is a career line

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
between Anagami and oranghan.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yes.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Yeah, because he was

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
the same Buddha.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Only he can.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Well, only he can,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
or sometimes people

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
had the ability to see

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
other people's minds,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
especially when they could see.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But there was, you know,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
random.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
There was not a guarantee.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
So, that is a meaning

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
of Aikukara.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
It's basically,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
right, not career.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It's basically, as I said,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
it's one development.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
That's why somebody

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
can become an arahant

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
in the first watch of the night.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
But it doesn't mean,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
it's the same path

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
they walk.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's just how fast

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
they walk it.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And whether they stop

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
and the resting stops

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
or not.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
That's the difference.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
But it's one path.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It's the same path.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It's not, like,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
trying to achieve

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
four different things,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
or something like that.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And even those

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
four different things

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
are sometimes three different things.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
When he admitted

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Sakyadagami

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
from the descriptions.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Well, if you read

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
in the San Yutani kaya

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
part,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
but you think,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Sakyadagami means rebirth

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
in pure bones.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But there is the whole chapter

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
in San Yutani kaya

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
of Adanagami's.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
There are, like,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
hundreds of

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
different realms

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
within the pure bones,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
whereby

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
the Adanagami's

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
would be reborn,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
depending on

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
how big Adanagami's

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
they were.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Yeah.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So it's just like,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
it's, it's,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
well, it's kind of irrelevant

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
in that sense.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It's relevant in a sense

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
of abandoning the

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
ten fetters.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And that's something

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
something people can

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
contemplate in practice

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
in regard to.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
How far and what rebirth

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
unless they're

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
supernatural powers

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
or unless you live

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
with the Buddha

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
or somebody like that,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
it will be a distraction.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And it's not,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
it's not,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
it's not directly related

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
to the practice of Adanagami.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
It can be an encouragement

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
if it comes from,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
well, again,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
you don't need to have

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
somebody now.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
If you read the sutras,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
you can see what the Buddha

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
was saying in relation

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
to people who were

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
saying this, this, this,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
this.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And that can be an encouragement

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
to the ten.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Mm-hmm.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Mm-hmm.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Mm-hmm.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I was to know that,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
what did you mean

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
that you said that

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
what I see

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
bubble in the mind?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
You said that

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
that is a total sound,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
the total sight.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
What does it mean?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Or a total?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Five senses.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I don't know.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
For what they are

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
because of your mind.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
They will meet

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
in your mind.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Mm-hmm.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And because of that,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
the mind comes first,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
like the,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
is it the first verse

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
of Dhammapada?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
The mind is the four-run,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
of all things.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
So in other words,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
if you, like,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
if you have an object

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
of your sight,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
again,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
if you look at a flux

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
in front of you,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
see, you can't just

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
have a pure sight.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Because even colors

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
are distinguished

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
as different colors.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
What is it?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Well, your eyes

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
cannot distinguish.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Like, if your eyes

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
would operate

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
without your mind,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
well, it's inconceivable.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
You can't even think

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
like that.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
In other words,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
when you look at the

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
flask, there is already

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
a significance

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
implied in it.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
There is already a thought

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
of flask.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Even if you know,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
don't know the name,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
don't know what it is.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
There is a thought

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
of object being seen.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Mm-hmm.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And that's the sight.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Before, before you heard this,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
just up to the

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
with consciousness,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
and this is a ton of object,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
the ninth and the sense of organ.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
With the help of consciousness,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
the contact arise.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Then the sight is called

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
feeling.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It's not correct.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
The perception means that

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
this is perhaps.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Yeah, perception means perception.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
You see it?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
You don't feel your perception.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
You feel your feeling.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Feeling?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
No.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Oh, the supposition.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
There, you can be surprised.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
What kind of feeling?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Maybe nothing.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Maybe neutral feeling.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Yes.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But if it's perhaps something,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I don't know,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
something very significant

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
that some person gave you.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And if you look at that,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
then the feeling will arise.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
So it doesn't always.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
That's the thing.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Like, feeling has its own domain.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Perception has its own domain.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
If you want to understand it correctly,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
you have to start applying that understanding

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
to those domains correctly.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
In other words,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
if I ask you,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
how do you feel now?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
There has to be a feeling there.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And you can say,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
oh, I feel all right,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
which is a form of pleasure.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
You can say,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
well, I don't feel that well.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I'm a bit tired,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
which is a form of one pleasure.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
You can feel neutral.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
And that situation,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
that general situation of

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
you sitting here in this city,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
talking on Dhamma,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
that is already

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
something that you are perceiving peripherally,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
in your thoughts.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
It's present,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
because if I ask you,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
where are you now?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
You will immediately know where you are.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
You will have to stop and figure out.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Because it's already there,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
so you just have to access it with your attention.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Now, if you forget about that,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
which is where actually

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
where it should start,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
the contemplation starts to start

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
at the most general level you are capable of.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
But if you don't know that,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
then you will take a random object

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and try to examine it

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
on a scientific psychological

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
and then try to discover the nature of perception

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
and the nature of feeling.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
So I look at this thing in my hands.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
What do I feel?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Even if you get any understanding from that,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
it will be on the level of intellectual satisfaction.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Oh, yes, it makes sense.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But leaves the whole domain

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
of feeling and perception

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
on that general level,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
absolutely intact.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
So in other words,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
you have to start

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
from the opposite direction.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So you have to think,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
you are here,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
away from home,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
in this city,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
talking about Dhamma.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Or you can define it,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
whichever way you are.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But that's your current situation.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Within that situation,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
there are objects around you.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Within those objects,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
they are more particular objects.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They are more important objects.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
They are less important objects.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
They are more useful objects like that cushion.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
They are less useful objects like that being

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
that you don't need at the moment.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
And that's all within that experience

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
as a whole of you being in this room

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
sitting down and talking.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
So that was the demandfulness

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
of the body postures

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
works on that level.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
If you are aware of your body posture,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
that's almost like the most general thing

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
that determines your current situation.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And that situation is perceived,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
that situation is felt,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
that situation is intended.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
What's the technique at the...

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And on the level of that situation

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
is where the contact happens.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And only because you are already contacted,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
you can distinguish all these particular things

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
around you with your eyes, ears, nose, and so on.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
So in that general situation,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
is where the three meet.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:13.000
They don't meet like cause and effect

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
as often the commenter is in terms of

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
you have one hand, another hand,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
you have the sense organs

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
and the consciousness

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
and the meat and the sound is the sound

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
to whatever it was.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
No, the sound is the contact.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I forgot it.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
But the point is...

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
They don't meet like that.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Well, even the nature of meeting

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
is timeless.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
It does not involve time.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Clapping hands involve time.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
You can put it as simple as that.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Salayatana is part of the Patitson Pada.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Whatever is part of the Patitson Pada,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
she is the principal of the Patitson Pada,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
otherwise it wouldn't be included there.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
So it means that conscious matter

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
is already there.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And if things come in range

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
as the Buddha said,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
the corresponding engagement occurs.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
But it doesn't occur always.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So if things come in range,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
that can be the cause for the contact.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
But then also consciousness

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
and their working sense organs

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
are a matter

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
are required.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Because if something happens to them,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
there won't be any sight arising.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
There won't be any hearing

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
or anything like that.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
If your ear organs are damaged

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
or whatever, even while you're still alive,

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
that's it.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
They'll stop working.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Would there be any explanation there

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
about the lambda and coma?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Well, like,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
the Buddha did refer to a thing called

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
the Ayusankara,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
that upon which life depends,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
like vitality.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
So sometimes you can be brained

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
that the body can be almost

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
completely dysfunctional

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
but not quite.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And for as long as it's not quite,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
there might be still some vitality,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
vitality left in the body,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
in which case,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
people wake up from the coma

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
or something like that.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
But sometimes they just don't.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Well, there is a state of cessation

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
and perception and feeling,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
where breathing stops

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
in meditation.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
You're just the ultimate

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
form of development of your mind,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
whereby, like,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
you don't even breathe.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
That's it.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
The man,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
when her ex,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
when her husband came to visit her

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and she thought he became

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
sort of one,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
and he asked what's the difference

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
between somebody who is dead

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
and somebody who is

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
cessation and perception of feeling.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Instead, the difference is that the one

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
who is sensation and perception of feeling

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
still has his life vitality left.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
So he returns.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.360
on the level of metaphysics, but yeah, the relationship

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.880
between consciousness and body is external.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.520
Conscious is not internal in the body.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.640
And I think the Buddha compared in the suitors

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.080
like a gem.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.520
And if there is a thread running clearly through the gem,

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.720
that's like conscious body.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.400
But there are completely two different things.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.640
Thread is not part of the gem.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.840
Gem is not part of the thread.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.080
It's entrapped in the gem.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.000
And that's what Yenavira referred to it, actually.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:48.500
Yeah.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.960
He didn't say that body and consciousness

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.880
are superimposed.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.120
He said they're jacks to post.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.480
Means they're completely indifferent to each other.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.400
He's just an occurrence of them coming together,

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.120
but not merging together.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.120
They come together.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.200
And as a result of that overlap,

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.600
you get Nama Rupa, which you can designate.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.600
So you can ever directly access matter.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.880
Nor can you ever directly access consciousness.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.800
You can abandon matter by fully understanding it.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.760
Sorry.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.360
By fully understanding consciousness,

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.360
you remove the footing for the matter.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.240
In other words, you stop misunderstanding

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.600
that overlap of conscious body.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.920
But well, it helped me.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.120
And I think it's probably more happened because everybody,

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.240
but they fault assumes consciousnesses inside

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.960
and everything else is external.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.360
And I did actually remember that I didn't

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.840
make much out of it at the time.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.440
But when I was reading existential philosophy

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.400
such and they were talking in terms of things

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.120
were being, like, not things are conscious

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.400
in terms of the dead matter has consciousness in it.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.160
But no, their consciousness is out there with the things,

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:07.920
not in them.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:14.760
In other words, that's why you have six types of consciousness

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.880
because you have six senses.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.480
Every sense, the sun's things are there.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.000
And the only reason it can be sun is because consciousness

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.160
is there with those things.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.320
So the conscious matter.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.280
And then if there is ignorance present,

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.400
when that contact arises, well, the contact will arise

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.560
as a result of you feeling conflicted.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:46.840
So if you appropriate the contact, then you're contacted.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:50.480
So contact always pertains to sense of self.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.200
But if you see that thing out there already

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.120
a reason the conscious matter means, oh,

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.040
you can't do anything about it.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.000
You can't prevent consciousness from disassociating

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.840
from the matter if it decides to do that.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.400
Which is, I think what happens when sometimes people

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.520
lose their mind and they go cut-atonic.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.800
They go completely like dead motionless.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.000
Nor can you prevent that matter to be destroyed.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.360
You absolutely know.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:24.880
You can't even conceive having say in it.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.280
It's just beyond your range.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.040
Yet your entire life depends upon it.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.600
So that's the parallel situation.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.160
So if you realize that your consciousness

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.640
is as external as this matter that you see

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.720
and you have no say in it, then it ceases to be yours.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.120
And then when corresponding engagement occurs,

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.200
you see that occurring as a result of things

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.640
that you have no say in it.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.800
Therefore, whatever occurs on their account,

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.520
you have no say in that either.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.760
It's not yours.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.680
Near this experience, how old is it?

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.200
Some people have seen that they are the body either.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.120
Well, I don't know.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.840
Yeah, hard to say really.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.080
It's quite early.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.760
I'm sure something happens, but people use words differently.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.120
They say they saw their body.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.240
But without any ice, how old is it?

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.760
Yeah, I see that's the thing.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.760
Some people.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:17.760
I don't know.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.840
As I say, it's hard to know what people mean

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.040
when they describe these things.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:29.080
Because they might use certain words.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.640
They would mean something for you, something else for them.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.800
So they would say, oh, I saw my body.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.000
You might have well been a thought of their body,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.080
a thought of them abandoning the body.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.440
But because it was a real life and death experience,

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.400
that thought was very significant.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.600
It was so real as they would usually describe it.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.440
It was as real as if I was looking at my body over there.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:59.640
It can be that, or who knows, really.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.120
I mean, when people even try to explain mundane things,

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.080
often misunderstanding happens.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.640
Because you realize they're using the same words you know,

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.920
but completely differently.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.120
They meant something completely different.

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.600
Imagine when you try to explain such personal things

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.880
or when people try to talk about spiritual thoughts

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.600
or whatever else, and you get all like, well,

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.800
you can't make sense out of it.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.400
Because what it means for them doesn't necessarily

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.160
mean other things to others.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.040
But that's exactly why the Buddha did

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.120
refer to the miracle of teaching.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.600
He said, if a person understood the Dharma,

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.880
he's able to convey that to another.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.360
And then they understand it.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.000
That's what that equals a miracle.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Why?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.120
Because the Dharma is so personal, the sense of self,

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.520
the senses and everything, that there is no way

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.880
that when I say something in regard to senses,

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.960
another person will think exactly the same thing,

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.120
unless we're both aren't, so something like that.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.280
Because it's so personal that the meaning of it

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.880
is so personal.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.160
So it really needs to be, you need to dig through it

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.360
and see what it's meant.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.440
That, I think a mother said before, again,

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.760
it's like, when I said, you can just take these five aggregates,

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.640
poly terms, Rupa, Vedana, Sainas and Karavinyana,

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.080
and just take the English words, or Japanese words for them.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.920
And think about it, and see how much we do,

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.640
you actually understand.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.120
How do I remember when I was reading the sutras

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.000
and then the consciousness?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.800
And you just read all your consciousness.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.800
But then the spot wants to think, well,

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.600
OK, forget about it, Pali.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.160
Forget about the sutras.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.720
Just use the word consciousness that I think I know.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.080
What is it?

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.200
What, like, when I say consciousness,

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.440
what is that that this designation consciousness

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.960
stands for in my experience?

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.200
What is it?

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.800
And then you realize, OK, consciousness is very hard.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.520
Why don't I start with easy matter?

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.880
And then you start, and then you realize that's equally hard.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.440
So what is that matter then?

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.560
And you realize, if you were to fully understand

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.360
these five designations, you would be an adult.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.160
Because there is no difference between intellectual understanding

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.000
or real understanding.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.600
Understanding is understanding.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.920
You can start intellectually or non-intellectually,

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.560
but understanding that it's the same arrival.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.600
So you might start pondering about it.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.520
And as long as you're not doing, like,

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:35.280
scholastic comparison between the words and the truth,

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.280
if you're really trying to see what designation consciousness

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.760
stands in your experience, that's when the sutras,

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.160
if you read something, they say, think twice.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.800
When they say, first-genre, first-genre, what is first-genre?

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.160
Or they say something else, they repeat it twice.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.080
That's basically the way you're bringing it to the mind.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.680
And then to see that, that you just brought to your mind

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.960
in your experience, for what it stands for.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.760
Not just kind of an example, it's called an explain it,

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.920
or draw the parallel to the drawing or whatever, a scheme.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:14.200
But they really understand, if consciousness, consciousness,

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.720
that I just said, what is that, what I said?

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.640
What is it that this saying stands for?

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.120
What is that?

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.320
What did I just designate in my experience

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.600
when I said feeling?

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.600
What is feeling now that I said it?

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.520
And the fact that you said feeling means it stands for something.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.320
It designates something.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.640
So you really have to push as hard as far as you need to

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:44.160
until same feeling stands for that which feeling really is,

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.120
not for your idea of what feeling is,

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.080
or for your misunderstanding of what feeling is.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:55.000
And you can see how many people have not understood this

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.160
by seeing how many people cannot distinguish between what they perceive

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.320
and what they feel, or what they intend.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:08.160
And it's all like a jungle, just everything and everything.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.400
Is it that I remember that you sent me

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.560
that I can know some meditation something,

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.080
you are a disciple, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:20.680
No, that was Dukka, on Dukka.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.400
It was written that the difference,

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.840
the perception, the difference between the Dara and the Puduceno

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.280
is the Arahat and when you see the chair, he doesn't think it is his.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.960
But Puduceno thinks it is his chair.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.000
Only that is a difference, is it true?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Well, it's slightly subtler than that.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.480
He might not think that's my chair,

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.800
because if it's his chair, I won't think it's my chair.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:48.080
But I can think that chair is for me to sit on.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:48.840
For me?

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.080
Yeah.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.040
Not in the market.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.760
It's for me to sit on.

01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.960
Like the chair, the significance of the chair, is for sitting.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.920
It's to be sat on.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.720
And that doesn't necessarily mean sense of self.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.880
But when somebody who holds sense of self and self,

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.880
you approaches it, he will inevitably take it like that.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:18.480
So when a Puduceno sees a chair or any other sign,

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:24.680
a cup to drink water from, it will be a cup is for my eye

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.360
to drink water from.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:29.320
It's for me to drink water from.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.360
The chair is for me to sit on.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.400
And that's already a sense of self.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.520
For me?

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.360
The Puduceno sees the opposite, the river.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.120
Oh, what's happening?

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.040
I never think that it's my river.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:44.560
That's fine.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.440
But as I said, seeing the river outside,

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:52.200
it's only a particular object within the general situation

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.360
that you're in.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.440
And yourself is on the general level.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.440
You'll never see your sense of self on the level

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.120
where you're seeing.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.720
Your sense of self is in that peripheral situation

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.680
that determines everything particular that's

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.640
right in front of you.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.640
That's why people never can ever understand an atom

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.400
and they go about.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.360
And, oh, that's not real.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.200
That doesn't exist.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.440
See, it's so constantly changing.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.280
I just destroyed it.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.840
It means it's impermanent.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.520
Those are all objects of your senses.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.480
And your sense of self is way deeper than that.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.880
It's on the level of that situation I was telling you about.

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.360
Yeah.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:27.880
Oh, yeah.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.640
So you are standing here from which position

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.120
you can see the river out there.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.560
That's already something you perceive as one thing.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.720
That's one thing.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.160
Very general thing.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.720
And your sense of self is on that level.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.080
And that's where it has to be understood.

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.280
So if you look at the river out there

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.000
and start looking at your sense of self there,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.360
then you already forgot half of the image.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:06.080
What does it mean that you said that because of sense of self,

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.080
I think that there is a front contact feeling, right?

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.120
The next perception reason, next method formation.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.600
I see this process because of sense of self.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.520
What does it mean?

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.160
Otherwise, it doesn't think for contact.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.000
Well, that process, as I said before,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.080
it's not really a process like that.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.320
It's all simultaneous.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:28.360
So you can't think one, two, three, four, five,

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.400
occurring one after the other.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:35.880
When ignorance, there is contact.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.440
When ignorance, contact.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.280
That's all you can say.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.960
If the contact is manifest,

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.920
means ignorance is present there, right there and there.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.920
For as long as contact is being manifested.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.960
Contact, you mean that the...

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.160
Meaning being touched by things.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.400
Before and they have contact.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.760
No, they don't have ignorance.

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.920
So there is nothing to be contacted.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.600
Contact about what do you mean by contact?

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.280
Being touched.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.280
Means having...

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.880
Expaling your objects in the sense of the...

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.160
No, not necessarily, no.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.160
Not necessarily.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.160
As you see, you can be very indifferent to the external objects.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.480
Care about the flask, I can care about the river.

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.080
I can care about anything.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.880
But you can still be able to do that.

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.960
Yeah, aren't they have experience?

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.400
Well, no, I don't, they haven't done everything properly

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.200
on the level of that situation.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:31.680
In other words, if you are not,

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.200
if there is no sense of self

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.240
on the most general level

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.640
of Michael sitting in a cave with him,

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.000
leaning on the cushion, talking about it down,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.960
that's one experience, very general.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.760
And you can define it as far as you want.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.640
It still remains one experience

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.960
as a whole, general.

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.960
If you abandon that,

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.920
then whatever comes in front of you,

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.520
particularly,

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.840
pleasing with this pleasing,

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.000
or neutral, or extremely pleasing,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.800
or extremely pleasing, or neutral,

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.360
you won't be moved by it, why?

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.480
Because you abandon its foundations.

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:16.400
And the foundations is the situation as a whole.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.720
But if you keep chasing after particular objects,

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.240
you're not seeing the bigger picture,

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.560
and that's where the problem is.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.360
I abandon you now, or what do you mean by that?

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.960
Full understanding, not regarding his ears.

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.680
OK, let's try it this.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.160
Michael, in the cave, it's not easy.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.280
It's not easy to understand.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.320
So you don't have to, yeah, you don't have to worry about it.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.160
Well, maybe a little bit,

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.800
because it can keep you going, but

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.240
Michael, in the cave,

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:52.240
living in a cushion, talking about the dharma.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.240
That's a thought,

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.240
but not just a thought.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.240
That's a thought that stands for your actual experience right now,

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.240
which means it's a very general experience,

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.240
very real as such.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.240
And that's your situation,

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.240
and you can stop there now,

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.240
because that situation remains unchanged.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.240
Whether we talk quickly, or slowly,

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.240
or stop talking for a moment,

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.240
it's still Michael in the cave,

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.240
living in a cushion, talking about the dharma.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.240
So in that sense, it's independent of the particular.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.240
So even if you move the cushion,

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.240
if you're not living on the cushion,

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.240
it's still generally Michael in the cave.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.240
Within Michael sitting in the cave,

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.240
she leans on the cushion, sits on the floor,

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.240
and then within that, she talks the dharma.

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.240
She might stop talking about dharma,

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.240
she's still living on the cushion,

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.240
sitting on the floor in the cave.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.240
She might stand up, stop leaning on the cushion.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.240
She's still in the cave.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.240
So that's how it's hierarchically ordered.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.240
So you don't have to understand all of it.

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.240
You can take one of those levels,

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.240
which is the body posture.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.240
I'm being seated right now.

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.240
That's a general thought that stands for your actual body posture.

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.240
And you can establish your mindfulness upon that.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.240
Now see, the thing is,

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.240
Michael in the cave sitting in the floor talking dharma

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.240
is the fundamental situation you're in.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.240
But if you look at it,

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:29.240
would it be possible for you to sit in this cave

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.240
that you can see now,

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.240
if there is no cave here,

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.240
or if somebody destroys it?

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.240
Would it be possible for you to sit on the floor

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.240
or lean on the cushion if I take the cushion?

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.240
It wouldn't.

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.240
So you realize that these objects of your senses,

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.240
things you can actually see and hear and touch,

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.240
in that indirect manner, not directly,

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.240
like this is not mine, this is not mine.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.240
But in that indirect manner,

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.240
they indicate that that situation as a whole,

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:06.240
the general mindful picture, is not independent.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.240
It depends upon these very particular objects.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.240
Because if they're removed,

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.240
at any point,

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.240
this general situation cannot remain standing.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:19.240
And the utmost general situation is your body.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.240
The whole world is within your body.

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.240
And if your body is removed,

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.240
your whole world goes.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.240
It's the same principle.

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.240
So if the body goes,

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.240
the one you can see,

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240
you can see in the mirror,

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.240
like you can see in others.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.240
If that's taken,

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.240
none of the general situation,

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.240
none of the most lofty feelings or thoughts

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.240
can remain standing.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.240
So that's the relationship

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.240
with peripheral and actual understanding

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240
about the needs to be understood.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240
Because that's how it works.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.240
If you forget about the peripheral,

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:58.240
general,

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.240
you just end up chasing these particular objects.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.240
But you're not seeing them correctly.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.240
You don't see them as mutually determined

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.240
in the general situation.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.240
You just see them in a very linear manner,

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.240
which is on the level of science,

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.240
scholastics,

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.240
or I don't know,

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.240
medicine,

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.240
any form of like natural psychology,

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.240
all of that is just linear observation.

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.240
But it doesn't reveal the timeless principle

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240
of mutual dependence.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:31.240
But it's no better.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.240
Because for as long as the case is present,

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.240
your situation of being in the cave

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.240
can be maintained.

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.240
But then vice versa.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.240
If there was no intention for you

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.240
to be in the cave in the first place,

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.240
this particular cave you see,

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.240
you wouldn't have come here,

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:49.240
therefore you wouldn't have seen it.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:52.240
So as much as the particular things,

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.240
determine your general situation,

01:29:54.240 --> 01:30:00.240
general situation defines the particular things.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.240
So in terms of the practice of mindfulness,

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.240
works along those levels.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.240
If you have a thought,

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.240
no matter how distant,

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.240
but even a little bit present,

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.240
in the back of your mind,

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.240
that you are in this cave.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.240
If that's established as an anchor,

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.240
what I said before,

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.240
whatever you do,

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.240
while you are in the cave,

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.240
you'll be mindful of that.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.240
Without having to trace

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.240
every particular thing you do

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:31.240
while you are in the cave.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.240
Or you can anchor yourself in

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.240
being seated on the floor.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:37.240
Whatever you do,

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.240
whatever you think,

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.240
whatever you say,

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.240
while you remain seated on the floor,

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.240
if you are established upon the thought

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.240
of being seated on the floor,

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.240
you'll be mindful of whatever you do.

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.240
Because mindfulness is about

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.240
not chasing these particular things,

01:30:53.240 --> 01:31:04.240
but being established in regard to them.

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:07.240
And it's already seen as dependent.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:09.240
Well, you don't have to like

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.240
strain yourself in terms of always seeing it

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.240
because it's already there.

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:16.240
You just have to remember

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.240
and step back into it.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.240
Because your situation of sitting on the floor

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.240
in the cave is already there

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.240
and it's still there.

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.240
And even if you stop thinking about it,

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:25.240
it's still there.

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.240
Because the body is still in that situation.

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:31.240
That's why you can reestablish mindfulness.

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:33.240
And the more skilled you become,

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.240
the quicker you reestablish it.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.240
The more skilled you become

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:40.240
in recognizing the things

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.240
that you can use to establish your mindfulness on.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.240
And that's a very different

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.240
type of practice than what you get.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.240
The Bermis retreat centers,

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.240
when you're all about focusing and staring

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.240
and observing and trying to catch

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.240
the particular moment.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.240
That's as mindful as you can get.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.240
And you end up forcing yourself into that,

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.240
more and more,

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.240
which is why all those people

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:14.240
get very intense.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.240
Yeah.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:21.240
So, it means that you don't need to worry so much

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.240
and what's feeling or what's the perception or what is the feeling.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.240
Well, that's the thing.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.240
Like, you can if you choose that as an approach,

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.240
but you don't have to understand everything

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:32.240
at once all the time.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.240
You need to develop mindfulness

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.240
to the extent necessary

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.240
when understanding is developed

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:41.240
to a sufficient degree where

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:44.240
you don't take things to be yours anymore.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.240
It doesn't mean that you actually have to go around destroying things

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.240
or giving things up.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.240
I octane this because it's not mine.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.240
It wasn't you able to begin with.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:56.240
So, how can you even give it away?

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:02.240
So, and again, you can be mindful in regard

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:06.240
to any of the feeling, perception or intentions

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.240
through this form of mindfulness.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.240
So, if you're mindful,

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:13.240
sitting of your situation and your body posture,

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.240
and then feeling arises

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.240
while you're seated in the cave.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.240
It's your mindful in regard to that.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:23.240
Oh, you can choose feeling to be

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.240
the anchor of your mindfulness.

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.240
You say, I'm feeling this way now.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.240
While I feel like that through that,

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.240
I'm feeling this, through that, I'm feeling that.

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.240
And that's why in Anapurna Satisood

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.240
the Buddha said, when he was talking about

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.240
the development of mindfulness, he said,

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.240
while breathing in like this,

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.240
I feel like that.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.240
While breathing in like that,

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:50.240
I'll observe my whole body.

01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:52.240
While breathing in, breathing out,

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.240
breathing in, breathing both,

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.240
I will experience my body in this way.

01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.240
I will feel this.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.240
I will feel pleasure.

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.240
So, you actually do it rightly.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.240
By doing it rightly,

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.240
you end up recognizing it rightly.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.240
And that's why it brings the

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.240
force of the pathanas to complete

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.240
fulfillment in regard to body,

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:15.240
in regard to feeling, in regard to thoughts,

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.240
in regard to mind, in regard to mind,

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:20.240
in regard to thoughts.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:26.240
So, you can do it actively,

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.240
you can do it passively.

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.240
Like while I'm seated right here,

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.240
breathing, I'm going to be thinking this.

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.240
Oh, while I'm seated here breathing,

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.240
these thoughts are arising.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.240
That's passive.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.240
You know they're actually actively thinking,

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.240
but you're just recognizing what your mind does.

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.240
I was practicing this as a director,

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.240
whatever I think the mind,

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.240
any kind of thought.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:02.240
Any kind of thought.

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:06.240
Just see the...

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.240
Not mind means it for everything is appearing on their own standards.

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.240
Yeah, but the thing is,

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.240
you have to know what not mind is,

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.240
in order to be able to see particular things

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.240
as they arise, as not mind.

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:23.240
So, first the right view needs to be developed,

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.240
in order to be applied.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.240
So, when I said that,

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.240
the nobody's argument should be contemplating,

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:35.240
this is not mind, not for me, not I am.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.240
Not myself, and you should...

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.240
That requires the right view.

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.240
You won't work otherwise.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.240
Everything is appearing on their own.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:45.240
Is it not in the...

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.240
Well, it is, but the thing is,

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.240
when you're like,

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.240
whatever arises,

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.240
and then you regard it as not mind,

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.240
it's almost like a form of management for a pathogen.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:58.240
You need to think to arise first,

01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:59.240
and then you can...

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.240
Oh, this is not mind.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.240
But actually,

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.240
you don't want to think to arise as yours to begin with.

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.240
You don't want to have to do anything.

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.240
That's what freedom means.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.240
That's what I don't lay down his burden,

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.240
done his work,

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.240
in every conceivable regard.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.240
There is no shoot for him anymore, in any way.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:28.240
So if your practice is about doing things when this arises,

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.240
that requires that thing to keep arising.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:35.240
So you want to start focusing on your practice,

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.240
taking you to a place whereby

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:42.240
arising things won't require you to do anything anymore.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.240
In other words,

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.240
when they will not arise as yourself,

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.240
because the only reason you can...

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.240
Well, the only reason you have to

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.240
be saying to whatever arises,

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.240
this is not mind,

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.240
is because you first took his yours,

01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.240
and then you say it's not mind.

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:01.240
So you want to stop taking it as yours,

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:05.240
and then you can stop saying it's not mind.

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.240
Because now it's true, it's not mind.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.240
And again,

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.240
that's the difference between this general peripheral situation

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.240
you're in,

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.240
while you're looking at these particular things.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.240
Do you take things as yours on this general level?

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:30.240
Well, that's what a sense of self is.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:32.240
So then trying to address the particular things

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.240
that arise at you,

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.240
as not me, not mind,

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.240
actually leaves.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.240
If you don't see the connection

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.240
between the particular,

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.240
determining the general,

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:45.240
and general defining the particular in return,

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.240
your application of not mind, not me,

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:52.240
won't work, just doesn't apply to anything.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.240
But if you see that,

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:59.240
if I regard these particular things as not belonging to me,

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.240
while I see those particular things determining

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.240
this sense of me,

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:07.240
well, that's a different story then.

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.240
But that can only be done if you're fully aware

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.240
of the situation as it has a reason,

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:13.240
if the mindfulness is developed

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:15.240
in a sufficient extent,

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.240
to be aware of the situation

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:21.240
while the particular things are coming and going.

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.240
And then it can work.

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:35.240
Something that the mindfulness of body

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.240
or whatever,

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.240
something gets lost.

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.240
Like, it happens even for earlier.

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:45.240
It's just because you put it generally.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.240
It happens.

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.240
Well, like,

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.240
for earlier, less and less,

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.240
and for an other hand,

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.240
forgetting things,

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.240
forgetting particular things,

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:08.240
does not induce ignorance anymore.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.240
So when you forget something,

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.240
then you remember it.

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:14.240
There was no ignorance induced in you,

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.240
forgetting.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:18.240
No sense of self-induced,

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.240
no appropriation induced,

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.240
no pedan induced.

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.240
For putugina, that's not the case.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.240
When putugina forgets,

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.240
his habits,

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.240
when he's in the state of forgetfulness,

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.240
are habits of putugina,

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.240
are habits that maintain a Vija

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.240
and everything else.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.240
So that's why,

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.240
that you cannot possibly be

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:45.240
100% mindful all the time.

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:48.240
It doesn't work like that.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.240
What you want to do is try to be mindful

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:51.240
as much as you can,

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.240
and while you're mindful,

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.240
understand the things.

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.240
And then when you forget,

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:59.240
like when Adahans,

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.240
or even Adahs,

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.240
when they were,

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.240
when they were around

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:09.880
I was still a sort of runner, and when Sari put a diet, he was very shaken, he was very

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.960
effective, but he said, everything went black, and the clouds were dark, and I couldn't

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:18.760
... 20 years I've been serving the Lord and listening to the devil and I couldn't remember

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:19.760
a single thing.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.840
But it doesn't mean that he stopped being a sort of runner.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:30.960
Means when whatever the pressing circumstances were gone, things were back to normal or

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:43.960
earlier.

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:49.360
When the sense of self is, when you are reflecting, when you are thinking, whether

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:55.680
mindfully or not, there is an implication of me, that's the sense of self.

01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:02.800
And that's what I meant.

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:09.360
When he might be forgetful in regard to things, that doesn't imply a sense of self anymore,

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:17.040
because self and the whole appropriation thing is not in the things, it's in a relationship

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.160
with the things, which means there is always a degree of awareness in that.

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:28.560
So forgetfulness is in regard to particular things, but forgetfulness as an experience is

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:38.000
something you can be mindful of, it's present, and it's something you don't have to forget.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.800
And on that level is the level where the sense of self arises.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:46.920
So that's why even when the act of forgetting does not adhere to the ignorance of the sense

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:51.040
of self anymore, that's when you know that mindfulness is being developed.

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:56.920
And you can afford to forget particular things, but obviously you forget less and less

01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:01.880
of the nature of things, and generally you remember what better if the mindfulness is

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.520
developed, because that's how memory works.

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:12.480
And as I said, if you remember, if you remember that you are here in this cave, if you don't

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:18.120
forget that, whatever you're doing on account that you've been in the cave, you can be mindful

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:21.400
in regard to that.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:25.280
Then you forget that you're in the cave, but the things you're still in the cave, then

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.480
you can remember that you're in the cave, and you're establishing mindfulness, obviously

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:30.280
a situation.

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:33.040
But I don't mean that now you just have to keep thinking I'm in the cave, I'm in the

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:34.040
cave.

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.560
Now the point of mindfulness is to recognize this relationship between peripheral and

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:41.040
actual, between general and particular.

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:46.240
So you're mindful in the cave, that's it.

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:52.720
Now through that mindfulness, while you're in the cave, do things.

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:57.320
Talk, sit, walk, whatever, well, you will be doing inevitably something, even if it's

01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:02.440
nothing, I'm just sitting, well, that's something you're doing while you're in the cave.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.280
And that's mindfulness.

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:11.720
And that's how the memory works, and if you read the sutras, that's why they always,

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.880
when whoever would be related to the sutra, well, when they were on under the sutras, they

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.680
said, that's a habit.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.240
On one occasion, the Lord was staying in this province.

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:28.240
While he was staying in that occasion, in this province, he visited this forest.

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.240
While he was staying in that province, visited this forest, he was sitting under the root

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:33.560
of tree.

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:39.240
While he was in the province, in that forest, under the root of the tree, these people came

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.640
to visit.

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:45.000
So it's situation within, situation within, situation within, situation within, situation

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
within, and that's infinite.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
There's none to it.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:53.160
You can go as particular as you can observe, and as general as you can hold.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.320
The point is not to kind of find the beginning with the end of it.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:02.160
The point is to fully understand the relationship between more general and then more particular,

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.560
because that's how mindfulness is established.

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:10.320
So you don't have to necessarily start, oh, I mean, this province, in this forest, under

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.880
this tree, you can just start with the body posture, because it would be implied.

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:21.720
Well, you can just, while I'm under the root, while I'm under this tree, under the

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.920
root of the tree, these people came to visit.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.360
While I'm still seated, under the root of this tree, we were talking about this.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:33.960
While I'm seated, under the tree, and we were talking about this, they asked me this

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:34.960
particular question.

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:39.720
Within that question, I gave this particular answer, and you end up remembering the whole

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:45.280
thing, as opposed to linearly trying to list and just hold everything in mind at the same

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.280
time.

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:49.280
It doesn't work like that.

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.480
And that's how sometimes there is a, like, the establishment of mind in the suitors

01:44:52.480 --> 01:45:01.440
when they would have said the monk goes off and lives in the forest, and then he observes

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:09.160
while in this forest, any perceptions and feelings, disturbances, based on the perceptions

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:15.760
of the village, cannot arise, because I'm in the forest.

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:21.920
So then he sets his mind like that, establishes it upon the perceptions of the forest.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:29.400
So in the morning, when he goes to the village, he might see unsuitable sites, hear unsuitable

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:34.680
things, things they will provoke last, diversion and delusion, but because his mind is established

01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:39.960
upon perception of the forest, none of these things can touch him.

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.360
They cannot disturb him.

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:46.920
And then he reflects further, he says, because I'm established upon the more refined perception

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:52.480
of the forest, perceptions of the village cannot disturb me.

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:57.040
Any disturbance in the rise will be on account of perceptions of the forest, because that's

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.320
what the mind is.

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:04.480
And he can go further, he can establish his mind upon the perception of the earth as

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.440
general as it is, element of earth.

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:16.160
And now, not even perceptions of the particular forest can bother him any more, let alone

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:20.480
the village.

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:25.120
So that's like the contemplation of the four elements, that's how it works.

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.440
More general, the most general is earth, water, fire and air.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.800
It doesn't get more general than that.

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.200
Yet, as subtle as it is, the mind can get established.

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:42.400
And the Buddha said, I'll be like earth, or be like fire, when you contemplate the nature

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:47.600
of the earth, you get established through the mindfulness of the earth.

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:51.640
You don't even say element of earth, because a lot of people are in the implies of

01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:52.640
you, element.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:58.960
You just say earth, designation of earth, stands for solidity, stands for heart, stands

01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:03.360
for earth, and that's it.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:09.880
You establish the mind, and that's the meditation of casinos, that's exactly that.

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:15.760
Not nothing to do with what people do, exert color discs and stuff like that, they're

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.480
just from serious misunderstanding.

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:25.560
And then the ultimate casina, the ultimate establishment, is the establishment upon the

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:31.720
casina of consciousness.

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.520
So in the same sense that you establish upon the perceptions of the forest and established

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:42.760
upon earth, and so on, you can get established upon consciousness.

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:51.480
Why? Because if you establish upon the nature of presence, in regard to that which is

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:58.360
present, then whatever is present cannot disturb you.

01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.920
Because you're established in regard to the nature of presence of that which is present.

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:06.560
So you cannot disturb you.

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.120
And literally whatever you experience is present, which means whatever you experience

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:12.800
cannot disturb you anyway.

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.080
And the Buddha said that the ultimate, that's the supreme, the most refined casina you

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.640
can get established.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.880
But you don't need to go that far, even the first element of earth is enough to abandon

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:27.080
everything inferior to it, as the Buddha will refer to it, which is everything.

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:35.400
Because again, whatever arises in your experience has a degree, has an element of solidity in

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:40.120
it, has an element of earth present, a phenomenon of earth present.

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:44.440
If you establish upon that, you're surmounted everything that has that, and everything

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:47.120
has that, which means you're surmounted everything.

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:56.680
In my case, in my medicine station, now practice what I'm doing, it's all those things

01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:03.720
are also with different things, like in my case, when you have thoughts coming up, or

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:09.880
bubbles as you refer to it, whatever it's different perceptions, try not to forget about

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:15.120
the general situation you're in.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:20.640
The fact that you're sitting in your room, on the floor, or on the chair, that's already

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:25.160
the situation, seated in such and such situation.

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.800
That's a general thought, that's one experience.

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:35.200
Within that, and while you are in that position and that thought, whatever you're thinking

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:38.240
of, whatever you're feeling, whatever you're hearing, whatever you're seeing, you can

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:41.440
be mindful of that, from that perspective.

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:47.040
But if you forget about the general situation, then you'll end up chasing every particular

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:53.120
thought or perception of earth, and that's a problem, that there is no mindfulness there,

01:49:53.120 --> 01:50:00.120
no rather very little mindfulness, not established.

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:12.040
So, in that case, I was thinking that the need to see all the bubbles, this is not mine,

01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:17.400
and that these bubbles are calling it as I am, and the same view and the dependent relation

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:18.400
I have to think of.

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.880
Now we'll see the problem with that is I am seeing all of this, which means your general

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:26.120
sense of why it remains unaffected.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:32.720
You have to reverse that, you have to start indirectly, whereby you see yourself first

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.920
in this situation, while you're in that situation, whatever is in front of you, you start

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:39.280
being mindful of that.

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:45.360
When that mindfulness is established enough, it becomes apparent then, like you don't

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:52.520
see it, you don't invent it, you just discern it as already there.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:58.600
And what is already there is that, as I said before, the general situation during defines

01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:04.280
these particular bubbles and thoughts and perceptions, but they are the ones enabling the

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:09.960
general situation to be such in the first place.

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:16.120
So you recognize that relationship with the dependence between this general and particular

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:22.760
level, out there, not me and I am doing it, not in front of me, not for me, it's just

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:27.040
there, because you are there sitting in the room, while you are there sitting in the room,

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:31.320
you are thinking certain things, while you are sitting in the room on your chair, looking

01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:36.200
through the window, you are thinking certain things.

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:40.120
Would you be thinking those things, if you are not in that room sitting in that chair looking

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:43.840
through the window, you might well not be thinking that.

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:48.600
So your general situation determines, defines these certain things, defines significance

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:53.400
of those things, thought in that situation.

01:51:53.400 --> 01:52:01.160
But then again, if you are not thinking in your room on your chair, like if there was

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:05.080
no chair, there was no room, no window, you are not thinking, would you be able to have

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:09.960
a situation of me sitting on the chair looking through the window thinking these things?

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:13.920
You couldn't.

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:22.160
So that's how they depend on each other, and none of it can be yours for that very reason.

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:25.640
Does mindfulness on body mean that not only the body, the situation on the ground?

01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:30.360
Yeah, mindfulness on the body means mindfulness on the situation, the body is in.

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:37.040
Not the actual physical posture, and observing of like, oh, this is how my knee feels and

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:41.240
this is probably something, that's all already because you are in that situation, you can

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:44.200
look at those particular things.

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:51.320
And you can, if you want, while you are seated on the floor in a certain posture, if you

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:55.840
start looking particular aspects of your body, your hands, your knees, your feet, your

01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:58.960
head, again, you can do it rightly, you can do it wrongly.

01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:05.120
If you do it rightly, you see those particular components being defined by the fact that

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:11.160
the body is generally already there, but at the same time, without those particular components,

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:16.240
that body couldn't have not there is any such in the first place.

01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:21.040
It's the same principle.

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.160
But if you just go at the components, forget about the whole picture, and just as this

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:31.160
is not mine, this is not mine, nothing will change really.

01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:42.720
Before I was missing the point, if I was thinking this body, this body, or what is this body

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:43.720
doing?

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:48.440
It's not that important thing, just I only have to keep seeing the feelings arise, as

01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:53.440
I thought, as a bubble in the mind, and just need to keep knowing that everything is

01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:58.880
appearing on their own, so situation works so well, but anyway, feelings are rising,

01:53:58.880 --> 01:53:59.880
wherever I am.

01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:05.600
Yeah, again, you can do that, but even then, you need a reference point in regard to what

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:06.600
you're looking at.

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:11.920
So, you might not want to be mindful of the body, that's fine, if you want to be mindful

01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:14.600
of the feelings, you need a reference point in regard to that.

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:20.600
In other words, there is always a situation that you have to be mindful of, there is always

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:25.360
more general and more particular, that's needed for mindfulness to be established.

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:31.200
You can't just be staring at the particular and being mindful, I am mindful, or rather

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.000
that mindfulness is not really established mindfulness.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:47.520
So, if you're mindful of your feelings arising, again, you can be anchored, established in

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:58.160
your situation, in terms of bodily posture, while I'm walking fear arose, while I'm walking

01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:05.920
fear is present, while I'm walking fear is present, while I'm walking fear is ceasing,

01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:16.040
while I'm walking fear is gone, as opposed to I'm afraid, I'm not afraid.

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:26.960
Oh, it's like the most subtle, you can get established in terms of mind object, thought,

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:27.960
dhamma.

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:35.960
That's another satipatana, whereby I'm feeling this on account of this memory, or on

01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:43.440
account of what somebody said, or on account of something I've seen.

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:50.360
For as long as that reason, I've seen something unpleasant, I feel bad.

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:55.320
For as long as this unpleasant thing is present, bad feeling endures.

01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:02.240
I'm pleasant feeling, unpleasant thing ceases, bad feeling is gone.

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:13.400
So, you see the feeling coming from that thing.

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:17.600
Not from you, belonging to that thing, not to you.

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:23.200
And again, you can see the fear belonging to the body in the situation, not to me, I'm

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.200
afraid.

01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:26.200
Because of the situation.

01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:27.200
Yeah.

01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:33.960
And that's how you abandon both, situation, and the particular thing that has a reason.

01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:36.120
Not because of me.

01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:43.120
Because if it comes from me, me will never be abandoned.

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:48.880
So, it's important to see that the relation, is it not enough support if I total forgot

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.880
about the situation with this body?

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:52.200
You can't forget about it.

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.000
You can ignore it, but it's already there.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:02.040
In the meditation support if I just keep seeing the bubbles arising in the circle.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:05.800
And just, whatever arises, everything actually arising on their own.

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:10.720
The only reason particular things that arise, can arise, is from the perspective of a more

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:14.240
general situation that it's already there.

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:22.000
In other words, the movement of arising and ceasing is impossible if there is no static

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.360
point in regard to it.

01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.280
That's just the nature of things.

01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.440
If everything is moving, there's no movement.

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:34.360
But the fact that you discern bubbles coming and going means there is a point that is

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:37.040
still in regard to that.

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:38.600
And that point is your situation.

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.480
That is more general than those particular changing bubbles.

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.280
So, you cannot, but not have it.

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:48.640
You can only ignore it.

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:49.640
And that's not good.

01:57:49.640 --> 01:58:01.440
Does that know that they can't go through a less tanky mildly or somewhat like that?

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:06.880
No, there's a part, yeah, yeah, well, with that, there is only doing meditation also.

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:12.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the whole thing, it's not like the A4 part and the A8 components

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:14.640
they need to be developed.

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:19.560
But it's not one, and then you develop two, and then you develop, in some of it is Sutta.

01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:26.280
The Sutta they talk about, the main Sutta, Majemika 9, he says that, with every of those

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:31.920
factors, it's governed by the first factor of the right view.

01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:35.600
So knowing things rightly, it's too fast to go through, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's get

01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:36.600
you to see.

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:37.600
No, sorry.

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:38.600
No, it's fine.

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:39.600
What's right?

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:43.960
Knowing things rightly, would make your meditation right, would make your reading the

01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:48.520
Sutta's right, would make your actions right, your seal of right, everything will become

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:51.880
right if you know that it's right.

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:53.760
So that's how it's done.

01:58:53.760 --> 01:59:00.800
So the thing is, people misunderstand meditation as a separate thing from contemplating the

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.920
dharma, but it's not.

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:09.800
One like meditation brings contemplation, contemplation brings meditation.

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:16.040
So if your meditation is not making any difference to your contemplation, that's a wrong meditation.

01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:22.280
And he said it's like two yokes pulling each other, and the two yokes, if one goes forward

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:24.920
what the other one will have, because they're connected.

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:29.400
So if you're putting forward some of that, the person that will be there, it's not like

01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:33.360
I'll do some of that here, then I'll go the other way and do a bit of a person there.

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:39.120
No, if you don't be a person, your meditation is coming with it, you can't even conceive

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.120
being separate.

01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:43.480
And if you read the Sutta's meditation, like Kanapana Sati, it's all this practice of

01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:44.480
this mindfulness.

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:49.800
And you got to more generally like, while I'm reading, I will feel this, while I'm reading

01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:53.400
I'll think that.

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:58.760
So being skilled in recognizing situation, you're inevitably, you can't even conceive

01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:06.760
not being in situation, because if you think I'm not in a situation, that is your situation.

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:11.880
And then you don't even have to constantly think about your situation, but in your daily

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:16.800
life, the fact that there are particular things, like, oh, I need to sweep this floor now

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:18.440
and clean this up.

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:22.920
It's only possible, because the floor in the cave and all the significance of the whole

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:28.160
thing is already present in my situation, and then I can attempt to these particular things.

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:31.200
I can't fool with the situation, or what does it mean?

02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:38.080
No, you can forget it, but you can't escape it, you forget it when you're not mindful.

02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:43.040
You ignore it, then you get caught up in particular things, and then you suffer more on the

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:48.920
particular things, or you get elated more on a kind of particular things.

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:53.160
In either way, you get moved much more by the particular things, you suffer.

02:00:53.160 --> 02:01:08.400
It's probably, I don't know, very new for you to hear this, but even if it's not, it's

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:09.400
not something.

02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:12.920
It's not something you can just hear somebody say once, and then you are.

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:18.320
You can get the idea, but you have to keep doing it, and like the nature of intention

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:24.720
works the same, like, because you had intention to come here today to see me and talk about

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:29.840
the Dunlain, that's a very general intention you had.

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:35.160
While that intention was still present, you went and hired a tuk-tuk, there was a more

02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:42.320
particular intention, calling the driver, telling him to come, giving him the time.

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:46.480
Walking to the tuk-tuk, sitting in the tuk-tuk, being in the tuk-tuk, coming here, walking,

02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:51.760
finding the place, getting lost, realizing that you were lost, finding the right way.

02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:57.280
All of those particular intentions were within the intention of you wanting to be here,

02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.800
talk tuk-tuk.

02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:05.480
If that general intention, you wanting to be here, tuk-tuk, disappears, but if you suddenly

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:10.600
change your mind on the way here, ooh, I can't go there today, that's it.

02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:11.600
You go back.

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:20.360
All of those particular intentions then lose their general, like, a significant direction.

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:24.280
You change your mind, suddenly I called and said I had to go to a hospital or something

02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:25.280
like that.

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:31.400
If the general intention of you wanting to be here, changes, whether through you or through

02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:35.440
the circumstances, all of the particular intentions, then go.

02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:38.880
I cannot go there, therefore, why would you be calling a tuk-tuk, telling him to bring

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:39.880
you here?

02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:40.880
No.

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:46.520
If you're about to make a phone call to call a driver, but then you find out if you

02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:50.720
can't come, you're not going to be doing this particular.

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:55.320
So that's how you can be mindful of all of those particular intentions by knowing what

02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.400
the general intention in regard to them.

02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:04.760
And obviously, there is no end to generality, nor there is an end to particularity.

02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.680
But that's not important.

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:12.280
You won't have to reach the end or the first point, because there won't be any.

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:15.720
The whole point is to understand that relationship.

02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:20.920
So if, sometimes, you had an intention to come here, but then your mindfulness is not

02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:22.520
established upon that intention.

02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:27.240
Well, then you can establish your mindfulness upon even more general intention of intention

02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:30.920
of you wanting to understand the dharma.

02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:34.880
As a result of you wanting to understand the dharma, you want to come here particularly

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:36.560
and talk about the dharma.

02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:39.600
As a result of you wanting to understand the dharma, you want to come here and talk the

02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:40.600
dharma.

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:44.040
You want to call the talk to driver and tell him to come at certain time and bring you

02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:45.040
here.

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:48.640
As a result of all of that, you will sit in the talk to for two and a half hours.

02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:53.640
As a result of that, you will be excellent and so on and so forth.

02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:58.520
So you can pick any of those things as long as you're mindful in regard to particular.

02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:02.440
Now just chase the particular or get lost in the general.

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.680
It's the relationship that's important.

02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:08.760
And that relationship is Sankara, Sankata dharma.

02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:11.200
The whole experience is dual in that sense.

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:12.200
Everything.

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.200
Everything experience falls into that.

02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:16.360
That's when you recall the fundamental structure.

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:20.280
It's the structure of the experience, the structure of the aggregates.

02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:24.680
And the Buddha said, even if somebody is remembering one previous life, five previous

02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:30.360
lives, five hundred previous lives, all they're remembering is these five or one among

02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:31.360
them.

02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:33.600
These five aggregates are one among them.

02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:34.600
Nothing.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:35.600
Nothing out of that.

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:36.600
It's all within.

02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:39.600
All within the same structure.

02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:46.120
The intention of this choosing, these things actually are really confusing because they

02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:49.600
have a sense of self, really, really, really, in intention.

02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.600
Yeah.

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:57.160
The closest, closest relation, like intention is that with the sense of service, but again,

02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:02.480
if you start looking in terms of the situation, the only reason you can intend to drink that

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:06.720
glass of water is because it's already there in your situation.

02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:13.840
So the particular intention, well, exactly, you can choose what's already given.

02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:18.400
If you haven't been given and displayed through your senses, you can't even conceive it,

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:22.040
let alone intend it.

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:27.240
But if you're just looking and focusing on the particular, then your intention will

02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:31.800
always feel very direct, always feel me and Aliya.

02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:35.440
Well, yeah, I want to drink water, but the only reason I can drink water is because there

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:39.920
is water here, drinkable water, and there is a little, and then you realize, even this

02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:45.640
whole sense of I want to do this is actually determined by that general situation, because

02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:50.640
if that thing changes, no matter how strong my sense of self is, if there is no water

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:55.280
to drink it here, that intention will not make sense, and I might have to go somewhere

02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:56.280
else.

02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:59.600
That's totally up here, you know, I don't know, I think it is.

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:05.240
Now, if you start looking through a situation, the relationship becomes more and more apparent,

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:11.320
the relationship that is mutually determining and kind of not requiring your sense of self

02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:14.640
at all.

02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:19.720
So the more you are aware of it, the more you discern it, less of it is yours.

02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:27.040
Externally, not much can change, not much needs to change, obviously, virtuous behavior

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:35.200
and so on, but that's it.
