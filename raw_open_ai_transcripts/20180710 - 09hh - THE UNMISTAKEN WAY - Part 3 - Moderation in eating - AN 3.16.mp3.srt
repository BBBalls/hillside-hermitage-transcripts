1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
I have to read this because it's a short one, and how it does have become observed

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,600
in moderation and eating.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,200
Here, reflecting carefully, the big group consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,080
nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,920
of this body, for avoiding harm and for assisting the spiritual life, considering, thus I shall

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,500
terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, and I shall be healthy and

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,320
blameless and throughout the ease.

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,960
It is in this way that a bigger observed moderation and eating, and this, again, is the practice

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:59,560
of the unmistakened way, which is the basic ground, for the destruction of the text.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:13,600
So, how does moderation and eating play part in this, play part in it?

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Exactly, but I was just saying, if you are transparent in regard to your motivation and intentions,

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,560
so you make sure they are not rooted in sensuality, hence you would basically be contributing

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,280
towards your sensory strength in general.

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,400
However, food is necessary, it's not something you can just stop eating and say no to it.

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,800
In the same sense, you can do that to a sexual intercourse or to other things, unnecessary

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,760
things of central nature.

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,480
So you have to eat food, but then food is also inseparable from the sense of taste, and

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,920
obviously has a whole wide range of pleasures that revolve around food for people, which

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,880
means it's quite likely going to be central, unless you make sure that your motivation is

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,760
rooted in clear reflection and basically clarifying and developing new reasons as to why

21
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,480
you are eating in the first place.

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,880
So that's why you keep reminding yourself, again, not out of some sort of neurosis or

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,880
something.

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,240
If you don't remind yourself of the alternative reasons for eating, you will automatically

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,480
be rooted in sensual reasons, enjoying the taste.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,520
But if you are rooted in proper reasons for eating, then no amount of refined central

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,800
taste can actually make it central, because you remain wakeful and clear and you don't

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,880
give in to any central intentions, for the duration of eating.

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,160
So you're not chasing your moses of food and observing your tongue and whatnot, you're

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
actually going the other way.

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,560
You're going the way of having your intention rooted for the purpose of filling up the belly

32
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,560
so I won't be hungry and will survive the next day.

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,320
So the moment your belly starts feeling full, because that's what you keep at the back

34
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,840
of your mind, you stop eating.

35
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,200
And then if there is any any any any response in terms of your thoughts wanting more and

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,800
stop them, that's obvious what it is, it's just craving, and you don't have to worry

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,160
about it because you haven't been engaging with it.

38
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Dispaling of hunger.

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,960
Yeah, that's the purpose of eating.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,600
But unless you keep that clear in your mind and often remind yourself, you will be

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
back onto the sensual reasons.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,920
So that's what we like you maintain, the transparency of your intentions, because when

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,640
you have intention to eat, for as long as you're eating, that same intention is present

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
there.

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,920
So you just want to make sure it doesn't shift into like onto different roots.

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,240
It doesn't sort of get moves away from the reasons of like intended reason of eating for

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,840
just dispelling hunger and moves away onto enjoying this particular taste.

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,640
So that's how you also mind remains above the taste, not through denying or not tasting

49
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,040
it, but simply through not giving in to last version delusion on account of it.

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:06,960
And no amount of lovely, nice, agreeable tastes could overwhelm the mind of the mind.

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,840
Some days you need to eat more.

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Exactly.

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,080
Some days you have to eat much more and your belly was still going full, feel like, well,

54
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
the hunger is gone.

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,920
So that's why there's no again, there's no method or technique or something of description

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,800
or recipe, eat this much every time though, you don't know.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
But that's not the point.

58
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,920
The food was never the problem, it was your desire and lust in regard to it.

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:38,000
So you start approaching that by not having those intentions of eating rooted in that

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
sensuality, but other reasons for it.

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
Because you can't go either way, like you cannot, you cannot have like a sexual intercourse

62
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,880
for example rooted in all some reasons, that's just too obvious.

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,240
But things like eating food and drinking, yeah, they can go either way, they can be wholesome

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
or unwholesome.

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Drinking water.

66
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,320
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

67
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
that's not negotiable, yeah.

68
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,120
I mean drinking water or whatever, I don't know, fruit juice or tea or coffee or things

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
like that.

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Yeah.

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,120
And what about fasting?

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,680
Well, again, if done for right reasons, it can make this whole picture and relationship

73
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,320
between the last founded upon sensuality or, sorry, intentions founded upon last sensuality

74
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,200
or nonlast, non-sensuality, it can make that whole relationship clear.

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,960
But if you do, if you just fast mechanically, if you took it as some external determination,

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,360
no wisdom arise from it.

77
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,480
That's where self-mortification won't arise, won't reveal the middle way in terms of

78
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,240
you won't lead to liberation, nor indulge as well.

79
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,560
That's why the Buddha would say, let those who want to go and live on one meal and sit

80
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,760
under the root of a tree do it, let those who don't want to, wanting and don't want

81
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,040
to means knowing whether it's good for you or not, doesn't mean like, oh, great, so

82
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,280
I don't need to go out.

83
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Well, maybe you should actually.

84
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,280
See, let those with divine view, those in different ways.

85
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,800
Pretty much, let those who know what makes their non-existent lust, what prevents non-existent

86
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,720
lust from manifesting, and what makes the existence lust disappearing.

87
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Let those either go on the root of sure not, or eat one meal a day, or separate it, or

88
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:49,360
separate it out to you.
