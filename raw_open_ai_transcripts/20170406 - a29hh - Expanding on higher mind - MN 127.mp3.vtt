WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
So this Anurandha Sutra, which I said is asking what is the exalted deliverance of mind

00:16.000 --> 00:23.280
and what is the immeasurable deliverance of mind, and the exalted hieropic abides resolved

00:23.280 --> 00:28.360
upon an area the size of root of one tree, pervading it as exalted, this is called an exalted

00:28.360 --> 00:35.480
deliverance of mind, and then it goes on further two, three trees, a size of a village,

00:35.480 --> 00:40.200
it's a point being, even that the smaller it has a root of a tree, basically you start

00:40.200 --> 00:46.880
exalting your mind literally on the phenomena that's larger than your body, that it's present

00:46.880 --> 00:52.160
at here right now, larger than your body but related to your body, not just through your

00:52.160 --> 00:58.240
body being seated, the root of the tree but also being composed of the four great elements.

00:58.240 --> 01:05.160
So it's enough, you don't have to exalt your mind to the casinos of earth and so on,

01:05.160 --> 01:13.240
but it's enough just a room, just a floor that's wider than you, so it's a goody, goody

01:13.240 --> 01:18.040
because again if you make it personal, if you see that that goody is composed of four

01:18.040 --> 01:25.280
great elements that compose this very body because of which you can think, feel, intend,

01:25.280 --> 01:31.440
decide, just do anything but because of which you exist really, and you recognize, yeah,

01:31.440 --> 01:39.200
the quicky of the root of the tree, it will come to destruction, it will come to defamation,

01:39.200 --> 01:44.520
what is to be said for this body that's inferior to that, that's going to happen even soon

01:44.520 --> 01:49.560
even quicker, so just the knowledge of that, you don't have to then destroy the tree to

01:49.560 --> 01:55.760
prove it yourself or destroy this body, to prove it yourself, which would be a contradiction,

01:55.760 --> 02:00.360
but just the knowledge that it's a subject to destruction that pertains to you, to your

02:00.360 --> 02:04.320
body, to your center, to the center of your world, which is this physical body, it's

02:04.320 --> 02:10.560
enough for dispassion and for not regarding that body is yours, not taking it up, not

02:10.560 --> 02:22.360
appropriating it, it's also kind of, it's also kind of training to enlarge it in the

02:22.360 --> 02:23.360
mind.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.520
Yeah, the establishment on a great phenomenon, but I've seen two things at once, but for

02:28.520 --> 02:31.120
the establishment is, it doesn't mean you just start thinking about the roots of the

02:31.120 --> 02:39.040
trees or villages, means there has to be that dependence established, that connection

02:39.040 --> 02:45.080
between the presence of the phenomenon of the greater kind, in relation to the phenomenon

02:45.080 --> 02:50.680
of this body right here, right now, so it's not just enough to think about mountains and

02:50.680 --> 02:54.320
elements or whatever else, you need to think in relation to this body, and what is the

02:54.320 --> 03:00.000
relation, it's the simultaneous presence of these very four great elements that are

03:00.000 --> 03:03.960
comprising all these mountains, all these trees, this whole quality of the tree, including

03:03.960 --> 03:11.080
these body, these senses, these fresh elements, because of which I am, which I think I am.

03:11.080 --> 03:18.640
So all of that, my whole world can be swept away, and it is undermined through a simple

03:18.640 --> 03:25.480
possibility of being swept away, by these great elements, by the matter that's out of

03:25.480 --> 03:31.120
your control, because if that changes, if that decides, if your heart decides to stop,

03:31.120 --> 03:36.000
or whatever reason, you don't know what's floating on your veins, you might block it, just,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.360
like there you go, I mean even these things that pertain to your body would be enough

03:41.360 --> 03:46.720
to recognize that you have absolutely no say in the operation of your organs and the

03:46.720 --> 03:52.800
fleshy senses, sense organ, because yet your whole world is known as your world because

03:52.800 --> 04:00.120
of that, so when they go, your world cannot remain, not even for a second.

04:00.120 --> 04:09.600
But yeah, you can establish your mind with those greater things, so me walking in the

04:09.600 --> 04:17.160
village, me in the village, by the mountains, and so on, and have that mountain range as

04:17.160 --> 04:20.600
my, as far as my life is going.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.600
Yes, yes.

04:21.600 --> 04:27.440
Wow, I'm not losing something, my body, my situation, yeah.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.440
It's within that.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.120
It's simultaneously present within that.

04:31.120 --> 04:35.920
That's the whole point, so it's not one and two, it's like one within one.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.120
But do I have to think about that?

04:38.120 --> 04:39.520
No, no, that's the thing.

04:39.520 --> 04:44.280
Well, you have to think about it when the mind is not established upon it, when the mind

04:44.280 --> 04:50.080
gets established upon it, because it's true, your body is within that, which means through

04:50.080 --> 04:56.760
your body you can see that, so then your body, the presence of the elements of your body,

04:56.760 --> 05:01.760
keep your mind established upon the greater phenomenon of those elements, which is the

05:01.760 --> 05:06.680
mountain, which is the mountain range, which is the, or, or the other sort of the perceptions

05:06.680 --> 05:13.280
of the forest, your mind is established in a, cause forest is created in the little village,

05:13.280 --> 05:17.080
so your mind is established upon the perceptions of the forest, so when you go in the village,

05:17.080 --> 05:30.040
nothing can be such a day, but as I said, it needs to be made personal, it's not, it's

05:30.040 --> 05:35.520
not an abstract pondering on, you know, the composition of the rocks of the mountain

05:35.520 --> 05:40.360
range or something, it's basically seeing your body within that and seeing that through

05:40.360 --> 05:45.920
your body.

05:45.920 --> 05:50.040
So in the same sense, on top of the mountain range, there are trees being, being swung

05:50.040 --> 05:56.800
by the wind, there's the rolling rocks, there are, I don't know, crumbling dust of, of

05:56.800 --> 06:02.200
soil or whatever else, on a more particular level, there are elements, yeah, your nails are

06:02.200 --> 06:06.320
growing, your body is moving around, you're sweating, you're very rising the water in the

06:06.320 --> 06:07.320
river.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.960
Rising the water over the river, yeah, passing the water out from your body, just, it

06:11.960 --> 06:19.200
is, is the elements moving, so you start seeing your body as pertaining to that, that will

06:19.200 --> 06:30.520
result eventually in you not regarding your body as pertaining to you.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.920
Because I was, I wasn't when you're going into that composition, that kind of composition,

06:34.920 --> 06:44.040
I was more just expanding the mind, my body there surrounded within this, you know, as far

06:44.040 --> 06:45.040
as being.

06:45.040 --> 06:51.080
But the point is to learn how to keep seeing it within your body, so when you're moving

06:51.080 --> 06:55.080
as that sort of says, when you establish the mind upon the perception of the forest, when

06:55.080 --> 06:58.960
you go into the village and you see sites, you see things that were usually provoked,

06:58.960 --> 07:04.240
lost or anger or so on, you wouldn't, because the mind remains established upon the perceptions

07:04.240 --> 07:06.040
of the forest.

07:06.040 --> 07:11.040
So you don't want to have to, just, oh, I must sit motionless, cross like for three hours

07:11.040 --> 07:15.360
to practice this, you might start like that without distractions, but the point of that

07:15.360 --> 07:22.760
establishment is to disregard your body regardless of the posture, regardless of its activity.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.560
Not just to have the establishment when you're seated in motionless, because I wouldn't

07:25.560 --> 07:28.320
be really an establishment.

07:28.320 --> 07:33.200
So when your body is seated, lying down, standing up or walking, the mind remains established

07:33.200 --> 07:39.840
upon the great phenomena, that's basically your body within that already.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.840
So that's the thing.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.280
It's the discernment that your body's already within that.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.760
You don't need to fabricate anything.

07:44.760 --> 07:51.440
You just have to discern it right away, because it is already there.

07:51.440 --> 07:59.960
There's the actual shooter after that.

07:59.960 --> 08:09.240
There it is, and the good is questioning, I'm a rudder, and he says, how do you abide

08:09.240 --> 08:10.240
in meditation?

08:10.240 --> 08:16.120
He says, vulnerable, so as we abide here, diligent, hard and resolute, we perceive

08:16.120 --> 08:21.000
both light and a vision of form.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.800
Soon after, it was the light and the vision of form to disappear, but we have not discovered

08:24.800 --> 08:28.280
the cause for that.

08:28.280 --> 08:37.640
Yeah, well, I remember that in this, and there are lots of notes on Pali, so that translation

08:37.640 --> 08:45.440
to read it out now, he has quite a good chance of being very subjective.

08:45.440 --> 08:52.320
So you have to get a few different translations, the extra Pali as well, and then work on it.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.320
But go on, read the whole thing, let's see.

08:56.320 --> 09:09.120
You should discover the rules for that, and he says, before my enlightenment, while I

09:09.120 --> 09:17.760
was still only enlightened, I too perceive both light and a vision of forms.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.200
Soon after, the light and the vision of forms disappeared, I thought, what is the cause

09:22.200 --> 09:26.680
and condition why the light and the vision of forms have disappeared, and I considered

09:26.680 --> 09:31.200
those doubts of those in me, and because of their doubts, my concentration fell away,

09:31.200 --> 09:37.560
and my concentration fell away, my composure fell away, and the light and vision of form

09:37.560 --> 09:38.560
disappeared.

09:38.560 --> 09:49.280
I shall so that I shall so that their doubts will not arise in me again.

09:49.280 --> 10:00.120
And then sometimes, as he sees, as he just light and just forms both, you know, I was

10:00.120 --> 10:03.120
just wondering about the whole light and forms.

10:03.120 --> 10:15.600
Well, what is the part of it, because I mean, you know, he was translating, well, is it

10:15.600 --> 10:20.560
a non-indicative consciousness, that consciousness doesn't indicate anything, he was translating

10:20.560 --> 10:25.920
consciousness, that it's luminous all around, and what does that mean?

10:25.920 --> 10:29.840
So when he comes to these things, light and vision of forms, and I think there might

10:29.840 --> 10:34.800
be different connotations that could probably make more sense.

10:34.800 --> 10:41.640
So that's why I say, you get a little part of it, because it seems that you can see

10:41.640 --> 10:45.560
the separation, you can see forms, you can see light.

10:45.560 --> 10:59.560
So in a way, yes, because any form of manifestation of phenomena, even as a thought, requires

10:59.560 --> 11:05.960
it's, well, it's rising, it's manifestation, which means there is a degree of light in

11:05.960 --> 11:11.400
regard to it, because if there is no degree of light in regard to it, it just would not

11:11.400 --> 11:18.320
be discerned against the nothingness, it can't basically normalize it.

11:18.320 --> 11:24.840
So even if you think about, I don't know, something like, like fleeting movements, just

11:24.840 --> 11:29.760
make movements, just nothing particular that I've thought, that ponder on the nature,

11:29.760 --> 11:36.360
even that is discerned to an extent, to a very ambiguous extent, obviously, it's not

11:36.360 --> 11:39.360
clearly defined as the object of the senses.

11:39.360 --> 11:43.200
So as I said before, no matter how remote these thoughts are, they are valid phenomena.

11:43.200 --> 11:48.720
And it's such, they have a reason, which means there is a degree of light in that.

11:48.720 --> 11:53.640
So that's, like if your mind were to be established upon the degree of light in regard

11:53.640 --> 11:58.800
to anything and everything that arises, means you'd be established in regard to everything

11:58.800 --> 12:06.880
and anything that arises, very similarly, the Buddha did say, the ultimate, the highest

12:06.880 --> 12:13.000
of the all casinos is casinos consciousness, which is casinos unknown, not arising in

12:13.000 --> 12:18.280
regard to the arising, it's because of that, so it's because of it that arising is possible

12:18.280 --> 12:21.800
to be discerned.

12:21.800 --> 12:28.640
So consciousness is the ultimate negative, it doesn't appear, because you're always conscious

12:28.640 --> 12:34.760
of, or other things that are conscious of, that's what I mean when I say consciousness

12:34.760 --> 12:40.240
is out there with a form, I mean, I don't mean it's actually the light that form, it's

12:40.240 --> 12:45.080
a completely separate, a different thing, but it's out there paired with a form on the

12:45.080 --> 12:51.800
same, well on the same level that it's below your feet, you can't even conceal, entering

12:51.800 --> 12:57.840
it, or even thinking about it, because whatever you think, you're already conscious of, that's

12:57.840 --> 13:03.160
what you're able to think of, which means consciousness and the matter in regard to

13:03.160 --> 13:17.880
it are kind of prerequisite, so even if you say, I say, okay, think about darkness, there's

13:17.880 --> 13:23.160
an element of light in regard to that, that's what I'm thinking of, yes, there's very

13:23.160 --> 13:28.680
kind of, yes, that's very subtle, but imagine your mind gets, and yes, imagine, because

13:28.680 --> 13:33.360
through imagination, along the right lines, you will start getting clear picture, which

13:33.360 --> 13:39.040
means you will be able, well, means your thoughts will be less and less of an abstraction,

13:39.040 --> 13:47.400
as we spoke before, and will become more valid representations of what it actually is,

13:47.400 --> 13:54.400
and that's how this seminar happens, so if the mind, as I said, imagine, if the mind

13:54.400 --> 14:06.400
is composed to such extent, the discernment of light in regard to things that are manifested,

14:06.400 --> 14:18.000
that are enduring already manifested, you sum out anything that arises, because in a way

14:18.000 --> 14:27.480
that all of that is because of that light in regard to it, but then obviously, the light

14:27.480 --> 14:32.800
in regard to it will not be discerned if there is nothing that is like shining up, so

14:32.800 --> 14:37.600
to speak, or you know, I don't like that, coming because it implies the direction, usually

14:37.600 --> 14:42.480
people think I'm shining the light, no, let's say like this, the light will not be discerned

14:42.480 --> 14:50.640
because the things that arise, well, will not reveal, and as you will know, they like,

14:50.640 --> 14:54.880
so there is no light with other things, so you don't start assuming that the light is

14:54.880 --> 15:02.480
eternal and things are just being revealed by this massive torch, no, light is to the

15:02.480 --> 15:08.000
extent of the things arising, but it's not the things arising, but it actually belongs

15:08.000 --> 15:12.560
to things more than it belongs to you, or are it completely belongs to things, in the

15:12.560 --> 15:17.440
same sense that matter is paired with consciousness, not you, you're not paired with consciousness,

15:17.440 --> 15:23.440
you don't have consciousness, matter is paired with it, external, in that like the nature

15:23.440 --> 15:29.920
of juxtaposition, so it's not, it's not even that the matter is conscious, or consciousness

15:29.920 --> 15:35.600
possesses matter, no, it's just matter, consciousness, two entirely separate entities, they're the

15:35.600 --> 15:42.000
juxtaposed together, as a result of that juxtaposition, you have your whole life, your whole

15:42.000 --> 15:46.400
experience, so everything, and that's when they're always below your feet, that juxtaposition,

15:46.400 --> 15:52.720
that's the ratio between matter and consciousness, he's just, well, you can't even think it,

15:52.720 --> 16:06.640
accurately, or rather, the only way to think it accurately is to stop assuming it entirely,

16:09.760 --> 16:13.680
you're saying about, talk about movement, intention, movement,

16:13.680 --> 16:25.760
not, because another word for intention, pretty much, it's a light movement, because everything

16:26.960 --> 16:38.160
has a movement, there's movement, individuality, there's a set, just, even the nature of duration,

16:38.160 --> 16:45.600
like something is taking time, something is enduring in time, that's already a form of movement,

16:46.400 --> 16:51.760
and such that movement is a nature of intention, that is what intention is, movement,

16:52.560 --> 16:56.400
that's where it's the most easiest to appropriate, to move,

16:57.360 --> 17:02.560
and also the stance for the sense of control, you know, you are, you are moving it,

17:02.560 --> 17:09.440
planning it, applying it, withdrawing it, moving, oh, I am doing this, but the movement,

17:10.720 --> 17:15.520
in itself, it's a phenomenon that's indifferent to you, there would be a way without you,

17:15.520 --> 17:20.960
so you're like, oh, I can't even control that, even my own intentions, the nature of those intentions

17:20.960 --> 17:33.920
cannot be my own, that's the easiest to appropriate, the easiest to take, because in the way

17:33.920 --> 17:42.080
the movement is also negative in regard to things that move, so you have solid objects,

17:42.080 --> 17:47.360
immuable objects, so it's big, that then they move, as we spoke before, you throw a cup,

17:47.360 --> 17:54.960
the movement, it's not the cup, obviously, but then there wouldn't be a movement of the cup,

17:54.960 --> 18:01.280
if there is no discernible phenomenon of a solid immuable cup, and when I say immuable,

18:01.280 --> 18:05.520
I mean immuable in itself, not immuable as a whole, that you can move from point A to point B,

18:05.520 --> 18:11.920
so the nature of the movement, it's not the things that move, movement is not things that move,

18:11.920 --> 18:20.800
but then there would be no movement if there's nothing to be moved, so the movement depends on

18:20.800 --> 18:25.840
things that can move, and things that can move, well, they're determined as things,

18:25.840 --> 18:28.160
they're determined in the movement, because they can move,

18:28.160 --> 18:38.560
because if the cup suddenly starts moving, it melts away, it ceases to be the cup,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.560
but then obviously now you have this melted steel of this metal cup,

18:47.280 --> 18:52.160
well now that becomes a thing, it's kind of a bit more movable, but even that movement in

18:52.160 --> 18:59.200
regard to the matter of that thing, the matter is not movement, but there wouldn't be no movement,

18:59.200 --> 19:10.640
it has no matter, just in concealer, so basically the planes of movement, the possibility of movement,

19:11.840 --> 19:17.520
is already given to you beforehand, by that relationship, by that external relationship of

19:17.520 --> 19:23.680
matter and consciousness, that's how you disown the movement as well, the most personal

19:23.680 --> 19:32.800
of the intention choices, intentional intentions, attention, that's like the primary movement you do,

19:32.800 --> 19:38.320
you attend this one account of that, you move from that to this, you choose to stay with that,

19:38.320 --> 19:43.440
which means you keep moving back to that, so that thing is enduring because it holds your interest,

19:43.440 --> 19:49.840
and you know when people's minds are all over the place, when they can't keep the attention,

19:49.840 --> 19:54.960
it's just the movement, it's just so weak, the mind is just flying everywhere, and they're

19:54.960 --> 20:00.080
moved with it, but even that possibility of the movement, it's possible only because there is

20:00.080 --> 20:05.920
matter, that's very consciousness out there, external to you, so the planes of the movement,

20:05.920 --> 20:11.920
that the space, the element of space, is already revealed to you as a result of that external

20:11.920 --> 20:19.840
relationship, two movements are bounded within that space, well yeah, yeah, of course, yeah,

20:19.840 --> 20:29.760
exactly, yeah, that's why space, although it's not like the fundamental element in terms of

20:29.760 --> 20:33.440
the four great elements, is sometimes realistic, because you know there's like four great elements,

20:33.440 --> 20:40.240
and then it's listed as earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness, so the six elements,

20:40.240 --> 20:44.080
and that's what I'm talking about when I say the external relationship, the external relationship

20:44.080 --> 20:50.960
or the earth, water, fire, air, jacks supposed to be consciousness, results, or rather generates

20:50.960 --> 20:56.000
the phenomenon of space within which movement is possible, so the mind gets established upon

20:56.000 --> 21:06.560
the phenomenon of space, means nothing that moves within that space can be appropriate, because

21:06.560 --> 21:11.600
you're established upon the greater phenomena within which these things occur, in the same

21:11.600 --> 21:16.960
sense as we spoke before, you establish upon the phenomena of these great mountains you live on,

21:16.960 --> 21:19.680
and then whatever happens to it within the presence of the mountains,

21:22.320 --> 21:29.920
so any sorrow, grief, joy, elation pertains to this tiny, literally significant body within

21:29.920 --> 21:39.120
this great notion of space, valid notion of space, not kind of sort of projected mystical

21:39.840 --> 21:44.560
whatever else, spaciousness, I don't want to call it not, the notion of space, there is present

21:44.560 --> 21:53.280
within which this movement is possible, movement reveals the space, things in space move,

21:53.280 --> 22:01.920
so movement in regards to things basically it's what intention is, hence things are intentional,

22:02.880 --> 22:13.040
things move, possibilities, that's already form movement, thoughts basically, possibilities are

22:13.040 --> 22:21.840
the same as thoughts, you have a cup, you can use it to drink from it, and the mind, that's already

22:21.840 --> 22:27.280
mind, that's already made a movement, now if you decide to use it for drinking, then you made a

22:27.280 --> 22:32.880
movement on top of the movement, but even the still possibility of a cup to be drunk from,

22:32.880 --> 22:35.760
then already implies the direction that now can be followed,

22:41.360 --> 22:45.920
and there's nothing to do with it, there's everything to do with the cup as a reason phenomena,

22:45.920 --> 22:54.080
and that's why you can intend to follow what has been given as a possibility,

23:02.080 --> 23:08.080
so to watch, movement, to watch, if you, if you start to shaman upon the nature of the movement,

23:08.960 --> 23:13.600
that won't be movement, which means you won't be affected by anything that moves, and that's pretty much

23:13.600 --> 23:21.760
everything, hence the, the, the, the, the scenery, the, the metaphor of, of immovable,

23:24.080 --> 23:29.600
here you got to tell it, because you're surrounded in the nature of movement, and what is nature to move,

23:30.240 --> 23:35.280
form as a nature to move, feeling as nature to move, perception as a nature to move, intentions,

23:35.280 --> 23:38.720
some, determinations, some kind of as a nature to move, consciousness as a nature to move,

23:38.720 --> 23:48.000
there's anything that appears, exactly, anything that no matter how vaguely, how remotely, how

23:48.000 --> 23:55.440
beautifully marked appear, to that extent it moves, because as I said, even just pure,

23:55.440 --> 24:00.800
you know, like almost arising, ceasing, resisting, while changing, enduring, that's already movement,

24:00.800 --> 24:13.280
that motion of time is a movement, the nature of movement, everything, your thoughts,

24:13.280 --> 24:21.200
your feelings, your intentions, your perceptions, by arising, by ceasing, by resisting,

24:21.200 --> 24:31.280
watching, enduring, that's already movement, that's movement, mind gets established upon the nature of movement,

24:32.640 --> 24:37.600
nothing that the picture of the moves will be able to affect you, because movement is there,

24:37.600 --> 24:42.880
but again, you know, that establishing mind upon that, that movement needs to be taken personal,

24:43.680 --> 24:49.920
needs to be pertaining to that which you take to be yourself, needs to be determined, needs to be

24:49.920 --> 24:55.920
bound by, so then by disowning the movement, then you will be unable to hold this thing to be yours,

25:03.680 --> 25:11.280
perception, feeling, you describe, you describe the feelings, you can feel it, feeling, and that's

25:11.280 --> 25:19.440
movement here, which is what your intention is, feelings move, yeah, well, your intention is to feel it moves,

25:19.440 --> 25:26.240
yeah, feelings, feelings, feelings, yeah, then you, they persist there, there's movement in this

25:26.240 --> 25:31.600
and there, more general movement, but obviously the most particular movement, the one that's

25:33.280 --> 25:39.200
attention is the most immediate movement, while you're attending, while you're choosing to keep

25:39.200 --> 25:46.720
attending, because by choosing to attend something, you always have to attend on expense of something

25:46.720 --> 25:56.640
else, then even if your mind is moving around, jumping around, you can be quite established because

25:57.520 --> 26:01.600
if your intention is to, yeah, because you are not being moved by the champion mind,

26:01.600 --> 26:06.720
yeah, because you're paying, can you pay attention to the attention, well, you can't be attending

26:06.720 --> 26:12.960
your attention, but you can certainly discern the roots of your attention, so your attention has

26:12.960 --> 26:18.640
to direct itself at something, but it doesn't mean that your whole vision has to be taken with that

26:20.080 --> 26:26.320
100%, so in other words, by attending something, you can remain aware of the background of that

26:26.320 --> 26:30.240
attention that's attending this particular thing, and that's nothing than developing your

26:30.240 --> 26:36.960
own insomanasica, nothing, that's exactly the thing, the root, the boom of your attention,

26:36.960 --> 26:47.280
where the attention comes from, so to speak, so by remaining mindful, establish

26:48.480 --> 26:53.360
discerning the background in regard to that which is being attended to,

26:53.360 --> 27:06.320
you're getting the picture of the whole direction, the whole direction of the movement,

27:08.880 --> 27:15.120
and by dwelling, rather by discerning sufficiently enough, the whole direction of the movement,

27:16.240 --> 27:19.760
you realize that there is no room for your sense of self in that movement,

27:19.760 --> 27:28.720
it's only because movement, it's easy to ignore, that movement becomes my movement, the movement

27:28.720 --> 27:37.120
of me, the symbol that stands for my sense of control, for my appropriation, because it moves,

27:37.120 --> 27:43.040
that's why it's easy to ignore, not see, that's why a Vigia Patria sankara,

27:43.040 --> 27:51.200
through that ignoring, that movement becomes the determination of self.

27:58.080 --> 28:06.000
It's one thing I always, not a Vigia, says, mentioned on that. Intentions may be regarded

28:06.000 --> 28:15.120
basically as the relation between actual and possible, relationship between actual and possible,

28:16.480 --> 28:24.720
in what we're just talking about now, how it is, you said the movement is, one moment

28:26.160 --> 28:29.040
is determined by the possibility of things to be moved,

28:29.040 --> 28:42.720
hence Nenevira was also talking about space, not there specifically, but talking about the

28:42.720 --> 28:50.400
intentions, is the presence of intention that basically correlates to the notion of space and

28:50.400 --> 28:58.720
the three dimensions, but that's what unnecessarily detail really, the point is it, it ties in with what

28:58.720 --> 29:09.680
you just read, as I said, possibility of, and a reason thing, I know that thing, so they're

29:09.680 --> 29:14.320
possible and there isn't things actual, but the possibilities are the directions that you can move

29:14.320 --> 29:22.720
that thing towards, and by thinking the possibilities, you're already moving, hence the movement,

29:22.720 --> 29:29.440
the, sorry, the thoughts, the intentions towards those possibilities are determined by possible

29:29.440 --> 29:44.400
and the actual, actual. It says the immeasurable deliverance of mind, what is, what is that? Yeah,

29:44.400 --> 29:50.160
big goodbye to pervading one quarter of the mind of Nenevira's loving kindness, like was a second,

29:50.160 --> 30:02.480
like was a third, fourth, below or around the number where, has to always to himself. So he

30:02.480 --> 30:13.520
establishes mind, his mind, instead of saying in a matter of kindness, he could establish his

30:13.520 --> 30:27.120
mind on non-yelwill, or non-melons, or is he compassion on cruelty or something. So I think

30:27.120 --> 30:31.680
we spoke about it before, and yeah, that's probably why you're mentioning it, like non-yelwill

30:31.680 --> 30:35.840
is greater than your will, because your will is always in regard to particular things. So,

30:35.840 --> 30:44.960
if he says, yeah, you can't afford my eyes, loving kindness, compassion, altruistic joy,

30:46.560 --> 30:53.200
and equanimity, and it says, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, and always says, without hostility

30:53.200 --> 30:57.440
and without ill will, your mind is a blind, loving kindness,

30:57.440 --> 31:03.520
that can't he just abide with the mind of non-yelwill,

31:03.520 --> 31:12.720
that is the mind of loving kindness, so that he doesn't generate a mind of kindness.

31:12.720 --> 31:20.720
Not intentionally, as people think you should do it, it's generated indirectly through establishing

31:20.720 --> 31:27.040
your mind in non-hostility and non-yelwill, if you establish yourself long enough for a sufficient

31:27.040 --> 31:32.080
degree, in that result, that experience, what you'll experience in the time is the experience of

31:32.080 --> 31:39.600
loving kindness. Between the experience of loving kindness is determined by your establishment

31:39.600 --> 31:46.560
upon non-hostility and non-yelwill. That's why you can't appropriate, that's why the Buddha did

31:46.560 --> 31:51.520
praise Bramuri Haras, and they can lead you to our own chip and full destruction of the fetus,

31:51.520 --> 31:57.280
because inasmuch like Janus, you can't appropriate, you can't I am feeling matter,

31:57.280 --> 32:01.120
because there wouldn't be matter, if there is a sense of self in regard to it.

32:01.120 --> 32:06.480
But if your sense of self is concerned about non-hostility and non-yelwill and sticks to that,

32:06.480 --> 32:11.680
then eventually becomes redundant, and the result of that is the experience of loving kindness,

32:11.680 --> 32:18.720
and then you can you can intend it, you can whatever, build, build on top of that, go further,

32:18.720 --> 32:26.640
and it all eventually results in economity, immoral, but you don't do that, you don't,

32:27.120 --> 32:31.680
and that's why, yeah, that's why it's quite, well, it's quite dangerous in a way,

32:31.680 --> 32:35.520
because people read for Bramuri Haras, and you think, oh nah, I just had to start thinking positive,

32:35.520 --> 32:39.200
it's all too good, thoughts, people, relationships. That's fine, you can think that, but don't

32:39.200 --> 32:43.280
think that that is the practice of Bramuri Haras, because then you will never make the effort to

32:43.280 --> 32:48.240
find out what an extra practice of Bramuri Haras really is, and you can know that whatever you're doing,

32:48.240 --> 32:53.040
you're not the practice of Bramuri Haras, because you're not an arahant, because if you were to do it,

32:54.160 --> 32:58.080
not even then long, it could result, it could result to the correctly, you would result

32:58.080 --> 33:03.520
destruction of all fetters, because it undermines the very framework of the sense of self,

33:03.520 --> 33:08.720
in regard to me, in regard to others, in regard to both, in regard to neither.

33:10.160 --> 33:15.360
There is no room for self in them, in the same sense, there's no room for self in Janus,

33:15.360 --> 33:20.240
which is why Bramuri Haras can also be used to then establish a mind into a genre upon them,

33:21.040 --> 33:22.880
depending on how you start attending to sticks.

33:29.520 --> 33:34.240
So you abide without his mind, without hostility, without your will.

33:35.440 --> 33:41.360
And as you've seen, your will is not your will, is a greater phenomenon.

33:41.360 --> 33:46.000
Yeah, your will is much smaller, much more particular.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.680
Well, it means in particular, you can't have your will in the general manner,

33:50.240 --> 33:55.360
because even then, if you're like generally bad mood, well, that becomes a particular thing.

33:55.360 --> 34:00.400
So your will is always directional, because of that, no new will is always greater,

34:01.200 --> 34:02.400
it's always the basis of it.

34:02.400 --> 34:14.240
So if someone was abiding most of the time, not your will, or attending to that phenomenon,

34:16.560 --> 34:21.440
and they get angry, but I can't really get angry that much.

34:23.440 --> 34:27.680
No, the displeasing, the disagreeable circumstances, if their mind is established,

34:27.680 --> 34:32.640
if they'd well often, as they would have said, you should well often in these states,

34:33.440 --> 34:34.560
then they will kind of rise.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.800
It's basically like heating the pan.

34:37.600 --> 34:41.280
If the pan is just mildly warm, when you throw the water, well the water will linger.

34:41.840 --> 34:46.560
But imagine you keep warming up that pan for quite some time, and it's red hot.

34:47.280 --> 34:52.560
No matter how much water you check on it, it will just pshh, you'll need to evaporate, go.

34:52.560 --> 35:00.880
So put the lingerer up, but then you know, you get careless, the fire drops down,

35:02.000 --> 35:06.800
cools down, then even the tiny drop of water will linger a long time, if it's a cold pan.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.600
That's the same with the mind.

35:10.880 --> 35:17.120
If the mind doesn't dwell upon the notions, the abstractions of non-year will,

35:17.120 --> 35:22.720
just think abstractly, what it is to have non-melos and non-hostility.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.480
Dwell on that long enough.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.880
Don't actively try to love people or anything like that.

35:28.880 --> 35:31.760
That's already the particularizing of that thing, which is a mistake.

35:33.280 --> 35:38.640
The result of non-hostility and non-year will be a genuine loving kindness.

35:38.640 --> 35:44.160
A loving kindness that doesn't induce the sense of self, that doesn't induce the sense of

35:44.160 --> 35:50.960
conceit. Loving kindness is just pure framework of me and others, neither of us can really own

35:50.960 --> 35:55.120
what we think we own. Thus you just have loving kindness. Compassion.

35:57.360 --> 36:02.400
Compassion to the kind of indifferent framework of your experience as it is.

36:04.240 --> 36:09.920
But you can't, or other, you can get that directly through this indirect practice,

36:09.920 --> 36:14.000
which is in a way, in itself, on its own.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.240
It's a direct way, so to speak.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.920
But it's not a direct way from what people think, it's a direct way.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.320
I am spreading beams of loving kindness.

36:22.320 --> 36:26.640
As I'm going to point it out, so if you're radiating beams of loving kindness,

36:27.760 --> 36:31.200
what would you do when it comes to a pecker?

36:31.200 --> 36:34.160
How can you radiate beams of indifference? How does that work?

36:34.960 --> 36:37.920
I'm sending you the beams of my econymity.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.600
I'm moving these beams towards you of this immobility.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.280
It's just nonsense.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.840
Yeah, it was always a painful practice.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.360
Contrary, it's a very controlled practice.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.920
It doesn't hear you in an eloquent way.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.640
Of course, you know, it's very eloquent, if it's unrightly.

37:04.640 --> 37:08.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, almost f, because that's the effortless.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.200
It's because it's not over yet, not over yet.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.680
Because all I have to do is pay attention and make sure

37:16.320 --> 37:18.640
non-illwill, non-hostility prevails.

37:20.480 --> 37:24.080
So all I have to do is guard the gates, so to speak.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.520
And the more 45-year gates are, the less things will be going through of your will and hostility.

37:31.520 --> 37:36.960
And when that becomes a state you abide in, often enough, that's your bravavigada.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.160
3-0 is meta.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.400
Mudita, Karuna, and then just complete immobility in regard to order.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.520
Yeah, equanimity.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.280
Because meta-mudita, Karuna, are the subtle movements.

37:56.880 --> 37:58.640
But they are so subtle, so neutral.

37:58.640 --> 38:03.600
And then you can be based for the full destruction of fetters.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.720
And I don't understand you.

38:04.720 --> 38:07.360
Which can result in an economy?

38:13.120 --> 38:18.640
Inasmuch, you need only one first jhana to dwell in it sufficiently enough,

38:18.640 --> 38:22.240
abiding it, and then all the fetters will fall off and you'll be an island.

38:24.960 --> 38:28.080
Yeah, because you don't need the extra jhana,

38:28.080 --> 38:31.280
you need the strength of the mind that pertains to the actual first jhana.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.480
But you can have different means of practice.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.800
You can arrive at that island and try to run with others,

38:36.800 --> 38:39.520
even if you never thought about it, heard about the jhana.

38:41.120 --> 38:45.440
So it's just a form of establishment of your mind, the way you can establish your mind.

38:47.280 --> 38:51.680
But when the word says, oh, you need the first jhana as a basis for the destruction of tains,

38:51.680 --> 38:54.480
means you need that strength of mind that corresponds to the first jhana.

38:54.480 --> 38:58.080
And which would correspond to that? To various other things as well,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.080
but they were talking about jhana at the time.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.600
It does seem to suggest in the city's value, if you...

39:19.600 --> 39:29.440
if there's the filaments, you can still establish your mind on these nine-year-old world,

39:29.440 --> 39:32.480
but you might have other defalments coming up.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.000
But your mind still can be established.

39:37.280 --> 39:43.680
And the more established it gets, the less lingering the filaments would be.

39:43.680 --> 39:50.160
Yeah, and he's obviously talking about you, someone's doing that, and they've got,

39:50.160 --> 39:55.600
it's like that you get to be born into one of the pure birds of pure.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.280
Yeah, in quite subtle realms.

39:57.280 --> 40:01.120
Yeah, the god's filed radians or the gods of the pure radians.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.640
They measure the radians of the limited radians.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.240
So it depends on how strong you're.

40:06.240 --> 40:08.720
Depending on how else do you mind with the binding, it does define...

40:08.720 --> 40:11.120
Well, yeah, relatively refined states.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.760
They're refined from pututions from the view.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.600
But, yeah, if your mind starts abiding and non-hacillic,

40:17.600 --> 40:20.880
non-year-old gets established upon Brahmavihars, that is your body.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.760
That is your state.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.560
It's nothing.

40:22.560 --> 40:25.600
I mean, you still perceive how this is more refined than what I used to do.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.240
Where I used to think, where I used to feel.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.880
But now it's the state that you have.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.960
So now you can recognize, oh, there is...

40:32.960 --> 40:35.120
You know, when they said it, they put the things about jhana,

40:35.120 --> 40:37.600
and they said he gets established in this, and it's great,

40:37.600 --> 40:38.800
and it's mindfulness up.

40:38.800 --> 40:39.520
Is there more?

40:39.520 --> 40:42.080
There is more.

40:42.080 --> 40:45.200
But it's an answer to go from more.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.120
For as long as you get the principle out of it,

40:47.120 --> 40:49.200
fully developed in you, you can run.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.160
Then you can go wherever you want to go or not.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.480
But yeah, for somebody who doesn't become run by the barge of those states,

40:58.480 --> 41:00.400
then the Buddha did say,

41:00.400 --> 41:03.840
oh, that these realms of rebirth correspond to

41:03.840 --> 41:09.600
binding those mental states, which is consequently

41:09.600 --> 41:14.000
abiding in the mental states that refuse with last

41:14.000 --> 41:15.600
version delusion.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.800
Well, but corresponds to that, it's the animal around.

41:18.800 --> 41:19.440
If you're lucky.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.080
If you're going to be the user,

41:24.080 --> 41:26.240
correct, you can view upon these god realms.

41:28.240 --> 41:28.800
It's kind of.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.320
What's the unfortunate thing?

41:32.320 --> 41:35.360
It's still a delusion, it's still a delusion.

41:35.360 --> 41:38.400
It's pleasurable, but it's still you have to go through with it.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.200
And it still comes to an end.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.240
One, if your efforts towards

41:49.760 --> 41:50.480
for a hundred,

41:50.480 --> 41:53.280
what do you mean?

41:53.280 --> 41:54.720
Like if you get your born in this garden?

41:54.720 --> 41:55.360
No, of course not.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.840
Your efforts to the barge cannot possibly waste it.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.840
That's why you're saying this most of it's there.

42:01.840 --> 42:05.520
Well, no, that's how you become, like that's how sometimes people

42:05.520 --> 42:08.320
over a course of lifetimes build up in health,

42:08.320 --> 42:09.840
and then they become out of hands.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.840
Because all the efforts from the previous lives,

42:11.840 --> 42:13.520
it's already not always.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.040
Nothing can go to waste.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.200
Well, sensuality goes to waste.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.400
Your will goes to waste.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.520
Ignorance goes to waste.

42:20.880 --> 42:24.400
Any effort made for our prodios cannot possibly go to waste.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.920
You might not get the immediate result,

42:26.640 --> 42:30.240
but it's like again, like a drop drop drop in the ocean.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.400
Bit by bit by bit by bit.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.840
If you fill up the entire ocean.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.960
So it usually happens based on the suit.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.400
So when people did pass away with them at the previous Buddha,

42:47.280 --> 42:49.360
they obviously go inspired,

42:49.360 --> 42:52.800
made offerings, lived with the exalted mind,

42:52.800 --> 42:55.520
then they got reborn in some great realms,

42:55.520 --> 42:57.920
enjoyed the celestial pleasures,

42:57.920 --> 43:01.440
and they passed away from there and reappeared again

43:01.440 --> 43:04.400
as humans and then fulfilled and became our hands.

43:05.520 --> 43:06.800
Now it seems like great man,

43:06.800 --> 43:09.680
I get all this pleasure and I become an arahant.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.680
No, the greatest pleasure is to become an arahant.

43:11.680 --> 43:14.000
So you're just delaying your pleasure through being reborn

43:14.000 --> 43:15.040
in these celestial realms.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.160
They can last for years.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.560
You could in this way, for years.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.360
That's, you know, you don't have a way that way.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.520
It's better than nothing is.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.640
Sure, better than nothing.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.760
Better than I remember them.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.440
But still.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.960
But if the efforts were generally naming a Mibana,

43:34.960 --> 43:36.320
that cannot go to waste.

43:36.320 --> 43:36.880
Impossible.

43:38.160 --> 43:38.560
Yeah.

43:39.600 --> 43:40.800
That's what the Buddha meant.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.000
Like if you cultivate the right view for a fingers net,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.560
if you cultivate loving kindness for a fingers net,

43:46.560 --> 43:48.560
that's how you make streams of merit.

43:49.920 --> 43:54.080
Because merit pertains to the future benefits of your present action.

43:54.080 --> 43:57.120
So through counting, through applying yourself,

43:57.120 --> 44:01.520
like you make merit through giving and offering.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.280
But that's nothing.

44:03.280 --> 44:05.760
In comparison to merit that you get

44:05.760 --> 44:10.000
through having a fingers net of the right view.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.120
You know, fingers net of genre,

44:13.120 --> 44:16.480
fingers net of Ramavihara's.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.880
So you need to, you know, you need to have the fingers net

44:20.880 --> 44:21.680
of the right thing.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.480
Yeah.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.320
Because I want to qualify that.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.640
Because then, you know, you do have people as well.

44:26.640 --> 44:30.160
As long as I'm trying, I'll make merit and I'll be fine.

44:30.160 --> 44:30.960
No, necessarily.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.320
If you're trying the wrong thing,

44:32.320 --> 44:33.680
if you're following the wrong teachings,

44:33.680 --> 44:36.640
if you're following things that cannot lead to understanding,

44:36.640 --> 44:38.400
well, you don't have the fingers net,

44:38.400 --> 44:39.920
even the fingers net of the right view.

44:42.960 --> 44:44.080
So it's not easy.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.280
But it is done.

44:45.280 --> 44:47.840
Even those fleeting moments of the right view

44:47.840 --> 44:49.440
or this streams of merit,

44:49.440 --> 44:51.760
which means yeah, exactly that in the future.

44:51.760 --> 44:52.960
Lots of benefits from it.

44:55.520 --> 44:59.520
Someone could say that most people abide in not your will.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.600
Yeah, but not most of the time I'm said a bit.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.960
You're right, except when I'm not.

45:04.960 --> 45:06.800
Except when I'm not in any, you know, once.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.000
Oh, I keep the precepts.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.280
Except when I don't.

45:09.280 --> 45:09.520
Yeah.

45:09.520 --> 45:12.000
But that's nothing in comparison to the time I spend

45:12.000 --> 45:12.800
keeping the precepts,

45:12.800 --> 45:14.960
thus my precepts are much greater.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.160
Yeah.

45:16.160 --> 45:16.560
Yeah.

45:16.560 --> 45:17.600
Come on, mind is not.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.560
I'm like an angel too.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.080
Yeah, but there is a difference in,

45:20.080 --> 45:23.120
you know, in knowingly abiding in on your will

45:23.120 --> 45:24.560
and being delusional about it.

45:25.840 --> 45:26.640
Not knowing.

45:26.640 --> 45:27.680
Not knowing exactly.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.360
Do you know what a phenomenon on your will is?

45:31.360 --> 45:31.840
You don't.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.920
So how can you possibly be abiding it?

45:33.920 --> 45:34.480
You know.

45:34.480 --> 45:34.960
Your mind.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.320
In delusion, exactly.

45:36.320 --> 45:36.960
You know, it's not even better.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.720
So your mind is where your real will is.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.720
It's just that your will is not always present.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.000
But delusion certainly is,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.760
which is why in the base of that delusion,

45:43.760 --> 45:45.040
you can have ill-gularizing,

45:45.040 --> 45:46.240
you can have hostility,

45:46.240 --> 45:46.960
lust,

45:46.960 --> 45:50.080
that's why delusion is the most fundamental

45:50.080 --> 45:52.000
for all of the unwholesome states.

45:52.000 --> 46:18.720
It's the basis from which they sprang out.
