1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
So, what was your question, can you repeat it?

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,280
Meditation.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,480
So, my question was that I didn't practice in meditation and I was here about meditations

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,440
and I've done two different techniques but when you say meditation I don't really know

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,520
like when then I do it, I don't know I just do it but if it's the proper way I'm doing

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,080
it, if I'm just looking myself, it's just, um, my technique.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:41,100
One thing to get out of the way is only so-to-poin and can meditate properly so there is no

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,560
samasama, without samadhi, so coming from that point of view you can see how silly the

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,480
idea of a technique is that you can teach to others whereby they just emulate and mechanic

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,960
properly repeat it, kind of leads automatically to wisdom or something.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:09,680
It doesn't, it leads to an experience of novelty or for kind and again, in connection

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,640
to what I said half an hour ago, previous recording was repeating something thousands

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,720
of times, right, based on your discernment, based on your faith, you know that these

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,360
attending things like this is most likely right so you repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat,

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,240
repeat thousands of times and then you get a confirmation, you get wisdom.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,920
You discern, oh it is right, what I've been doing.

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,280
So getting a template technique that can sometimes somehow lead you to that right state

18
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,760
is a rather, well it's obvious that it's kind of impossible because if I tell you a technique

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,440
that works for everyone and everything, it doesn't mean it doesn't require you to be

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:01,520
discerning anything, it just requires you to repeat these observances and these procedures

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,800
that I prescribed for you, observe the nostrils when this happens, you do that, when you

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
do that.

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:15,000
So it's not about like understanding, it's not about doing certain things, I'll tell

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,640
you, you will understand, you will get knowledge, if you are mindful of your shoulders and

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,640
you watch your breath in and you watch your breath out, how would it bring any understanding?

26
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,320
At most that will make you experience certain things, oh a novelty experience of your body

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,840
in this shape or that form or whatever else, but that is nothing to do with discerning

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
and understanding because in order to discern and understand you need to know what you're

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
supposed to discern and understand.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,360
If I tell you observe your act of breathing, seeing it as impermanent, seeing it as close

31
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,440
of suffering, well that's a different thing, but that's not really a technique, isn't it?

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,480
You can't say somebody, oh we'll try to understand things being given beforehand, which is

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,760
the reason for you not being able to own them in the first place, you can't present that

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,560
as a technique.

35
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,120
I can say it, it can make sense to you, you can attend things like that, but that's

36
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,560
the most that it can be and it doesn't need to be anything more than that.

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,680
So you know, I know for a fact lots of people get upset when you dismiss the techniques

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,680
or whatever they are, all the techniques have been helping me or whatever, what you as

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,000
a protrusion, they have no criteria of what health is, your criteria is, it feels good,

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,720
feels better.

41
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,160
So the absolutely the first step is to get a right view, then you'll know how to meditate.

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,000
So if you don't have a right view, then your meditation should be about gaffing the right

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:59,720
view, because when you say that meditation is dwelling on the view that you have attained,

44
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,320
dwelling on your right view, is meditation.

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,120
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,800
So, but there is other meditation.

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,480
There are many kinds of meditation, yeah, but only this one is the right one, as the Buddha

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,120
said himself, I think we'll have spoke that well, I'll look at that and I said, you premeditated,

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,280
overmeditated, undermeditated, mismeditated and so on, but he doesn't meditate and then

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,440
he compares it to a dog waiting for a hair or a jackal or a cat waiting for a mouse praying

51
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,880
upon something, that's usually what people's meditation is.

52
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
And you realize, if you look at all these techniques that have been to, that is actually

53
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
in common.

54
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,920
It's all about by observing, observing, looking as close as possible, praying, waiting,

55
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,040
waiting, and then it happens.

56
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,440
So it's all about getting an experience of a novelty kind, anything.

57
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,840
And no doubt you will sooner or later, why?

58
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,920
Because all the efforts you're putting in, all the efforts are close observation, but all

59
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,000
you're going to get is something you get when you look at things closer.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,600
But if that's all that's required for wisdom and niban and understanding, he wouldn't

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,640
need the Buddha to tell you how to do it and the whole formulation of the dharma in like

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,000
a great, great detail and so on, none of that would be necessary then for anyone.

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Because all you have to do is just look at things closer, if you look at things closer

64
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:34,840
as a pathogener, with your ignorance, all you're doing is looking closer at your ignorance.

65
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,040
And no knowledge can arise from that, because people are not going to think, you just need

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,400
to chop everything, just sit and be like a baby, steal or whatever else.

67
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,760
And don't judge, just go back to do whatever, promote the old state and that will teach you

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
what you need to know.

69
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,560
That's ridiculous.

70
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,640
True and true, experience we talked about in being affected by a Vija means whatever you

71
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,640
choose to stay with in your experience will be affected by that a Vija.

72
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,120
Everything is corrupted for the Tujana.

73
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,760
That's why I said, you can't accidentally step outside of your ignorance, why?

74
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,880
Because a repetition is required.

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,880
And in order to know that a repetition of something is the right thing, you get each other

76
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:33,520
ignorance, you need to be told, then you need to do it.

77
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,240
And doing is not just sitting and staring and waiting for things to teach you, because

78
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,320
things are affected with ignorance as much as you are, why?

79
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,080
Because they are part of your experience.

80
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,000
So everything top to bottom is affected with a Vija.

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,680
So even when you sit and meditate like that, all you're going to do is the meditate around

82
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,760
your Vija.

83
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,360
Which is not accidental that those people who are very much in technique will get upset

84
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,640
if somebody dismisses their techniques.

85
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,880
How would you get upset?

86
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,600
So the Tujana can't get upset if somebody disparages the Dhamma or whatever it was at all.

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,000
He will clearly know that person doesn't know what they're talking about, but he wouldn't

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
upset him.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's just impossible to take it personally.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,400
We said that also that the only, like if you're not assertive on it, during all sorts

91
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,080
of techniques, the best thing you can do, which is a kind of meditation in a way, it's

92
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,600
like trying to understand, to dwell on the suitors and go through them and to understand

93
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,440
each point so thoroughly.

94
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
That's an meditation in a proper sense of what?

95
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,760
You're reflecting with your own experience, because again, like even the first jhana which

96
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,120
is part of that meditation, it's thinking and pondering, or it's not an anomaly that

97
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,560
is actually thinking and exploration of the right things.

98
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,880
So it's just basically being whether you meditate or not, it's whether, when I say meditate,

99
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,080
whether you sit down cross leg or whatever posture you prefer, you're doing the same thing.

100
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,920
You're pursuing the right view and then the principles of the right view of the right

101
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
insight.

102
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,640
So you can do it more actively or more passively, but it's still the same thing.

103
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,560
So when you get the right view, then you can sit in the summer and practice the summer

104
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
tab.

105
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,320
But it doesn't mean forgetting about your right view and observing your kneecaps and shoulders

106
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,720
and top of your head and roof or your mouth and nostrils and your lungs.

107
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
It's just ridiculous.

108
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,520
Well, you can observe those things correctly from the salayatuna point of view and then

109
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,760
see how your body is just the composure of equal external element elements as the objects

110
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,280
around you are, upon which you directly stand as a your mind, your personality, and everything

111
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
else, and then disown it.

112
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Why?

113
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,760
Because eyes, roof, your mouth, shoulder, kneecaps, is all given beforehand, what I was

114
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,080
saying before, yet your life, as you know it, your past, your future, is inconceivable

115
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,440
to be inseparable, to be independent of this living body.

116
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:28,000
So this living body, less than two meters tall, full of organs, like a, like a, you know,

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,120
a sack of, sack of beans tied at the top, which is different types inside, that is the

118
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
reason.

119
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,480
That is the necessary cause, necessary condition for your whole life, for early emotions,

120
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,200
everything you've been through, everything you would go through, and you can't conceive

121
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
it if there's no, not, not, not, not a living body.

122
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,480
Thus, if that body comes to die, everything comes to an end, in that sense.

123
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:57,320
To recognize that you have no input over that body, no say, no control over it.

124
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,880
Any control you can exhibit is like what I spoke before, it's a movement along the given

125
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,880
lines, before, they were given beforehand.

126
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,000
So then you realize your whole life, whatever you've done, whatever you chose to do, your

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,400
volition, it all determined by this external thing, it's because of it, over which you

128
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,720
have no say, and now you can't ask for better meditation in that.

129
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,400
Get that inside, get that thought, and then dwell on it, dwell on it, dwell on it.

130
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,440
That's the repetition I was talking about, that's meditation, when meditation leads to wisdom,

131
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,120
not when meditation leads to some mystical novelty states, oh, I fell this trembling,

132
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,680
when I fell so peaceful, I fell this, I fell that, yeah, teach you get understanding

133
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,880
at the end of your meditation.

134
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Lots of people don't have that kind of armor, I might give myself that, if you're sitting

135
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,600
and to go and go watch your thought or think about a subject, what it seems to be better

136
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:03,000
for a person, is writing it out and actually writing things, not for publication, but actually

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,680
writing it out, describing it as I see it.

138
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,920
In a way that's what I think I should be doing, obviously with my, because as I'm doing

139
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,240
that writing, I have to bring most of that.

140
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
You have to dwell on it.

141
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,200
You have to dwell on it until it crystallizes to the extent that you're able to put it

142
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
in the words.

143
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,760
You don't just let it skim all of it, because you don't stop to kind of clarify anything

144
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
for yourself.

145
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,640
It is clarifying, but it's difficult, because you're mind skipping this way that way.

146
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,040
Exactly, because not used to clarifying the nature of things, so your meditation should

147
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,520
enable you to do that, so it's not accidental that meditation results in the stillness

148
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
of the mind.

149
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,640
It means clarity increases, the mind is jumpy less, so you look at things more clearly.

150
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,080
Again it's the same things you're trying to understand.

151
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,600
People have this notion whereby, okay, you're trying to study, you contemplate, you reflect,

152
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,520
and now it's a time for formal meditation.

153
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,000
When you don't do that, you do formal meditation.

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,200
What is formal meditation sitting down with your robot?

155
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,040
What is formal meditation, following a technique, what is formal, like watching your breath

156
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
or whatever?

157
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,920
But why do you do all of that in the first place?

158
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,960
Because you're going to be free from suffering.

159
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,680
And who knows the way that leads you out of suffering, it's at least a certain point.

160
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,880
So why don't you spend all of your time trying to become a certain person?

161
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,280
And you will know how to meditate and what to do and how to do it.

162
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:48,360
But I notice as well, like I struggle to do breath meditation, that's, you know, I try

163
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:56,640
to do it, but then I don't mind one is off whatever, but if I write about it, I end up

164
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
being calm.

165
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,440
You know, because then I bring it, you do it in the end, that's the way I'm holding

166
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,520
it all the time, so then, so it actually, I'm doing it without doing it the traditional

167
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,280
way, you know, by writing about it.

168
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Tradition of way is a dignified way, because the tradition is written by people, by

169
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,400
protugionists, by people who are not on the way to become out of house.

170
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:35,040
And that's not just an empty dismissal, it's just that if you look at it, people who

171
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,640
compile, compile commentaries and everything, they themselves said they were protugionists,

172
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,800
famous commentaries and so on.

173
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:51,280
You read the sutras, if the techniques were such a crucial factor, why would they never

174
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,720
talk about it, why there is not a single technique?

175
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:06,280
There's something I've got to notice as well, like the reason, what I can understand

176
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:17,840
or what I can intellectually comprehend, is that the reason the arahats later on, doing

177
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:25,120
write in the commentaries or they didn't do anything, it's just the putridionist that

178
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,320
kept on writing things and adding things, is that they notice that they don't need

179
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,600
for anything more than the sutras.

180
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,880
More than enough, yeah, yeah, everything, all of the stuff that's been written later on,

181
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,960
the preaching is now obscuring those things, because it's been written so long ago that

182
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,720
now people take it to be the same.

183
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,520
But you read the sutras and all the Buddha talks about all the time, he's understanding,

184
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,600
developing, understanding, but he full understanding, he always results in full understanding, whatever

185
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,920
approach of the practice you take, full understanding, what full understanding you get from having

186
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,560
a mystical experience that overwhelms you, he's absolutely no understanding there, not

187
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,440
even mindfulness often.

188
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,440
So discernment, knowing the cause of suffering, like knowing the gratification, knowing the

189
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,720
escape in regard to sensuality, in regard to various mental states, knowing the origin,

190
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,840
knowing the gratification, knowing the escape, like knowing, like really, fully understanding,

191
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,880
not analyzing, not getting all the facts, but fully understanding, penetrating with your

192
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,400
mind, knowing it.

193
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:47,280
And that's all, that's what it's all about, understanding the nature of things, understanding

194
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,480
the nature of things, results in freedom from suffering.

195
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:59,440
So I'm going back to my earlier question that, if I say, for the current state of mind

196
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:08,080
if I'm being reflective about my thoughts and my actions, and if I'm trying to be as

197
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:17,680
mindful as possible, is that meditation for my current state of mind?

198
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:29,320
Yes, you can say that, but obviously be mindful as possible, again, the better you know

199
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,640
what mindfulness is, the more established in mindfulness you are.

200
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:41,960
So it's not just a state you emulate, you also want to understand what is presence of

201
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:51,880
mind, what is the nature of it, what else appears there when I think I'm mindful.

202
00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:03,360
Well, mainly you're unsure, ignorance of what, what is, you see directly, you're not.

203
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,000
You want to be, you want to be like investigating at the same time, not just kind of, when you

204
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,560
sit and meditate, again, you want to meditate together as you.

205
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,640
You can't get the right view accidentally, so you can't just sit and be mindful of here

206
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,120
now, present moment, and then learn from it.

207
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,720
The only way you can learn from it is if you know why you're supposed to learn, if you

208
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,200
know why you're supposed to look for in things, otherwise you're just staying with your

209
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:39,080
ignorance, and you'll be as ignorant on the thousand day as you were on a day one.

210
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,720
So reading the sutras, and then if you want to sit and meditate the sutras, and then

211
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,800
there will be parts that will kind of make sense to an extent, or at least seem promising

212
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,320
that you might go, there is something to this, I could, what is in mind, I could perhaps

213
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,200
understand is better, and then take that to your meditation, and then dwell on it in

214
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,680
that sense that the Tanya was saying, don't just let it, you know, slip or slide, if you

215
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,960
need to, you write it down or whatever, but you want to plurify it.

216
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,680
And that's the thing, you know, I remember when I was doing work in meditation, and I got

217
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,400
into a lot, and you kind of just, in a pondering on the sutras and various things, and I might

218
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,480
have said this many times before, and you know, like the five aggregates, and then you

219
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,680
just think about the five aggregates, but then it occurred to me, well, when I read the

220
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:40,680
sutras that say consciousness or they talk about matter or feelings, why do I think

221
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:49,480
did I understood by the thought, what consciousness refers to, what feelings refer to, whatever

222
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,120
I, other aggregated with the mentions, why, why do I, why did I assume that I know what

223
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,720
they're refers to?

224
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,080
And then, then I started thinking, okay, so what is matter then, can I explain to myself

225
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,800
what Rupa is in my experience right here, right now, while I'm explaining it?

226
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,200
And then I went like that for every aggregate, and you realize that you don't really have

227
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,880
a clear idea, you just assumed, you just picked up and you have a vague kind of ambiguous

228
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,320
concocted concept of it, but if you stop and think, okay, when I say consciousness, consciousness

229
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,080
or if I say feeling, feeling, what does that exactly stand for, is there a clarity that

230
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,640
you don't know, and then you realize, well, that's what the practice is, undoing all these

231
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:44,320
wrong views and wrong concepts and misconceptions and misconceiving the things, that you just

232
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,120
stood for granted now, so now when even you come, even when you come to practice, the

233
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,760
stuff you did in the sort of, well, you approach it with same polluted concepts, tools,

234
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,440
not understood things, that you never question, you just start building on top of them, your

235
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,840
practice of Dhamma, so it's no wonder you end up following weird, various intense techniques

236
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,440
searching after praying upon like those animals in the sutras that the Buddha says, pray upon

237
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,720
its prey, wait for it, for novelty states, for mystical experiences, take you over, as

238
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,200
a form of validation or confirmation of what you've been doing, so your whole spiritual

239
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,920
life would be misdirected, because you never actually re-evaluated the very kind of basics,

240
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,400
and when you did, if you did, if you were, then you would realize, oh, the practice is

241
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,600
actually in a completely different direction, it's the direction of undoing, so that things

242
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,520
can be recognized correctly, not in finding out and rediscovering or something, like something

243
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,880
has been obscured, and you just, no, it's, well, it was obscured, you can say it was obscured,

244
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,720
by your own misconceiving, so you want to be able, that when you say to yourself, feeling

245
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,960
feeling, that statement, that designation stands directly, for that which feeling is

246
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,040
in your experience right there, and then, if there is no that clarity, that, well, there

247
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,880
you go, there's a work laid out for you, and you can specifically take feelings, because

248
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,760
craving is regard to feelings, and that's the whole point, learning how to feel and overcome

249
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:27,200
the feeling, thus, never ever again, experiencing suffering, the Buddha said, my teaching is, for

250
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:35,200
the one who feels, and he teaches only two things, suffering and fear for me.

251
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:46,840
I actually find a bit of an advantage, personally, for me, that when I approach it, with both

252
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:54,280
languages, it gives two different descriptions to each individual of the phrase, or it can

253
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,240
be, yeah, we get closer, closer to the meaning, in a sense, when you kind of, you look at

254
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,920
the parli, you learn the parli, then you look at different translations, different angles,

255
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,800
that all becomes necessary, but not for a scholastic purpose, but for the purpose of

256
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,400
clarifying, because you see, it's not about, again, finding out some, some, some, some divine

257
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:20,560
providence, mystical light, it's about undoing, your wrong views, so that you recognize

258
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,720
what the right view is, and when it comes to undoing, that's the whole point, you need

259
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,560
to have as clear as possible, instruction, so you know what to look for, like the utterance

260
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,000
of another, well, the Buddha's not around anymore, and, actually, even when he was, he referred

261
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,440
to a miracle of instruction, so being able to convey the dhamma to somebody, and they

262
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,440
fully understand it, and then become Arachandra Khandrava, equals to miracle, why bad will

263
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,920
you see yourself, because we all take things in terminology, to mean, you know, sometimes

264
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:04,320
completely, sometimes slightly different things, but even a slight variation in what it means

265
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,480
for me, when I uttered it for him, can be quite a lot at the end of the line, like you

266
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:17,000
imagine a boat or a ship is setting on a course, and in the beginning, you know, it doesn't

267
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,320
matter if it's a meter to the left, a meter to the right, but after, you know, thousands

268
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,800
of miles of journey, that tiny little kind of variation will result in missing a whole

269
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,600
continent, so that's where you want to get as much, because you don't have a criteria

270
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:41,880
about right or wrong, so you want to try to clarify for yourself as much as you can,

271
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:49,440
so that then you kind of decrease the chances of being wrong, later on, or at least not

272
00:23:49,440 --> 00:24:11,480
go too far off, I like to, let's come to a mind from this, and I think in a mind from

273
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:19,400
what that is, because this is thinking about it, clarifying that, which is quite helpful,

274
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,520
because then you can look at things better, you can try to do certain things better once

275
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,120
you know how to be mindful, because most people must be, must be, oh, I can be mindful,

276
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,880
I've just been being here and now present, but then you kind of, then how do you, well

277
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,720
exactly, because when you realize, yeah, you can be mindful, but if you have lots of wrong

278
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,040
view, you'll be mindful with your wrong views, and it's actually quite true, when you

279
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,760
take an average person sort of being mindful, if you were to us and to describe it, well,

280
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,080
first of all, they probably wouldn't be able to, the second, it would all revolve around

281
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,080
the wrong views of, as if I'm in the present moment, as if the present moment is sort

282
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:09,920
of, in a constant change, constant flux that I step into, just to remind myself of mindfulness,

283
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,240
then also another belief comes that, well, if I just have enough, a sufficient amount

284
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,320
of mindful mind moments, then I'll be, I'll reach nibbana automatically or whatever else,

285
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,600
but you realize, well, mindfulness is obviously the absolute necessity, but if you're not

286
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,000
knowing where to, how to do your avidja, what you're going to be mindful is, or rather

287
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,760
whatever you're mindful of, will be mindful of with your avidja, will be ignorant in regard

288
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,520
to it.

289
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,640
So mindfulness needs to, well, mindfulness and authenticity, like self-transparency, being

290
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,760
honest to yourself, is the first step, feeds on the other, but if you're genuinely mindful,

291
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,560
the first thing you're going to recognize is, I don't know, the second thing you can

292
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,000
come to sort of recognize is, well, okay, what do I need to know then?

293
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,040
And then you sort of start to narrow it down, you don't need to know everything, you just

294
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,280
need to know suffering and freedom from it, so that's why your mindfulness should also

295
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:22,560
be concerned there, with your feeling, what feeling is present, then it will become

296
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,520
apparent that actually, well, for example, as I mentioned, the idea of the, the idea of

297
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,560
the flock, the idea of, everything is constantly changing, it doesn't make sense because

298
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,440
if everything is constantly changing, they wouldn't be any change at all, so when you're

299
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,880
mindful, there is something, your experience is present as such, it's mindful, it's enduring,

300
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,960
which means if you were to then say, oh, it's constantly changing or any other wrong

301
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,040
view of that kind, that would mean you're adopting an external explanation to your present

302
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,080
experience, that it's not validated by your mindfulness, your mindfulness tells you

303
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,360
the contrary, which means you then ignore your mindfulness to explain it based on the

304
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,600
views that you accepted beforehand, so then you want to stop doing that really and then

305
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,280
develop mindfulness and then the views that come from what's evident in your mindfulness,

306
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,600
there was a whole idea of phenomenology, like the philosophical movement of essential

307
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,000
is basically describing only what's evident in a phenomenological art of which is the

308
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,080
mindful art of mindfulness, and then if anything else would fall off, no matter how plausible

309
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,160
it was, they would recognize, well, that's an explanation, and if it's an explanation means

310
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,760
it's not actually coming from the direct mindfulness, direct description, direct understanding,

311
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,880
as such it can be accepted, obviously, feminologists and essential philosophers couldn't arrive

312
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:53,480
at greater conclusions, but it's a valid method, because in that case, if you were to do

313
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,120
it, you can't, like, you know, you can go off the tracks a bit, left or right, but you

314
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,240
can't go off too far, because this principle of being based upon mindfulness is not abandoned,

315
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:12,240
so it will always bring you back and restart, but that means person will have to be willing

316
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:21,320
to completely let go, challenge, abandon his own most personal views, let alone not

317
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,280
get angry over it, or upset, or argumentative, but really genuinely whenever he approaches

318
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,200
to the new view, or to the view that sort of challenges his own view, he approaches

319
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,640
it with a sense as something that might be right, and it might has to be accepted, which

320
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,120
means that what he has now, even if it's years of practice invested, are always in question,

321
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,880
because that's what mindfulness is, but if you do it like that, then the solid core

322
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,160
will actually remain, and you will be abandoning everything unnecessary, everything wrong,

323
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,640
while the right things will stay there, why, because they were right, but it's not easy,

324
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:15,440
I mean, it comes to a point where you experience fear by reading different views, by reading

325
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,520
views that are challenging yours, by talking to people that are saying you're wrong,

326
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,240
like genuine existential anxiety, fear, it's not, it's not optional, holding views, it's

327
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,360
not optional, like views are what you are, it's kind of your own foundation, so challenging

328
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,720
them feels like you're really shaking your own foundation, well that's what most people

329
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,560
get angry, exactly, if you say I'm a meditation technician nonsense, how dare you say that,

330
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,840
I've been meditating for 20 years, well good for you, why do you get angry on a kind of

331
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,080
it, meditation is supposed to free you from greed, aversion, delusion, why are you getting

332
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:04,640
angry now, because of your meditation, that's a contradiction in terms, so you either

333
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,600
haven't been meditating rightly since you're not free from anger, or the Buddha was wrong,

334
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:19,000
so which one it is, we all know which one it is, so if I recognize that I don't have

335
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,840
any mindfulness, and in order to develop it, if I keep reflecting as much as I can, like

336
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,880
as the moment passes, oh, see there you go, what moment passes, not the moment passes,

337
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,840
nothing like, more like the moment that I pass, reflect, keep reflecting like on my actions,

338
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:45,760
as passes I can, no, see again, as fast, what, you're chasing something, are things moving

339
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,120
out, like if you don't see them immediately, are they gone, how can you think of them

340
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,640
then, even as gone, if they were gone, well if I can only, like I can't, we recognize

341
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,160
it as being a rising, but just, what do you mean, well exactly, so if you can't see the

342
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:10,560
point of origin, I think, if you can only find it as originated, what is that chase, why

343
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:19,440
why do you have to be fast, in any way, it's already there, and it's still there, and

344
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,480
it's persisting there, can I call that a mindfulness, or is that just a reflection, well that's

345
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:34,440
mindful reflection, that's mind, it's inseparable, sati recollected, sati sampajana, mindfulness

346
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:43,320
and awareness, sati is the same word used for memory, so that's the whole, this whole

347
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:49,040
misconception of kind of observing the external moment, chasing them, being fast, quick,

348
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:58,840
fast, the completely misguided view, if it's truly past, it's inconceivable, you can't

349
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,200
even think about it, you can't even speak about it in a past tense, it's gone, but the

350
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,800
fact that you can, means it's not gone, means it still persists, while it's changing on

351
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:18,800
some level, so you recognize that, you recognize the stillness within the particular movement,

352
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:28,400
you stay with the stillness, you're mindful of the movement, but if you go after the movement,

353
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,200
well, you're pulverated, you're done, and again, the symbol in the suit is a man who needs

354
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,960
to keep an eye on, I don't know, 20, 30, I don't know, 5,000 of children, he can't possibly

355
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,480
go around chasing after every one of them, if he does, he'll exhaust himself, even if

356
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,800
he doesn't, he can see only one at the time, the one that he is chasing, which means the

357
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:57,040
other 49 children are not, he's not mindful of, so he recognizes that instead of chasing

358
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,120
individually, he finds a slightly elevated ground from which he can see them all at once,

359
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,400
so he's not particularly involved with any one of them, but he can see them, so if one

360
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:14,280
of them goes too far, he calls them back, and that's like the basic practice of mindfulness

361
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,880
which is the practice of meditation, there is no, some other, there is no meditation of

362
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:28,080
any kind, without mindfulness as a foundation, he's basically sitting down, you can, I don't

363
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,080
know, be mindful of your breathing if you want, but don't sweat it, so to speak, but be

364
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,720
mindful of what you're thinking while you're sitting down, while you're seated, to be

365
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,560
more precise, but then don't try to be kind of chasing your thoughts of grower, or seeing

366
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,480
where they originate, or look for every moment of your thoughts, because they will assume

367
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,120
you being external to your own thoughts, or your thoughts external to it, but you are

368
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:58,040
your thoughts, so once you're mindful of them as what has a reason, or these thoughts are

369
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:03,880
present, leave it, just don't, don't, don't, don't, try kind of holding it tightly, trying

370
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:12,240
to see every like microscopic moment, because there is no such thing, that's an assumption,

371
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,280
what you have is such thought is present, then another thought is present, so you don't

372
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,320
want to interfere with it directly, but you don't want to lose sight of it completely,

373
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,160
again, you don't want to be chasing all those children all the time, you want to step

374
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:33,160
back so that you can see them more, more of them, without, so you're not chasing directly,

375
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,640
but you're not, not looking at them either, so that's the attitude you want to have with

376
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:44,480
your own mind, your own thoughts, when you sit down and meditate, let things arise, don't

377
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,440
interfere with it, because it's nothing to do with you in the first place, but then don't

378
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,560
lose the sight of it completely, and that's a practice in itself, practice of mindfulness,

379
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,960
practice of meditation, practice that can bring the discernment, thus, although even as

380
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,000
a protusion, you can be emulating things rightly, and if you emulate it long enough, it will

381
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,160
lead to the right results, so keeping a peripheral sight, keeping a corner of your eye on

382
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,920
your thoughts, is basically how you establish yourself in mindfulness, that allows other

383
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,440
things to arise, as this will change, in front of you directly, but at the back of your

384
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:30,720
mind, there is still a corner of your eye looking at it, so peripheral vision, you don't

385
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:39,360
stare at things that I can only see them, you need an example of a, like a dancer, you

386
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:45,040
stand by the gate, yeah, yeah, there we go, yeah, there is a certain, yeah, and you don't

387
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,840
, you don't shift the person and check, because you know what, you know, you figure out,

388
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,000
you understand, you discern beforehand, if whoever comes in, whoever goes out to have

389
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,120
to come to here, and that's all you have to do, just stay there, whoever came in, you

390
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,680
don't go after them, you know, they're in, that's all I need to know, whoever goes out,

391
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,680
you know, they're out, that's all I need to know, if something, there is a temptation,

392
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,680
it pulls you once you go in, you resist that, why, because you know, well, I leave this

393
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,720
entry point, this door, this sole entry point, I will lose a sight of everything else, so

394
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:28,240
you don't leave that, so it's like mindfulness of the feelings, or mindfulness of the nature

395
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,880
of your thoughts, which means you don't have to be mindful and concerned with every particular

396
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,160
thought, for as long as you're mindful of the thought is there, in the same sense with

397
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,560
the body, you know, to be mindful of the body internally, externally, internally, externally,

398
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:51,480
mindfulness, mindfulness, all, he's mindful of the body is there, to be extended, necessarily

399
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,120
for the final knowledge, so you know, such a general thought, ah,

400
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:07,080
body is there, he sees that always peripherally, because the body is always there, whatever situation

401
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:14,760
you're in, good or bad, neutral, left or right, up or down, your body is there, peripherally,

402
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,200
you know, you, you, 99% of your attention can be taken by whatever else, but in that

403
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,640
distance, peripheral distance, there is still a reclamation, there is still knowledge

404
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,680
of all is there, and that's your anchor of your mindfulness, which means that these 99%

405
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,800
cannot actually take you away, cannot overwhelm you, why? because there is still that 1% anchor,

406
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,800
proper, and that's what anchor is, you throw an anchor, you let it sink, and then you forget

407
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:49,800
about it, in a sense that you're not constantly pulling it up and throwing it in, pulling it

408
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,240
up, because that's pointless, and that's what meditation does, I end up doing it, I'll

409
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,880
just get back to the moment, get back to the moment, get back to the present moment, why?

410
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,200
You get back to the present moment, when you completely forgot about it, you get back

411
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:13,840
to it so that you can let it go, let it take its course, while you remain slightly

412
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,600
anchored in it, I peripherally keep an eye on it, so you throw an anchor, and then you

413
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:26,800
let the boat float away, and when an anchor is established properly, the boat will not float

414
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:34,960
away too far, or it will float away as far as the anchor allows it to, but the common

415
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,120
contemporary techniques basically will translate into throwing an anchor, and pulling it up,

416
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:47,000
and throwing it in for the sake of doing it, so you can never ever get a concept of mindfulness,

417
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,040
concept of things enduring, persisting while changing, movement within thing that is still,

418
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,440
why? Because you're constantly just joking left and right, just throwing it, throwing it,

419
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,440
throwing it, throwing it, throwing it, throwing it, what's the best tool point, you know,

420
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,840
because even trying to think about what the body is, you can't lose ground, but you know,

421
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,960
different times are different, that's why there's so many, like different foundations of

422
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,160
mindfulness, but what you're saying, like also what you're saying, experience as a whole,

423
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,480
you don't, you don't, you don't come across that term in the sutras, you've got the feeling

424
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:35,840
of mind, but when I hear experience as a whole, and I see that God, we experience as a whole,

425
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:43,080
it's happening now, that phenomenon, my experience as a whole, it seems to be easier to come on.

426
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,560
Again, I think that just depends on the person, yeah, but even within the same person, sometimes

427
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,880
you'll need to, you'll need to do different things, because sometimes, you know, like the

428
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,640
habit of ignorance, we still prevail, and then you'll end up just like not, not, not

429
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,440
getting the same mind, so you have to, that's why there's so many different approaches,

430
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,080
different types, sometimes just to refresh your mind, you would, you would take a different

431
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,560
approach, sometimes different approach will make more sense than the previous approach.

432
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,200
The point is, the principles of those approaches remain the same, the principle of mindfulness,

433
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,880
the principle of understanding, the principle of determinations, all of those remains the

434
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,800
same, but it doesn't really matter what particular manifestation of the principle you're

435
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,000
engaging in, or as long as you're aiming at the principle, it's all contributing towards

436
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:38,360
the same understanding, because why I like that experience as well, because I can't

437
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:46,040
doubt that I'm experiencing, but I can doubt, is this my body, is that my body, you know

438
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,920
it, but the body is there, you can't doubt, because all of these movements in regard to

439
00:40:51,920 --> 00:41:01,840
that body, is this, is this, is that, is that possible, because that body is a reason?

440
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,160
Yeah, sure, once you get it, once you come, because yeah, as it, as it, experience the whole

441
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:11,200
watching that, nothing else, nothing's going to happen without, it happening within that

442
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,680
experience, so it's guarding experience, you, and once you get used to guarding it, then

443
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,960
you can start making the effort within that and discerning it, so within that experience

444
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,680
as a whole, what is feeling, when I say feeling feeling, what does that stand within that

445
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,760
experience as a whole that I'm already mindful of, so you're creating like a ground on

446
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:40,880
which you can start doing the work, because it has to be something, and you're referring

447
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,000
to feeling feeling what does that designation stand for, what does it aim at, what does

448
00:41:46,000 --> 00:42:02,280
it signify, and you want to clarify that, does that mean I'm, again, paying attention

449
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,760
to one child, though, well that means you're doubting what's also, what's an also, if you're

450
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,280
paying attention to feel like it's also my also, and if you don't know if it's also my

451
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:23,840
also, so what you want to do is develop criteria, all of your mindfulness whereby recognizing

452
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,600
being mindful of something will already know if what you're mindful of is also my own

453
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:45,720
also, what's the criteria, well the criteria would be the right view, so reflection of an

454
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,040
action to be holding on, holding has to happen at a different time, well it can happen

455
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,600
through that, for as long as you don't deceive yourself into thinking that you already

456
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,400
know what's awesome, what's some awesome, only a person with the right view knows

457
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:02,720
this wholesome as wholesome, unwholesome as unwholesome, there's a tutor again, a two time

458
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,000
to thought, and he devised, the Buddha did, well, previous, before, he's not the Buddha

459
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,920
yet, but he devised his thoughts into two cards, that was his thought connected with

460
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:27,240
him, he'll go through the version, the version Alice, and then thought connected to non-heal

461
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:36,640
will, non-culti and renunciation, but then he reflects, is this what I'm doing, good for

462
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,520
me, good for another, does it bring about wisdom, and then it all, is it not good for me,

463
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,560
not good for another, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be sure, very flexible, through those questions

464
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,720
that kind of, then he knows that this is, this is wholesome, this doesn't disturb me,

465
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:05,200
it doesn't disturb anyone else, and I'm, my understanding is developing wisdom, so he,

466
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:17,440
but that's the criteria you can trust, even in the potusion, and you can see that none

467
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,960
of the techniques you would be doing in terms of meditation would come under that, always

468
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,480
than you're developing by watching a nostril, makes you feel good, makes you feel good,

469
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,320
so really it comes down to discernment, mental discernment, something that you cannot

470
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:39,040
put into a method, so you need to cause, oh, is what I'm doing, what I'm thinking, would

471
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:47,600
that be harm, would that imply, is that connected, harming others, harming me, harming both,

472
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:54,000
harming neither, okay, it doesn't seem this harming neither, but then is it also making me

473
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,640
discern things, is it making things clearer, so when I say feeling, feeling or when I say

474
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,040
perception, perception, doing no, what those things stand for clearer, and there is one

475
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,520
thing in these things out, is because those things are the five aggregates, and the five aggregates

476
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:15,600
are the ones affected with assumptions, with the wrong views, you do padana, so even in

477
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,520
your speech in designation, that's all form of, of, of, of, of padana, can be, if it stands

478
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:27,720
for wrong things, it expresses the wrong things, the wrong assumptions, so you want to have

479
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,560
things clear for you, not explained, not laid out, like, like, as a, as a nice little tidy

480
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,160
chart, a map of things, oh, this is what it is, this is what it is, you know, you want to

481
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,840
know exactly when you use after a designation, you know what it stands for, phenomenologically.

482
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,280
That's why I reckon, so that's what means like developing the sermon, developing wisdom,

483
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,880
that's what it's necessary, and you have to keep thinking like that, because if you are,

484
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,280
well, you will at least be striving in the right direction, but if you don't see that

485
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,640
as a criteria, developing that kind of wisdom, then exactly, then you can, yeah, what,

486
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,400
watching, watching my nostrils, doesn't harm anyone, doesn't harm me, doesn't harm others,

487
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:19,720
so it's great, well, exactly, it doesn't, and when it comes to developing wisdom and understanding,

488
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:25,600
there is no method you can engage in, as I said before, it just doesn't work like that.

489
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:40,400
It's, it's, it's to each individual, and it's also understanding in this sermon of

490
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,880
the nature of things precedes the designation, the nature of designation, so you can hear

491
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:53,120
the instruction, but then you understand what it pretends to, it precedes it, that's

492
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:59,040
why the Buddha referred to it as miracle, so that connection is something through your own

493
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,680
efforts can become apparent, and you're so responsible for that, which means even the

494
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:13,440
instruction utterance of another can go only so far, but then me designating you a set

495
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,120
of, set of methods and observances you go through, and then you just adhering to it, that

496
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,800
can that somehow magically lead you onto that connection, that you, your self-responsive

497
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,600
connection understanding, that doesn't, doesn't work, which is why it's wrong, it's a

498
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:37,240
fetter, seal about the Paramasa, holding onto virtue and duty, like people translate that

499
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:43,680
seal about the Paramasa is holding onto rights and rituals, whereby it means rights and rituals,

500
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,400
and that that's kind of obvious, we all know that, you know, piling to the random stone

501
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,200
shrines doesn't mean anything, so we all abandon that fetter, we just do it for whatever

502
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,000
reasons, but we know it's not the practice, but actually the, the pali is seal about the

503
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,920
Paramasa, seal is the virtue and duty, seal about the Paramasa means holding onto the

504
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:14,400
sense of virtue and duty, and basically holding onto thinking, your seal, your purity,

505
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,760
your valid, genuine purity is what practice is, holding onto, onto your sense of duty as

506
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,320
somebody who practices the Buddhist teaching, or I should be doing this, I should be meditating,

507
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,560
I should be holding onto that to be the practice, all of that is a fetter, why, because that's

508
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:35,200
not the practice, and it did say, there is no dhamma without vinaya, but vinaya is not

509
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:41,520
dhamma, and dhamma is not vinaya, but obviously you need vinaya in order to be able to practice

510
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:52,360
dhamma correctly, but dhamma is not vinaya, dhamma is not seal, so even your preset,

511
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,280
you need to be pure, you need to be kept, and nothing to do with dhamma, you can ignore

512
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,520
that, dhamma is elsewhere, and if you look at it, why, well it's obvious, because

513
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:09,560
presets are something you do, you observe techniques are something you do, you perform, but understanding

514
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:16,760
of the nature of things is something you cannot do, you cannot perform, this is completely

515
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:23,400
different domain, obviously the understanding of the nature of things cannot happen, if

516
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,680
your behavior has not be purifying externally to keep in the presets and not engaging in

517
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:39,960
maintaining and wholesome things through those bad habits, but that purification through

518
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,120
that behavior is not the understanding, because you can be as pure as, you know, anything

519
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:50,800
that comes, but still not understand things, so there is no guarantee of understanding

520
00:49:50,800 --> 00:50:00,280
through following methods or observances or duties, why, because that's not what understanding

521
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,840
is, it obviously like, you know, that does not mean that, oh I can do whatever I want

522
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:13,320
and get in the standing, well if you didn't understand things, when things were favourable

523
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:19,840
for you, when you were keeping the presets, where you are not increasing the greater version

524
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,960
of the illusion, well then you are certainly not going to understand when your behavior

525
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,160
is increasing the greater version of the illusion, hence it's a necessary prerequisite,

526
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:38,200
but it's not it, so you can see why then like thinking, oh certain prescribed technique

527
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,360
or can you, Ajahn, can you give me a technique or something I can do that will lead me to,

528
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,400
you know, magical place of Arhantji, it's actually a very serious, wrong view because

529
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:55,000
it becomes an impediment, because you think that you are actually practicing by observing

530
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,760
this mechanical technique, which means that's where your effort stopped, you don't stop

531
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,440
and then start reflecting on that, the nature of what you're doing, which is what understanding

532
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,080
is, no you're just doing it, just doing it, I just repeating, budo, budo, budo, budo,

533
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,240
like a robot and that brings me full understanding of stuff, yeah right, if that brings you

534
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,320
into understanding then the whole tipitaka would be just budo, budo, budo, budo, budo,

535
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,520
budo, budo, budo, wherever you're opening or whatever you're paying to open it, but

536
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,280
it's not, not even once, never the budo say you just repeat this mantra and it will establish

537
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:36,800
you in mindfulness, many other followers and the emptyages of different sects and religions

538
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:45,160
said that, and they were all mentioned as wrong, right, because nothing may happen,

539
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,840
any mechanical such as repeating, budo, budo, or watching the tip of your nose or can

540
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,640
bring understanding, the only thing that can bring understanding is your attitude that's

541
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:01,080
trying to understand, and that attitude can be in regard to anything that is established

542
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:07,840
upon wholesome, hence the meditation techniques, well they're wrong because people think

543
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,640
them, take them to be right, but in themselves they're not even wrong, they're absolutely

544
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,680
pointless, you can be watching your nostrils or not, what's the point, you can watch tips

545
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:24,120
of your ears, like the budo, when he's teaching, he's talking about these things, certain

546
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:31,160
things, you know, five days with the followers, he's talking about these things, and people

547
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,440
understand, they get people from something, because they're understanding the designations

548
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:42,280
that he's using when he says, he's not ringing a bell, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, and

549
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,000
they will become our hands, right there and then by listening to them with a speak, not

550
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,200
by watching their nose for three hours, and then we go walking, yeah, understanding what

551
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,240
he's talking about, isn't it, actually paying attention, paying attention to designations

552
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:05,080
that he's using, and then seeing them for what they are in their own experience, they

553
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:11,920
have the right attitude, trying to understand, and the designations that himself were operating

554
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,800
were not as polluted as most of other people today's designations are, so then it's nothing

555
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,640
magical about people becoming our hands upon listening to budo speak, oh, well, you know,

556
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,040
the budo knew their mind, yeah, sure, but that's not the reason why they became our hands,

557
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,280
they became our hands because they understood what he was saying, right, so if now you don't

558
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,240
understand what the budo is saying in the sutras is because you just have so many obstructions

559
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:41,400
and assumptions of your own doing, which you're fully responsible, obscuring the meaning

560
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:50,360
of the sutras, so undo your own assumptions, undo your own designations to the extent necessary

561
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,440
whereby you read the sutras and it's directly describing your experience, when that's

562
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,960
the case, 100% you'll be an arah, because every sutra describes experience of an arah

563
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,960
or how to be humble.

564
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:12,440
If you read a sutra and it seems like common sense, oh, that means you have some serious

565
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:20,200
work to do, and yellow to people say, well, this is just common sense, it's just repetition.

566
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,840
If you think of it just in terms that I said, imagine if every designation of the budo

567
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:30,440
would use stands for direct description of your experience, then him repeating it through

568
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:36,760
different aspects of it would be bringing it in your experience, one aspect within the

569
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,840
other, within the other, within, so you can see it's almost like a natural progression

570
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:46,880
of understanding, like fortifying it in regard to this, in regard to this, within that,

571
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:54,080
within this, you realize the sutras are far from just repetitive kind of tautological

572
00:54:54,080 --> 00:55:00,080
folklore descriptions of something, it's actually direct phenomenological instruction

573
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,680
and like leading on further and further and further in developing of your understanding

574
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,960
and your purification of your own designations, they were carrying around assumptions.

575
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:20,160
So if you approach it directly, rather correctly, if you approach it correctly, we derive

576
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:27,280
view and phenomenological mindfulness establish reading the sutras would be like directly

577
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,000
purifying your own experience while you're reading them, because that's what they are.

578
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,440
Hence repeating it for 20 times would be 20 repetitions of purifications, 6 times, 12

579
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,520
times, 18 times, no matter how many times it will be, you would read it and each time it

580
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,880
would be a purified image of a correct designation, things standing correctly for what they are.

581
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,960
So reading the sutras becomes the direct practice, the direct insight.

582
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:03,440
Which is how it was when the Buddha was speaking, to those who became sotapanas or arahants

583
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:11,880
upon listening.

584
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:18,280
So that's why repetition in the sutras, because it's not explaining, it's a direct description

585
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,080
of your experience and if you repeat it 6 times in regard to every sense, that's how

586
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,280
it needs to be seen, repetitively in regard to every sense.

587
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,280
Why?

588
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:34,280
Because if you leave a sense and turn, ignorance will stay there.

589
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:54,080
Yeah, far from, okay, we're talking about the other day, but John has been, you know,

590
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:00,880
by thinking and pondering in the correct way, one enters the John's, because you know,

591
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:07,080
he secluded from unhulsing states, you guiding your mind, so you notice I'm secluded from

592
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,600
awesome states, anything has to come through, has to come through here, I'm really straining

593
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:19,080
my senses, my senses are guarded, and then you enter, well, they've become joy and so

594
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,080
on.

595
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:24,080
So it's just, there is no blanking out ever.

596
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:30,120
No, no, no, no, no, you know, the sutra one by one, I think it was 109, am I doing

597
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
that?

598
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:36,240
About Sadi Puthas going through different sort of establishments of his mind, the first

599
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,200
John, the second John, the third John and so on, all the way up to station perception

600
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:48,040
field, and every of those states had mindfulness, first John, the second mindfulness there,

601
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:55,440
fully established, just fortifying that same mindfulness, which is not like completely the opposite

602
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,080
of what people expect to achieve through various meditation techniques, when you're just

603
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:06,680
not aware of anything, is it sorry, I went to the state, I went to the state of neither

604
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,200
perception or perception, because I don't, just the state I entered, and the next thing

605
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,840
I know, it was five o'clock in the morning, it's like, yeah, we heard you're neither perception

606
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:22,400
or perception snoring, or like, oh yeah, well, I go into this state when I don't hear

607
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:29,840
or see anything, or whatever, that's a good meditation, not according to the sutras,

608
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,000
I mean there are neither perception or perception of genuine kind, cessation of perception

609
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,680
and feeling, but in order to get there, your mindfulness has to be utterly, completely

610
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,680
unshakable.

611
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:46,680
A lot of people refer to this mind to, you know, this is a feeling of experience, isn't

612
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,680
it?

613
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,320
Well, yeah, like, you know, I kind of, in the beginning, I was given a benefit of doubt,

614
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:56,520
and then the more they talk about it, you realize, you were just asleep, mate, or you

615
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,640
know, when you go in a state, when you can't fall asleep, because you're not lying down,

616
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:07,720
but you're kind of half out, lots of people end up in that state, because they're seated

617
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,680
on the floor, so you can't quite fall asleep, that's why I lie down, that's why I lie

618
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:18,000
on, which again, that that that that genre is confirmed by kind of external eye of nodding,

619
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,400
you can see them nodding left and right, bobbing and weaving sort of, oh yeah, I have a good

620
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:30,160
meditation, yeah, we saw that.

621
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:38,000
So again, it's the lack of a person being authentic, they lie to themselves, and yeah,

622
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,720
you know, quite a few people like that that are met, were very sensitive about a topic of

623
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,480
meditation, they would be implied, they're maybe not meditating rightly, or if somebody else

624
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,280
would be implying indirectly that what they're doing is not right, they give a upset,

625
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:58,200
you know, well, what's the point of your meditation, if you hold on to it so dearly and personally,

626
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:07,240
you're getting upset, if somebody criticizes it, and surely you're not doing it right,

627
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:14,840
if someone else's random video can shake you up so much, you can offend you, you should

628
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:30,360
be grateful anyway, exactly, like there you go, I just laid it out for you, that's why,

629
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:39,200
if I read this Roman philosopher's Greek philosopher, they sought out challenges, you know, yes.

630
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,640
You sought out a challenge of your view, not the challenge to prove your seal is good

631
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,520
or something like that, which some of those people do, you want to challenge your views,

632
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,520
absolutely.

633
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:54,880
So someone says, oh, I tell you your view, that's the attitude you can be sure about, they

634
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:03,160
can't lead you to wrong, is attitude of challenging every view, no matter how dear to you it is,

635
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,240
and that's it, the views are dear to you, but they said, oh, surely you're holding to

636
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:14,560
the view because it pleases you, it's dear to you, you know, when that man said to the

637
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:20,400
Buddha, I don't hold to any views, no views are pleasing to me, and he said, well, surely

638
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:30,600
that view is pleasing to you, and he said, oh, okay, yeah, you have a point there, but

639
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:37,000
when you have a view, that no view will be dear to you, including that view, in a sense,

640
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,640
that whatever view you have, you recognize you always have to have a view, you can't

641
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,680
have a state of no view, because that's a view, which means if you believe it's not the

642
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,560
view you're contradicting yourself, thus you're even more wrong, so it's not about not having

643
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:56,680
any views, which is impossible, it's about finding the right view, and then going beyond

644
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:02,360
even the right view, which is possible, which is our answer, but in order to get the right

645
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,920
view, you must not hold to any view for the sake of pleasing you, oh, this view is pleasing

646
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,640
to me, you can't help having a view being pleasing to you, but where you can't help is

647
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:23,800
not leaving it unturned, not taking for granted, not leaving it unquestioned, so you get a view,

648
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,760
then you find the views that are opposing to the view, and if you think, oh, this is a

649
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:35,120
wrong view, well, you need to fully understand why, how, and where that view is wrong, not

650
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:39,560
just decide this is wrong because somebody else said, even the Buddha, or the Buddha said

651
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:45,400
that, well, sure, but do you understand it for yourself? Do you understand why wrong views

652
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:51,520
are wrong, if you do, you have the right view? Yes, it's dangerous, so I think it's probably

653
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:58,640
useful if someone, you know, someone who can challenge you, you know, if you don't have

654
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:05,640
any good challenging, then open any book, because you're bound to think, oh, these views

655
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:10,440
are wrong, well, open those books, read them, and try to see for yourself why, how, and

656
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,760
where those views are wrong, not just assume they're wrong, and same, oh, the Buddha's

657
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:22,120
right, okay, open the suitors and understand where, how, and why, it's right, and if you're

658
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:28,760
doing it correctly, you'll see, you'll be fearful, you'll be like anxious, to read other

659
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:34,240
stuff that you think it's wrong because you might not see, it is wrong, thus, you're

660
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,040
not as right as you think you are, but that's inevitable, you have to go through that.

661
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:47,040
Yeah, it feels like the thing that you think is wrong, because if there is anything right,

662
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:54,960
it's that which cannot be taken personally, and it will stay, it will stay on, you won't

663
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:01,880
drop off. Yeah, it can't be, no one can challenge it, yeah, no one can take it, you can't

664
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:09,760
challenge it, you've been challenging it, you've been like, like attacking it without, and

665
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,480
whatever was susceptible to doubt, was affected by it, except those things that were beyond

666
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:24,080
doubt, so you go beyond doubt by basically reaching a point where the doubt cannot enter,

667
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:29,400
not because you were shying away from doubting it, but because you were doubting full on,

668
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:35,560
you fully became doubt, and then you recognize that their points, the doubt cannot enter,

669
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:42,360
and that's doubt free, it's beyond doubt, beyond doubt means inaccessible to doubt, doesn't

670
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:49,600
mean, oh, I never doubt this because, yeah, I fear, I fear that if I doubt, I might change

671
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:56,680
my mind, re-evaluate everything, and 30 years that I invest in this, down the drain, yeah,

672
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:04,600
from the day one, full on doubt, very unpleasant, but, you know, relatively quick way of progressing

673
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:14,080
if you do it right, because you know, oh, this is beyond doubt, not because I'm not doubting

674
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:27,040
it, because it's nature, it's impenetrable to doubt.
