1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,880
It's hard to practice noble silence by not engaging in any distracting behavior by practicing

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:35,120
wakefulness. So anything that you discern that it's rooted in an unnecessary desire to distract

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,840
yourself, to take your mind away from your present situation and your mindful off, that's

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,480
basically against the practice of wakefulness. But it's also important to note it's not

5
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,120
like you don't need to be forcing your mind like I'm present I'm present because your

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,120
present where you want to be or not, it's not an option. It's not an option, it's not

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,800
optional. Lots of mindfulness, lots of wakefulness, all these things are rooted in basically

8
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,720
unwholesome intentions which means you cannot become un-wakeful, non-wakeful if you don't

9
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,000
engage in any intentional act based on greed andversion delusion. So if the mind's intentions

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,560
are not rooted in any of the unwholesome things, that you cannot be un-wakeful. And that's

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,560
already a noble silence, you're not distracted. This means you never speak to anyone or you

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,440
never do anything whatsoever. You just don't do things that are rooted in desire of greed,

13
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:42,040
aversion or distraction and delusion. Why is it silence? Because the mind quives

14
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,880
down. When the mind is distracted, the thoughts, the verbal thoughts, the kind of dialects,

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,960
it's going on, the whole dialectic of thinking. But once you haven't been, and again people

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,360
who are going to stop this thinking, well you can't stop the thinking. You can quiet

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,120
it down by seeing basically the thinking, the loud thinking, so to speak, is a symptom

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,600
of your lack of your proper restraint, not restraining your mind in a proper manner in

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,200
a sense of not delighting in the last version of delusion, resisting delusion, resisting

20
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,440
the version and engaging in distraction and delusion. But if you start discerning that,

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,200
that's what quiet is the mind down. You can't know, I'm on my mind quiet, I focus on

22
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,240
my nostrils and I'll be quiet. No, you just fall asleep most likely. Or going some

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,160
state of like focused attention to something, but again, you just lost the awareness and

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,600
the mindfulness completely, which is not different than if you fell asleep. So you want

25
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,560
to see basically that the problem is not in you not trying hard enough to be in the

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,880
present moment, which is again, not the matter of choice. The problem is you're not understanding

27
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,720
the nature of intentions enough, but not understanding it, you don't know when they are rooted

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,920
in greed or a version of delusion, you have no idea. You're just guessing, sometimes

29
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,600
you guess you're right, sometimes you don't, but you don't see that, which means you're

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:13,440
going to have a very reason. So the mind will quiet down when the physical

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,480
restraint and seal has been developed. The verbal, you know, verbal actions are kept in

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,480
check. And then mentally, you just don't give, don't give in to the like presented

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,800
options of centrality or a version or distraction. If you don't, just don't give in to those.

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,160
If they are not those, that's fine. You don't have to be a harmless, be mindful not. You

35
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,080
are already mindful, but not giving in. You're already mindful, mindful, because you're

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,600
already abstaining from certain types of mental intention, which are the unwholesome types.

37
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,280
So basically, things you don't do, that's what becomes your present activity in that

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,960
negative sense. That's why it's not on a level of doing or on a level of technique.

39
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,360
You can't be doing the abstaining from this thing. No, it's just discerning certain things

40
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,880
that you won't be giving into. Then everything else, it's not those things, that's fine.

41
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,000
That's why the Buddha, even when he was sort of instructing mind's heart to understand

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,360
the jhana and establish the mind in jhana, he would say, he would say, don't like fear

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,000
every pleasant experience, because they had the attitude of whatever's pleasant is a problem.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,160
It should be dismissed, so they were interfering with things they shouldn't have. Because

45
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,680
if it's agreeable and not deluded in desire or version of delusion, it's not a problem.

46
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,280
And you're assuming that you go away, well it's you overstepping your jurisdiction,

47
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,080
you interfering with that, which is not yours.

48
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:59,200
So some people might think that locking themselves into a situation of solitude, no distraction,

49
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:08,080
no TV, it's just being like a prisoner basically, not a jail, solitude, solitude, solitude,

50
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:19,000
confinement. But most people in that situation go mad, don't stop thinking, no, no, it's

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,040
not. Again, if a person knows what they're doing, as in they understand the nature, they

52
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,000
can discern the nature of their, that indirectly, the nature of their intentions, they can see

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,840
when they're rooted, then yes, solitude will just result in further clarity. That's

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,240
why the Buddha would encourage monks, provided already had the right view and establishment

55
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,480
in sealer and restraint, to go in the jangular remodeling, not socialize, even without

56
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:54,360
the monks and so on. But if you don't have that knowledge, then well again you might sort

57
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,600
of use it while keeping a notion in your mind that you must develop knowledge. But sometimes

58
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,040
people forget that and then they try to get the circumstances to do the work for them.

59
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,280
So then I'll go for a three-month retreat to burn mine a cookie and people would just bring

60
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,560
me food, I won't see anyone and so on, thinking that that kind of stream solitude will sort

61
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,640
of result in freedom and might be, but you won't. You can only support the knowledge. If

62
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,840
you don't have the knowledge, that's it. You're just staying in the solitude and you will

63
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,880
not necessarily learn from it. Because if the solitude would always result in, then yes,

64
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,200
exactly the solitary confinement prisoners with OBI and Serrana Garnis. But I don't know.

65
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,400
There's been a wave from the found, a wave from unhowsome intentions, long enough.

66
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,120
Well, it's knowledge of what the firements are and unhowsome intentions. That's what

67
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,120
frees you. Being away from them is necessary to an extent to start discerning that knowledge.

68
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,080
But if you have no notion of what that knowledge is, no matter being away from those developments

69
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,400
will approve them. If anything, it would just conceal them further because now you don't

70
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,080
really don't know where to look for them. Because before, there were things kind of, they

71
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,800
would sort of prop the issues up for you and then you would see the issues are still there

72
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,800
and that's how you could judge your work. But in a completely solitary confinement, without

73
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:30,800
that prior knowledge, now you really don't know where to look or what to do.

74
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,400
So you're getting the strength being the necessary basis.

75
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:42,080
The strength being the necessary basis, yeah. And usage of solitude to use it to gain the

76
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,080
knowledge, not to use it to avoid the circumstances that bother you and you don't know how to deal with.
