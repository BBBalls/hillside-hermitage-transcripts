WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.880
One can convey the body with rapture, competing, very early on in the transfer, you have

00:23.880 --> 00:30.880
that intention to convey the body, which is relaxing, which is energizing.

00:30.880 --> 00:38.040
The important thing is to know that it's on the level of intention, so it's on the

00:38.040 --> 00:45.480
level of your mind, not on the level of observation of physical sensations or body sweeping

00:45.480 --> 00:48.400
or whatever else people might do.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.000
All of those little things that you're kind of trying to patch up, they're all imping

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
this intention.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.200
But if you're not seeing the intention to convey the body with rapture, none of these

00:58.200 --> 01:02.680
things can actually bring any understanding, and that's an important thing, you want

01:02.680 --> 01:03.680
to develop understanding.

01:03.680 --> 01:08.840
You don't want to just keep having to go through body sweeping, the attention, relaxing,

01:08.840 --> 01:15.440
relaxation technique, shavasana or whatever else, because again, that's all, well, it's

01:15.440 --> 01:19.840
aiming at the wrong thing, and that wrong thing might sometimes imply the correct intention,

01:19.840 --> 01:25.400
but you don't even know what correct intention is, which means you want to discern it.

01:25.400 --> 01:31.520
So perverting your body with rapture or relaxing your body, it's done to the body as a

01:31.520 --> 01:36.440
unit, as a whole, through that general intention of relaxing.

01:36.440 --> 01:41.000
And you can even relax yourself by trying to understand what the relaxing is, as a phenomenon.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.360
Just as I say, relaxing, relaxing, what is relaxing?

01:43.360 --> 01:48.600
Like if somebody tells me to relax, and I want to relax, what do I think?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.640
What is the attitude that I have?

01:50.640 --> 01:56.680
And that attitude, basically it's an attitude towards, from attitudes of the mind in regard

01:56.680 --> 02:03.080
to the body as a whole, not just as I said before, towards your elbows or shoulders or

02:03.080 --> 02:13.720
whatever else, as a whole, it's all the other things people do in a country, just because

02:13.720 --> 02:19.680
they don't really know where to look, and then all these things might sometimes injure

02:19.680 --> 02:24.760
the genuine relaxing, the genuine rapture, but they don't know why or how, which means

02:24.760 --> 02:28.680
they don't understand it, so they just stumble upon it when it comes, and they don't,

02:28.680 --> 02:33.840
they wouldn't know how to do it again, because you know when people say, oh, in the

02:33.840 --> 02:40.760
sutras, oh, I am taking janas at will, that's done through understanding, to pull understanding

02:40.760 --> 02:45.240
what janas are, and then you just say, again, you know, they don't come by chance.

02:45.240 --> 02:55.280
Yeah, janas is a particular attitude, particular establishment of mind in regard to the body,

02:55.280 --> 02:59.320
and then you keep refining that, but it's the same, it's the same principle.

02:59.320 --> 03:06.640
But you're going to be able to notice that general attitude of whatever it is that you

03:06.640 --> 03:12.960
want relaxation, for example, you've got to be able to, oh, I know how to relax.

03:12.960 --> 03:18.040
Well, exactly, yeah, and you know how to relax, but trying to find out how to relax.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.040
Yeah.

03:19.040 --> 03:25.280
Again, find out in terms of discerning the nature of what end-tension to relax is at

03:25.280 --> 03:30.440
the time, not just by reading about some, I don't know, relaxation self-help books and stuff

03:30.440 --> 03:33.280
like that.

03:33.280 --> 03:41.920
So, if I tell you just, can you just relax now, just sit and relax, and you can kind

03:41.920 --> 03:45.240
of let it sort of, oh, quickly, whatever, but if you stop and think about it, what would

03:45.240 --> 03:46.240
you do?

03:46.240 --> 03:54.480
What would you intend, what kind of attitude would you arouse in regard to the, your present

03:54.480 --> 04:01.960
situation that is sort of routine in your body, if you want to relax, if you want to relax.

04:01.960 --> 04:05.720
So you could describe it in different ways, then, you could say up a very, very red

04:05.720 --> 04:09.560
chair, you could do this, who you can say, like what, what, what, what the Anaprasad

04:09.560 --> 04:17.240
said, says, calming, calming down the bodily determinations, so the bodily, the samkara

04:17.240 --> 04:29.880
is basically things, things upon which, sorry, bodily things upon which other things depend,

04:29.880 --> 04:36.160
but you don't, again, samkaras are always plural in that sense, but what you can, what

04:36.160 --> 04:42.320
you can do is recognize that plurality as a single phenomenon, so your body as a whole,

04:42.320 --> 04:47.440
has all sorts of manifestations, all sorts of intentionality that pertains to that, so

04:47.440 --> 04:52.760
you do basically, it's, oh, you can't that hold down, and all of these particular things

04:52.760 --> 04:55.520
account as a result.

04:55.520 --> 05:01.320
If you have the intention of calming down your body on that general level, on your mental

05:01.320 --> 05:08.200
level, then whatever you do with that body cannot be not calmed, if you generally calmed.

05:08.200 --> 05:15.000
Because you, usually, I would think, yeah, you calm down your breath, you make the breath,

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
yeah, light or slower, and then that's what affect your body, that's going to affect

05:21.000 --> 05:25.560
your muscles, whatever, like still trying to mess around in a particular way.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.320
Yeah, chasing this, the mother is out in that, but basically sometimes people say, yeah,

05:31.320 --> 05:35.960
but it helps me, or, and the only reason it helps is because at the time, that particular

05:35.960 --> 05:40.920
thing they're trying to calm down stands for the both experiences of bodies as a whole,

05:40.920 --> 05:45.560
because if you're so concerned over, you know, I don't know, some particular aspect of

05:45.560 --> 05:49.800
your body that's worrying you or that it's, that it's extremely not calmed or whatever

05:49.800 --> 05:53.760
else, then yeah, calming that down would stand for calming down the whole body, because

05:53.760 --> 05:57.920
basically for that time, that particular aspect of the body stands for that which body

05:57.920 --> 06:05.400
is in your experience as a whole, and, but that's why people who do have that view and

06:05.400 --> 06:10.840
do that, they can't do it at will, they can only do it when it happens that the particular

06:10.840 --> 06:15.120
aspect they're focusing on stands for the body as a whole, but that won't always be the

06:15.120 --> 06:21.600
case, sometimes there won't be any particular aspect and then it will be just kind of generic

06:21.600 --> 06:25.240
collection particular aspect, that's then for the single phenomenon of the body in this

06:25.240 --> 06:29.240
experience as a whole.

06:29.240 --> 06:42.200
So, if, if a person wants to practice calming down the body as a meditation, basically,

06:42.200 --> 06:52.240
what initially, the most important thing would be to not allow himself, to, to descend

06:52.240 --> 06:59.880
onto like particular aspects of the body, just stay with the mental thought of calming down

06:59.880 --> 07:05.720
the body, because again, that's all it, it doesn't, you don't need more than that, calming

07:05.720 --> 07:10.600
down the body results in calmedness, then obviously the mind needs more, wants more, doesn't

07:10.600 --> 07:12.680
mean more, wants more, wants to say, what is it?

07:12.680 --> 07:17.880
Well, exactly, wants to designate it in the, in the term, that it's used, and those terms

07:17.880 --> 07:23.120
are not subtle enough to designate the phenomenon of calming down the body as a phenomenon, as

07:23.120 --> 07:27.880
a general phenomenon, they're just not subtle enough, so as I said before, instead of then

07:27.880 --> 07:33.840
coursing up, so to speak, how the body feels and trying to pin it down and go into sensations

07:33.840 --> 07:38.080
or whatever else, you should actually define those designations you're trying to designate

07:38.080 --> 07:47.400
that general feeling, sorry, general phenomenon of the body as a whole, it begins to sound

07:47.400 --> 07:50.560
abstract, but that's, you know, whenever you read like in the sutras, when the Buddha

07:50.560 --> 07:54.680
speaks about meditation and perception of light or this, yeah, people, people lose it,

07:54.680 --> 08:02.600
they can't start on the same, but in this particular instance, basically, all you have

08:02.600 --> 08:07.960
to do is just remember that you have no choice but have your body right there and then,

08:07.960 --> 08:16.320
okay, learn how to relax without ending up thinking particular things, particular aspects

08:16.320 --> 08:22.120
about the body, just think about calming down, what does that mean, as a phenomenon, calming

08:22.120 --> 08:28.880
down, how is that done, not even specifically regarding body, just if, just, I tell you,

08:28.880 --> 08:38.120
as an external person, as another to you, I tell you, I, after, and a designation calmed

08:38.120 --> 08:49.720
down, so you do have a degree of, of, of meaning in regard to that designation, my not

08:49.720 --> 08:54.840
correspond 100% to what I regard calming down is, but certainly enough that we are able

08:54.840 --> 09:02.600
to talk and discuss it and communicate, to an extent, but there's a thing, for yourself

09:02.600 --> 09:09.880
then, you can take up that designation calmed down and see how far you can take it, without,

09:09.880 --> 09:16.000
you know, forming into some psychological explanations and things that go, no, no, it

09:16.000 --> 09:21.160
is this, so it might be that, no, and just, just for you, in your own terms, without

09:21.160 --> 09:29.360
resorting to anything external, an act of calming down, can you do it anytime, can you do anything,

09:29.360 --> 09:35.880
what is it basically, do you discern, do you see, because I think, I think it will be

09:35.880 --> 09:41.440
a mistake if I start imagining calmed things, yeah, yeah, no, no, that's again, that's

09:41.440 --> 09:47.320
like basically, trying to induce the calmedness to doing things that you think might actually

09:47.320 --> 09:53.840
result in it, and they sometimes might, but not for the reasons you think, they would,

09:53.840 --> 10:03.600
but an image of, say, an image might arise in the mind due to the fact that I have the

10:03.600 --> 10:11.560
intention to become, like I might have a, yeah, yeah, but that, because your concern is

10:11.560 --> 10:16.240
not in regard to that image, but it's in regard to intention to become, then those

10:16.240 --> 10:29.560
images you can second it, so things like, it's just, you're just talking about, at the

10:29.560 --> 10:37.360
edge, or, let's say, just like anger, I mean, you, you, you're overcome with anger, and

10:37.360 --> 10:45.440
your body is really in a state shaking, whatever, not shouting, but just this anger, so intention

10:45.440 --> 10:55.440
non-anger, you need to, you need to establish that, but it's quite, which is quite difficult

10:55.440 --> 11:01.000
to constate, I mean, what it is, it is basically, the only reason you were able to, what,

11:01.000 --> 11:05.560
the only reason one was able to get so angry in a, in a state of, you know, being shaken

11:05.560 --> 11:12.600
by anger and so on, is because the intention of non-anger hasn't really been developed,

11:12.600 --> 11:17.080
so at that time, all you have to do is just gr, your teeth and, and, and, and, and you,

11:17.080 --> 11:21.800
and all act upon that intention, and then when you're not that angry, practice intention

11:21.800 --> 11:27.760
non-anger, practice of intention of, uh, dispelling the, you know, kind of, looming anger or

11:27.760 --> 11:32.160
looming bad mood and so on, but it's, it's seeing it at its very early stages, so to

11:32.160 --> 11:36.240
speak, right, discerning it, and then training in regard to that, and then it will never

11:36.240 --> 11:41.160
come to that fully blown anger where you're like, you know what you're doing, your resistance

11:41.160 --> 11:48.680
resistance, yeah, it starts with resistance, starts with aversion and then you just, you,

11:48.680 --> 11:52.640
you don't look at it, you know it, you turn a blind eye, you give into it because it's,

11:52.640 --> 11:57.000
oh, well, it's not, I'm not as angry, so it's okay and whatever else, but then it ends

11:57.000 --> 12:00.760
up being accumulated and then eventually you get varying, you're nothing, always some

12:00.760 --> 12:07.240
silly things, just they just become kind of, uh, an excuse to let the whole, the whole

12:07.240 --> 12:15.160
thing out, you're always aware by the way, people can never be like, completely, oh yeah,

12:15.160 --> 12:18.680
the saying you know what, you always know what you're doing, because anger or the same

12:18.680 --> 12:24.320
with lust, you know, as powerful as they can get, they're always rooted in bad faith,

12:24.320 --> 12:29.800
which means you always know what you're doing, but you're coming to get up, you know, you

12:29.800 --> 12:33.600
don't get me, you're just not recognizing that you are, well no, you refuse basically

12:33.600 --> 12:37.760
to, just, you, you refuse to, yeah, you refuse to look at the fact that you know what

12:37.760 --> 12:43.760
you're doing and then you just let that, that built up anger or built up lust go, you just

12:43.760 --> 12:50.000
go, go with it, because it, yeah, it sounds, it's mindfulness in a way like the knowing that

12:50.000 --> 12:57.640
you are aware of something, yeah, admitting to yourself, yeah, that's my mindfulness feeds

12:57.640 --> 13:17.200
authentic attitude, attitude of not, it's basically an attitude of non-self deception.

13:17.200 --> 13:22.240
And then another thing, maybe it's probably, probably useful to mention, back on to meditation

13:22.240 --> 13:26.680
if you just practice the intention of calming down the body in general or relaxing, but

13:26.680 --> 13:32.160
everyone will call it, it's important to know that then, yeah, you might start feeling

13:32.160 --> 13:37.120
your body differently, because, you know, you've been, you've been cultivating intention

13:37.120 --> 13:44.120
coming and then your body might just start feeling, whatever, light or, or, or just, well

13:44.120 --> 13:49.440
I'm like, oh, I don't feel my body anymore, but that's the thing, that's all relative

13:49.440 --> 13:52.000
to your day to day life, how you used to feeling your body.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.200
So it's not actually any accomplishment in itself, to like feel your body, I don't

13:57.200 --> 14:02.320
know, like light, light cloud or whatever else, it's all a novelty just in regard to how

14:02.320 --> 14:04.840
you're used to feeling your body.

14:04.840 --> 14:10.360
And that's all fine, as long as you don't then become sort of too concerned, to obsess

14:10.360 --> 14:13.760
too keen on having your body felt like that all the time.

14:13.760 --> 14:18.640
That's again falling down onto particular and forgetting that it was about intention to

14:18.640 --> 14:20.560
just calm down the body.

14:20.560 --> 14:26.440
Now, what that intention results in, it's all secondary and you do not care about that.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.120
So sometimes you can be very calm and your body will feel very normal, you won't feel

14:30.120 --> 14:37.000
any light, you know, whatever, tingling, tingling, sensation, I don't know, but basically

14:37.000 --> 14:40.320
how people, I don't know how people would describe it, but you know what I mean, when

14:40.320 --> 14:45.120
you relax your body and then, well, you might be struggling for words to describe it,

14:45.120 --> 14:51.040
because it becomes different to how you used to kind of perceive your body in your day-to-day

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
life.

14:52.040 --> 14:56.280
But, no matter how ambiguously you might be perceiving your body at the time as a result

14:56.280 --> 14:59.840
of that coming down, that's irrelevant, there was never the goal.

14:59.840 --> 15:06.440
The goal is not to actually feel or perceive these certain ways the body can be felt or

15:06.440 --> 15:08.440
perceived.

15:08.440 --> 15:14.840
It's about recognizing this certain and cultivating intention to calm down the phenomenon

15:14.840 --> 15:19.800
of body, to calm down the nature of body.

15:19.800 --> 15:32.400
You see when you're doing this, practicing these kind of intentions and then seeing, noticing

15:32.400 --> 15:37.200
the results of these intentions, I can't, I actually can't body, whatever particular

15:37.200 --> 15:38.200
things happen.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.680
Can you get a bit greed?

15:41.680 --> 15:47.960
Well, no, well, yeah, imagine me, but I always thought I'd just think about, so I had to

15:47.960 --> 15:54.040
think about the principle that's happening, yes, that is, the terms is, and it was not this

15:54.040 --> 15:55.040
world.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.120
Yeah, be happy, you know, the other particular things might be happy.

15:58.120 --> 16:03.080
It's just, it's basically just another step in a course of developing your mind.

16:03.080 --> 16:09.640
So, you study your mind in regard to recognizing intention to calm down, calming down the

16:09.640 --> 16:10.640
body.

16:10.640 --> 16:16.040
Now, the pleasant results as a result of that, now you have to train your mind in regard

16:16.040 --> 16:20.320
to them, because now they're putting you a bit too much, now you want to always have

16:20.320 --> 16:24.480
that calm body and never, no, that calm body wasn't yours to begin with.

16:24.480 --> 16:33.240
Intention was, well, even intention wasn't yours, because that intention would be incernable,

16:33.240 --> 16:40.280
inc disernable, I don't know where this world is, but well, it would be impossible to discern

16:40.280 --> 16:49.040
if that body was not already there, so because that body pertains, sorry, because that intention

16:49.040 --> 16:54.120
pertains to that body, that's what, every intention is mental, but because it pertains

16:54.120 --> 17:01.400
to the body in its nature, in regard to the body, it's a bodily intention, but every

17:01.400 --> 17:09.000
intention manifests on the life of the mind, but it's a bodily intention, so the body

17:09.000 --> 17:14.240
has a possibility to be calm, so all you're doing, you're attending possibility of calm

17:14.240 --> 17:19.280
in regard to body, and that's a bodily intention of calm down.

17:19.280 --> 17:23.680
You are, there is no subject there that it's actually producing that intention towards

17:23.680 --> 17:29.720
this external body, or rather that, which is the subject producing the intention in regard

17:29.720 --> 17:34.120
to external body, that subject also belongs to that external body through that intention,

17:34.120 --> 17:44.440
thus it's not really subject, because it's the comms of body, the intention to calm,

17:44.440 --> 17:50.320
totally in regard to body and the nature of body, and that subject that inevitably appears

17:50.320 --> 17:55.960
for protugina in regard to that body, it's there, it's like a counterpart, a negative,

17:55.960 --> 17:59.520
sort of phenomenon in regard to the whole thing, and you don't have to worry about it in

17:59.520 --> 18:05.000
terms of trying to abolish it, or remove it, that's impossible, you actually have to

18:05.000 --> 18:09.320
acknowledge it, and then stop regarding it as yours, and that's it, that's all you

18:09.320 --> 18:14.000
take, and by not regarding it as yours, that subject will cease to be the center of your

18:14.000 --> 18:19.160
experience, becomes the other side, it's not matter, it just becomes an individual arising

18:19.160 --> 18:24.240
and ceasing in the same way, pancha, pancha, kanga rises and ceases, until they completely

18:24.240 --> 18:26.840
break apart and part in the body, that's it.

18:26.840 --> 18:36.320
What about awareness, this attention being paid to, certain things like that, I'm recognising

18:36.320 --> 18:37.320
me.

18:37.320 --> 18:43.400
Well, the awareness in itself, it's, you can't descend that, there's not such thing

18:43.400 --> 18:49.800
as awareness, the thing is, you can say, oh, pure awareness, but you fail to see that

18:49.800 --> 18:55.440
your designation, the very words you used as pure awareness stands for the matter in

18:55.440 --> 19:00.320
regard to which you're aware, thus there is no pure awareness as such, because if there

19:00.320 --> 19:04.440
were, well, you wouldn't be able to utter it, you wouldn't be able to discern it, and

19:04.440 --> 19:06.520
in that way, it means you can't be.

19:06.520 --> 19:16.720
There is the noticing of that, also present with other particular things like the matter.

19:16.720 --> 19:23.360
Sure, you can discern that, but you can't, in the same sense with the said, you can't

19:23.360 --> 19:28.040
separate feelings, perception, intention, they're conjuring, they're not disjointed, you

19:28.040 --> 19:33.800
don't want an exam yet, so that's all I'm pointing out, basically, yeah, you can say

19:33.800 --> 19:38.720
there is awareness in regard to it, and there is, there is noticing of it, but just make

19:38.720 --> 19:44.920
sure you don't mystify it, that it doesn't become an emptied in itself of pure noticing,

19:44.920 --> 19:49.680
pure awareness, justine awareness, all sorts of terms you might end up using.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.280
I mean, you have to see it in the context.

19:52.280 --> 19:55.720
So no, you just have to discern, because it's always in the context, you don't have to

19:55.720 --> 20:01.080
see it, it is always in the context, so you just have to actually find it in that context,

20:01.080 --> 20:05.320
in the context that it has a reason, and that's the thing, because you might recognize in

20:05.320 --> 20:10.480
the context once or twice, and then you develop a view that this thing is always in the context,

20:10.480 --> 20:15.120
and then you put the context over the, actually, already, a reason context, and even if that

20:15.120 --> 20:19.240
is the same context, the fact that you are putting it over means you're assuming it, and

20:19.240 --> 20:24.160
that's the wrong thing to do, even if you're assuming it rightly.

20:24.160 --> 20:28.280
So eventually you want to stop assuming any context and just be discerning the reason

20:28.280 --> 20:36.480
context.

20:36.480 --> 20:40.440
And that, that count again, by knowing that that context is always there, you know, ah,

20:40.440 --> 20:48.520
it's just a question of time with me discerning it, if that's how you look at it.

20:48.520 --> 20:56.960
And you can discern it by learning how to see it, so to speak, not by writing it with

20:56.960 --> 21:02.280
your own terms, but actually reading it, the way it has a reason, but in order to

21:02.280 --> 21:06.560
read it, you have to know how, you know, to know how it's written, so to speak, to learn

21:06.560 --> 21:10.760
their language, and their language is nothing other than what I said before, it's basically

21:10.760 --> 21:15.320
training your mind in, in, well, when you become a subtler, then the designation that you

21:15.320 --> 21:22.160
used to, ah, what you used to have, you used to entertain in regard to these, these things

21:22.160 --> 21:23.360
they will pertain to the mind.

21:23.360 --> 21:29.920
So for example, many people wouldn't say that their thoughts exist, because for them they

21:29.920 --> 21:34.200
are used to, for them, for them, the measure of existence is what they, what they are so

21:34.200 --> 21:38.440
used to, so entrenching, that they get through the senses.

21:38.440 --> 21:42.800
So then their thoughts are just these, well, I mean, but they fail to see that's already

21:42.800 --> 21:46.640
contradiction, because just by saying, oh my thoughts don't really exist, you would designate

21:46.640 --> 21:50.400
that very thing, that then you deny to be existing, why?

21:50.400 --> 21:57.400
Because for you, Bava existence has been quite sort of charged up, brought up, far

21:57.400 --> 22:02.120
out, whereby now pertains to the just senses and the, the, the, the palpable aspects of

22:02.120 --> 22:04.280
your five senses.

22:04.280 --> 22:08.480
That's how Bava grows, Bava accumulates, you know, it's not, it's not a static thing,

22:08.480 --> 22:09.480
so to speak.

22:09.480 --> 22:13.640
It's not a nature, Bava, Bava existence exists, but for some people things can exist

22:13.640 --> 22:17.680
more, if they have more significance, if they have more weight, if there is more lust

22:17.680 --> 22:23.960
and aversion and delusion in regard to it, they proliferate, they accumulate, they get

22:23.960 --> 22:24.960
heavier.

22:24.960 --> 22:32.920
They just stop there, well, you just stop by recognizing that, oh, hold on, if my thoughts

22:32.920 --> 22:35.960
don't exist, how can I even think about it?

22:35.960 --> 22:40.840
So they exist just much subtler than things that you might grab with your hand or see with

22:40.840 --> 22:42.320
your eyes.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.640
And then you start recognizing what's in common then, what is in common to things that

22:45.640 --> 22:50.800
I can see with my eyes, things I can grab with my hand, and things I can think about.

22:50.800 --> 22:57.000
Well, it's, what is in common is that they actually, all of them are thorough, they're

22:57.000 --> 23:00.040
all mental images, they're all dumbness.

23:00.040 --> 23:04.400
Okay, there you go, you already got the nature of things.

23:04.400 --> 23:09.120
That nature of things is to appear as an image, to rise on its own.

23:09.120 --> 23:12.680
And then you recognize, yeah, that is what comes first, not the fact that I'm holding

23:12.680 --> 23:13.680
it in my hand.

23:13.680 --> 23:18.960
I'm only able to hold this thing in my hand is because there was already a mental image

23:18.960 --> 23:22.960
of a hand, things to be held, a sense, a sense object.

23:22.960 --> 23:28.160
All of that was already meant, that's why the senses would not operate if the mind is

23:28.160 --> 23:34.480
not, you know, the range, sort of, if the mind is not in control of them, obviously the

23:34.480 --> 23:37.480
mind is not in control because people don't practice restraint.

23:37.480 --> 23:48.200
But they do meet in mind, in mind as a final and first, say, mind comes first.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.840
So then it just comes down to repetition of that recognition of what these damas are.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.960
Okay, this is an object, but again, there you go, you're designated as an object, which

23:57.960 --> 23:58.960
is a mental image.

23:58.960 --> 24:05.040
The whole designation, so everything becomes recognized because everything already is a

24:05.040 --> 24:06.040
mental image.

24:06.040 --> 24:09.000
A mental image that pertains to the senses, a mental image that pertains to a mental

24:09.000 --> 24:20.160
image, that's the mind.

24:20.160 --> 24:25.200
And the more you practice that, the more your mind withdraws from the threshold of being

24:25.200 --> 24:32.200
there was set far out in the sense world because you recognize, you just fade away because

24:32.200 --> 24:39.200
now the mind recognizes more, greater nature of it.

24:39.200 --> 24:50.880
Over, but it's bound to cease, cease, well, that's when the mind cease to be established

24:50.880 --> 24:57.520
upon anything, so then you do have things arising and ceasing but they don't really exist

24:57.520 --> 25:05.800
because existence, power, it's that significance, charge with that significance of mind, for

25:05.800 --> 25:12.680
me, significance of lust, aversion, or delusion, so you remove that, and then you can say

25:12.680 --> 25:17.600
you just have mirror rising and you're ceasing but they don't exist.

25:17.600 --> 25:25.160
That's again, I think, well, that's what I brought about in that I say appearance is an

25:25.160 --> 25:31.640
existence, for particular, but basically let's say that you can't have existence without

25:31.640 --> 25:40.080
appearance, but you can have appearance without existence, but obviously most of the people

25:40.080 --> 25:46.840
who are far down at the end of existence and they look back all the seeds existence,

25:46.840 --> 25:50.840
so for them appearance existence is the same, but if you actually start walking up, but

25:50.840 --> 25:54.840
reversing that thing, there would be a point where you went across and there it was not,

25:54.840 --> 25:57.840
things appear and they don't exist anymore.

25:57.840 --> 26:05.600
There's kind of no weight to it, yeah, exactly, you're drained, dead, you know, with a root

26:05.600 --> 26:11.800
cut off like a palm stump, so the palm stump is still there appearing but instead it's not

26:11.800 --> 26:17.160
charged anymore, it's not proliferating anymore, but it doesn't reduce feelings anymore,

26:17.160 --> 26:23.560
it cannot be the cause of suffering anymore, it's just done, cut off.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.280
And even that would break apart eventually, for another ambient appearance breaks apart

26:27.280 --> 26:33.360
when the idea is break apart and that's it, it doesn't re-emerge, for that very reason,

26:33.360 --> 26:38.960
you re-emerge because of that charge in regard to appearance remaining, even at the time

26:38.960 --> 26:52.960
of death, but you remove the significance of mind, the personality, the self, the all of

26:52.960 --> 27:02.960
those things come from that very same charge of existence, weight, weight to it.

27:02.960 --> 27:08.960
And again, you can actually, you can arrive at that by just, what I said, you can say,

27:08.960 --> 27:14.160
sure, everything exists, means everything, well everything affects you in a way, everything

27:14.160 --> 27:23.760
has a certain significance to you, why, because you take yourself to be, you are, I am.

27:23.760 --> 27:29.520
So all of that, all of that existence, what does it have in common then?

27:29.520 --> 27:33.320
The essence of the sense of drinks, of the senses, of the sense pleasures, existence of

27:33.320 --> 27:36.840
the thoughts, abstract thoughts, imaginary thoughts, for me.

27:36.840 --> 27:42.040
Well, for you, well, what it has in common is it appears as a mental image.

27:42.040 --> 27:46.800
And then yeah, that mental image is affected with a parasite that kind of makes you think

27:46.800 --> 27:50.960
it's for you, thus I must be.

27:50.960 --> 27:56.680
But obviously you can undo that, only once you first acknowledge it as a mental image.

27:56.680 --> 28:00.080
And then mental image is not in your head, then mental image is right there where the

28:00.080 --> 28:01.080
things are.

28:01.080 --> 28:06.680
So the distance, saying looking at the other side of the valley on that hill over there,

28:06.680 --> 28:08.960
mental image is right there, there, out there.

28:08.960 --> 28:13.960
But then saying out there, that's another mental image, so the whole space, it's a mental,

28:13.960 --> 28:18.160
so in the sense, I mean, it's probably not the best way to call mental image because

28:18.160 --> 28:22.480
for most of the people, if we'd imply, it's only in my head, and then we'll be like

28:22.480 --> 28:27.800
form of idealism, saying it's only in my mind, no, your mind is not yours to begin with,

28:27.800 --> 28:35.560
which means your mind is out there with things, and you are not there.

28:35.560 --> 28:41.160
So you can just say an image, or you can just say a dhamma, or a thought.

28:41.160 --> 28:46.800
But again, thought already has connotation for many people, as opposed to the senses.

28:46.800 --> 28:51.040
Oh, this is the real world, and then this is the world of my thoughts.

28:51.040 --> 28:57.080
But whether it's a thought, whether it's the real world, what they have, in common, they

28:57.080 --> 29:01.640
have a common, in common to appear as an image.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.120
As a phenomenon.

29:03.120 --> 29:09.240
But now obviously, with Europeans saying phenomenon, ah, it's just philosophy, it's just some

29:09.240 --> 29:14.840
way philosophy we don't, you know, it's not to call it whatever you want, but phenomenon

29:14.840 --> 29:23.520
would be the most, well, it would be the most accurate, actually, designation for it

29:23.520 --> 29:31.680
to appear, as an nature to appear, that's it, everything as an nature to appear.

29:31.680 --> 29:41.560
Even the most abstract and big use, impossible to define, thoughts, they appear as such.

29:41.560 --> 29:47.560
So then, when you start discerning the appearance within existence, existence would become redundant,

29:47.560 --> 29:48.560
eventually.

29:48.560 --> 29:52.840
Everything becomes equal in that sense.

29:52.840 --> 29:57.160
In an emotional sense, yes, nothing is what, yeah, that's why I don't think it's always

29:57.160 --> 30:05.760
a piece, immovable, there's no like, I mean, there are, ah, inherent significances, you

30:05.760 --> 30:11.520
know, that still stays, so like, you, we wouldn't start using, you know, ah, I've

30:11.520 --> 30:18.400
come up to, to sweep the leaves, because that's not the significance of the cup.

30:18.400 --> 30:24.840
But now these significances would be, ah, implying, would it, well, sorry, it would contain

30:24.840 --> 30:30.600
any more, any emotional significance of my cup, my dear cup, or my lovely broom, I really

30:30.600 --> 30:35.360
like this broom to be really practical, or even before you, it won't be yours, so it

30:35.360 --> 30:40.560
would be a cup for drinking, broom for sweeping, I mean, if you want to mess about, you can

30:40.560 --> 30:46.400
just try sweeping leaves with a cup, but it would be ridiculous, and it wouldn't work.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.800
But then again, it would be an intention to try something ridiculous, but even that

30:50.800 --> 30:52.960
wouldn't be for you.

30:52.960 --> 30:58.240
So in that sense, you would not be affected by any of it, and you certainly wouldn't

30:58.240 --> 31:05.480
be able to feel any, any suffering or pressure of any feeling in regard to it.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.840
But doesn't mean your mind would be caught blank or something, no, everything stays the

31:08.840 --> 31:14.600
same, you just don't feel anything in regard to it anymore, but it doesn't mean that you

31:14.600 --> 31:18.760
negate or destroy or ignore significance of things.

31:18.760 --> 31:24.560
That's why our hands were not recognized by ordinary people, external, sometimes they

31:24.560 --> 31:30.160
look worse, they behavior, or things they would say.

31:30.160 --> 31:45.160
So since we're talking about existence, father, father, if you're just saying assumption

31:45.160 --> 31:58.000
determinants, father, that's the cause of it, and not based on the extent of your assumption

31:58.000 --> 32:02.680
that's how far father will be established.

32:02.680 --> 32:06.320
The assumption being assumption?

32:06.320 --> 32:11.920
Yeah, this is not seeing it as LFPS first of all.

32:11.920 --> 32:18.880
Well yeah, yeah, I mean assumption basically, you take it to be something without actually

32:18.880 --> 32:24.480
knowing whether there is that what you take it to be.

32:24.480 --> 32:33.120
So assuming a context, which you said before, there is a context of an original experience,

32:33.120 --> 32:39.760
but then you can also assume the context of an original experience.

32:39.760 --> 32:45.560
And for you at the time, because you assume it is the real context, it doesn't correspond

32:45.560 --> 32:51.400
to the actual context of the original experience, but because all you have is your assumption

32:51.400 --> 32:55.280
of that context, it is what it is, it is that.

32:55.280 --> 33:03.440
That's why once you undo the assumption, you can't arise again, because you can only

33:03.440 --> 33:11.240
arise when you take things that are faced with, when you don't really know if it is like

33:11.240 --> 33:12.240
that or not.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.480
Once you know that it is like that or not, you can't then, okay, now I assume that it

33:16.480 --> 33:17.720
is this.

33:17.720 --> 33:28.520
Here is basically assumption, it is taking a stand in regard to anything without actually

33:28.520 --> 33:35.280
knowing whether that stand is right or not.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.520
And that goes to very subtle levels, so you assume assumption in regard to senses.

33:39.520 --> 33:45.200
And the fundamental assumption, the things are for you, the things are yours, and you don't

33:45.200 --> 33:49.480
have to worry about trying to chase this and just start with that fundamental assumption

33:49.480 --> 33:53.760
and if you don't do all of the other assumptions, assumption, sensuality and use and everything

33:53.760 --> 33:54.760
else.

33:54.760 --> 34:01.360
Assumption of me, because you look, okay, well now you can actually ask that anybody, okay,

34:01.360 --> 34:07.680
so what is that you, where are you, who are you, what is it, and you wouldn't, but then

34:07.680 --> 34:13.000
there is a very strong notion of me, and that notion is real because that assumption of

34:13.000 --> 34:20.600
me has been never questioned, never challenged, never discerned, so then you did really develop

34:20.600 --> 34:31.360
a sense of me based on constantly assuming that things are for you.

34:31.360 --> 34:35.920
So just stop assuming that things are for you, and then the assumption of me will fade

34:35.920 --> 34:39.760
because you won't be feeling it anymore.

34:39.760 --> 34:51.560
What about this, you know, people ask you, what is myself, and it says, you know, why

34:51.560 --> 34:55.080
are questions about self and the world, and answerable?

34:55.080 --> 34:59.760
Well, the question is just asked, why is it, because it implies that there is actually

34:59.760 --> 35:01.120
something that is yourself.

35:01.120 --> 35:07.320
You say, what is myself means, yeah, so we both agree that there is yourself and I

35:07.320 --> 35:13.640
just ask me what it is, but that's a wrong question because we don't agree that there

35:13.640 --> 35:15.120
is yourself, I don't agree.

35:15.120 --> 35:20.000
So if you ask me that question, I'm not going to answer it in a way that would just sort

35:20.000 --> 35:24.760
of make you think you were right to ask it in the first place, and you were not right

35:24.760 --> 35:29.400
to ask it in the first place because that question assumes the sense of self.

35:29.400 --> 35:33.400
It doesn't question, hold on, is there a sense of self?

35:33.400 --> 35:37.240
Am I wrong in thinking that I am, you don't ask that, you ask, what is myself?

35:37.240 --> 35:41.560
So you already take for granted, there is yourself, so now you just need to know what

35:41.560 --> 35:42.560
it is.

35:42.560 --> 35:47.360
Which is kind of funny, because it's like you really know what it is, they are ready for

35:47.360 --> 35:48.360
yourself.

35:48.360 --> 35:53.320
Well, exactly, that's why the Buddha would be silent, or replying, you know, what seemingly

35:53.320 --> 36:00.440
unrelated manner, saying describing, but it's not valid, describing the, or the dependent

36:00.440 --> 36:14.840
origination.

36:14.840 --> 36:21.320
Because if you were to see that again, things arise on their own, they manifest, the nature

36:21.320 --> 36:27.760
is to be manifest there, and you're not saying that, anything, your senses, your thoughts,

36:27.760 --> 36:32.920
you already find there, or you can do, you can intend to talk for it, you can, you know,

36:32.920 --> 36:38.160
you can pursue it, you can build your whole life, but fundamentally your senses and things

36:38.160 --> 36:43.880
in that you got to your senses, they're just there, you just use them, and you certainly

36:43.880 --> 36:52.800
have no access to, no reason of you into where they came from, or even just asking where,

36:52.800 --> 36:57.560
even the assumption that they came from somewhere doesn't even, even doesn't apply to them,

36:57.560 --> 37:02.600
they're just given, and then they go, when you die basically.

37:02.600 --> 37:07.120
So just recognizing that, that they're inaccessible, the only thing you can do is like secondarily

37:07.120 --> 37:13.720
use them, means they can't really be yours, because if it's yours, you would have it.

37:13.720 --> 37:18.400
That's why it's often in the city, like a borrowed, borrowed goal, or jewelry, it's not

37:18.400 --> 37:22.720
yours, it's gonna be, and you know, like everybody knows they'll die, everybody knows

37:22.720 --> 37:29.600
the senses will fall apart, yet you still go ahead and use it as if it belongs to you.

37:29.600 --> 37:34.520
So what you have to do is remove that sense of belonging in regard to things that you're

37:34.520 --> 37:40.720
using, and what are the things that you're using, your eyes, your nose, your ears, your

37:40.720 --> 37:46.520
mind basically, all of the senses and your mind, that was in that sort of, when they, when

37:46.520 --> 37:52.680
they were said, it's because people take that which belongs to Mata, Mata does what he wants

37:52.680 --> 37:54.880
with them, and account of it.

37:54.880 --> 38:00.440
What are the things that belong to Mata, its eyes and forms, ears and sounds, basically,

38:00.440 --> 38:05.960
is pretty much nothing else in between, so everything belongs to Mata, and the problem

38:05.960 --> 38:12.040
is not you using it, like you can use it wearily, like the, the, the, the, the bait, the

38:12.040 --> 38:20.600
problem is, you're appropriating it, as you're taking it to be yours, so you're appropriating

38:20.600 --> 38:25.320
it, you're using Mata actually, well through using, you end up appropriating it, because

38:25.320 --> 38:34.960
you're using it wearily, it has this using work, what do you mean, well, because it's the

38:34.960 --> 38:41.520
intention to do something, well using works by, by doing it without taking it to be

38:41.520 --> 38:42.520
yours.

38:42.520 --> 38:51.120
But when you cut things up, when you slice them apart, you see there's intention, there's

38:51.120 --> 38:59.560
any tension there, to, to use something, to attend to something, okay, and so on, but

38:59.560 --> 39:08.280
there's no, there's no station in position where I sit, where I am, the self, I can, I'll

39:08.280 --> 39:14.720
use my intention, I'll use my body, you know, there is no, there is no station in position,

39:14.720 --> 39:21.880
but, because people do regard their intentions as yours, as theirs, as belonging to them,

39:21.880 --> 39:28.200
they generate, as a result of that, there is a sense of self, there is a sense of center,

39:28.200 --> 39:34.040
there is a sense of me, and then you can then appropriate that center as well, so you

39:34.040 --> 39:40.200
might kind of pull out from all of these particular things, and you cannot mind, like putrogen

39:40.200 --> 39:46.440
it can be free from centrality, you let go of that, but still hold on to their self-use,

39:46.440 --> 39:47.440
sense of self.

39:47.440 --> 39:59.280
The sense of you could say in this rightful, what you can call it right for is the person,

39:59.280 --> 40:04.800
the guy, just the person, what about it?

40:04.800 --> 40:08.520
That's what you can call the sense is not free, well, that's how you can call it appropriate

40:08.520 --> 40:16.440
that center, stop regarding that center, you start seeing that center as depending upon

40:16.440 --> 40:24.400
things that are centered around it, it won't be your center anymore, that's why the Buddha

40:24.400 --> 40:30.160
said that was a king, my self-esteem, I can't remember the name, he said, well, would the

40:30.160 --> 40:37.800
king, a king, would a king, be determined as a king without his king's possessions, without

40:37.800 --> 40:42.320
his caste, without his queen, without his appointment, without all these things, without his ownership

40:42.320 --> 40:48.320
of the great armies, he wouldn't be a king, he might call himself a king, if he is delusional,

40:48.320 --> 40:54.080
he won't be a king, if nobody ever appointed him, he is not born in a family that appoints

40:54.080 --> 40:58.400
himself as king and then their offspring as king, that he appropriates externally, I am

40:58.400 --> 41:03.320
the king, he wouldn't be a king, so all of these possessions, the title, everything

41:03.320 --> 41:10.040
else, are the things that determine that center of me as a king, so you then start seeing

41:10.040 --> 41:17.840
all these things that you take it to be yours, as not yours, then you, you will fail, because

41:17.840 --> 41:23.440
it's not I am, therefore things are mine, it's because I take things to be mine, therefore

41:23.440 --> 41:30.320
I end up being, but that sense of remains, well, the center remains in a sense, but again,

41:30.320 --> 41:35.200
in a sense, in a sense, you can say appearance remains, but existence ceases, so that's

41:35.200 --> 41:39.680
only known once existence ceases, so once you let go of that center, you can say, you

41:39.680 --> 41:47.400
can see what sort of center remains, but it can be a very different sense of center than

41:47.400 --> 41:54.320
a sense of center that Patujana is used to, or not very different if he was a very wise

41:54.320 --> 42:02.680
and restrained Patujana and then he just needed, he had little dust in his eyes, he depends

42:02.680 --> 42:14.080
how far off center have you established your Patujana center, so that comes back to the

42:14.080 --> 42:38.560
center. Cool. But again, if all of this being existence phenomena, it's sort of feeling

42:38.560 --> 42:47.880
too much, just restart, and the first step is, why do you want to practice at all, to be

42:47.880 --> 42:55.680
free from suffering, and you can just revolve around that, why? Because becoming free from

42:55.680 --> 43:00.000
suffering frees you from sense itself, frees you from existence, frees you from all of

43:00.000 --> 43:05.440
it, so it's just different approaches, for different people obviously, some need to

43:05.440 --> 43:11.480
come from this angle, the others from that angle, but if it's just, you know, if you just

43:11.480 --> 43:16.600
can't help but have it, oh this is all abstract, I just can't get my head around it, you

43:16.600 --> 43:21.720
might not necessarily have to, but you will have to get your head around something else,

43:21.720 --> 43:27.080
maybe not on the same intellectual level, because not all people have the same faculties,

43:27.080 --> 43:34.240
but certainly there is no question of, oh, can I get this done with less effort? The

43:34.240 --> 43:39.000
same amount of effort needs to be, well, virtually the same, not completely the same, but almost

43:39.000 --> 43:44.880
the same amount of effort needs to be put in by every petitioner, just in regard to different

43:44.880 --> 43:48.880
things or a different approach, the effort of repetition, the effort of drilling, the

43:48.880 --> 43:56.880
effort of endurance, the effort of strength, but again, it's all done for the same goal,

43:56.880 --> 44:01.120
being free from suffering, being free from possibility to suffer, which is suffering,

44:01.120 --> 44:11.760
that's it, so might be my sense of self, my center, okay, why am I doing this, the

44:11.760 --> 44:15.720
brief free from suffering, understand the flow of the truth then, and that's it, and

44:15.720 --> 44:20.160
then you start discerning all the other things that Buddha was talking about within that principle,

44:20.160 --> 44:31.000
oh, you're going to have to look left and right from it, try there, why do you suffer?

44:31.000 --> 44:39.960
What is suffering, to what extent? When does this agreeable become suffering? Is this

44:39.960 --> 44:50.080
agreeable suffering? Can you have this agreeable without actually suffering on the contrary?

44:50.080 --> 44:57.160
Quite useful questions to contemplate on, because most people disagreeable, in the same

44:57.160 --> 45:01.480
sense, again, there you go, I just said, it's all the same, it revolves around the same principles,

45:01.480 --> 45:07.320
in the same sense I said, you can have appearance without resistance, but you can't have

45:07.320 --> 45:12.080
existence without appearance, you can have this agreeable without suffering, but you can't

45:12.080 --> 45:21.800
have suffering without this agreeable, you can't have suffering without this agreeable,

45:21.800 --> 45:28.920
you can't suffer if there's nothing disagreeable, but you can have this agreeable without suffering,

45:28.920 --> 45:35.640
so, and it's because you can't suffer without a disagreeable experience, that's where people

45:35.640 --> 45:41.040
by default assume, removing this agreeable means removing suffering, but that is always

45:41.040 --> 45:47.280
stepping it, that is going into the domain that doesn't belong to you, the domain of agreeable

45:47.280 --> 45:53.440
and disagreeable, things that just arise as agreeable and disagreeable, there's some use,

45:53.440 --> 45:58.680
suffering in regard to it is yours, so it's your attitude in regards to agreeable or disagreeable

45:58.680 --> 46:05.280
that's making you suffer, so whenever there is disagreeable, you suffer, because of your

46:05.280 --> 46:10.200
attitude in regard to disagreeable, so in that sense, it's the middle way, it's the middle

46:10.200 --> 46:14.800
way because you don't go and just remove disagreeable altogether, you can't, because you're

46:14.800 --> 46:22.160
not in control of that, you never were, you can't stop eyes from seeing ears from hearing

46:22.160 --> 46:28.440
mind from thinking, or, or, or, more certainly, you cannot order it, to only see pleasant things

46:28.440 --> 46:33.680
and hear pleasant things and think pleasant things impossible, why, because in a pleasant

46:33.680 --> 46:38.880
can be a source of, source of disagreeable, if you start thinking about more pleasant,

46:38.880 --> 46:43.080
which is, which is, you know, not that you're kind of experiencing, well, that's a disagreeable

46:43.080 --> 46:48.240
experience, you created a disagreeable discrepancy, and now you suffer in a country because you

46:48.240 --> 46:54.200
lost for more, what you have is far from enough, you used to be enough, but because the mind

46:54.200 --> 46:58.760
was under strain, you created discrepancy upon which you got established, and now you just

46:58.760 --> 47:06.400
create need, depend on more, and you become very unhappy, very, very affected by suffering,

47:06.400 --> 47:12.960
in regard to very pleasant experiences, so your, your attitude towards disagreeable,

47:12.960 --> 47:18.680
and agreeable, yeah, is what basically makes yourself, and that attitude is actually the

47:18.680 --> 47:33.360
craving, not wanting disagreeable and wanting, yeah, overstepping it, it's a changing

47:33.360 --> 47:39.840
the attitude to be, yeah, knowing, but first knowing that you, you should stop being concerned

47:39.840 --> 47:43.560
about the actual agreeable and disagreeable, so you don't go trying to change the circumstances,

47:43.560 --> 47:48.000
I mean, of course, if you live in a middle of a city, in a horrible environment, and you

47:48.000 --> 47:53.200
want to become an adult, well, you have to change those circumstances, but it's not what

47:53.200 --> 47:58.040
I'm talking about, but I'm talking about is if, I mean, somebody said something that

47:58.040 --> 48:06.040
upset you, you're responsible for the upset, you're not responsible for what's being said,

48:06.040 --> 48:11.920
so if you suffer, it's on you, why? because suffering is present when craving is present,

48:11.920 --> 48:17.160
craving in regard to agreeable and disagreeable, not, it's not that suffering is present when

48:17.160 --> 48:21.360
agreeable or disagreeable is present, no, you can have agreeable and disagreeable without

48:21.360 --> 48:29.360
actually suffering, at all, so somebody said something that upset you, default position

48:29.360 --> 48:35.160
response is to well, either get upset and say something back that will hurt them, or

48:35.160 --> 48:40.640
if perhaps you have been more restrained, then well, that's good in my talk, or wanting

48:40.640 --> 48:46.600
in their apology, you want to affect it on that external level where it came from, but

48:46.600 --> 48:50.920
actually you're not, you're, again, as I said, you're always stepping in, you're misplacing

48:50.920 --> 48:56.600
it, that was not the suffering to begin with, it was your attitude in regard to that,

48:56.600 --> 49:02.440
which has come your way in terms of somebody saying something, and the first thing you

49:02.440 --> 49:07.560
recognize is like, well, there's always going to be something disagreeable in the world,

49:07.560 --> 49:11.520
even if I get all of the people to be on my side, to agree with me, to always succinct

49:11.520 --> 49:17.520
phrases of me, something else will always be disagreeable, which means there's always

49:17.520 --> 49:23.280
something else that might come your way that you're not going to like, eventually, aging

49:23.280 --> 49:30.560
sickness and death, and that's it, and you know, there isn't a sugarcoating that, so

49:30.560 --> 49:37.640
you recognize it's inevitable, but then, again, see, oh my goodness, it's all depressing

49:37.640 --> 49:43.840
now, everything is inevitable in that sense, everything is just going to come to horrible

49:43.840 --> 49:49.160
disagreeable end, so you could see people falling into despair if they start thinking

49:49.160 --> 49:55.360
about it, and then imagine, well, imagine the extent of the Buddha's discovery there,

49:55.360 --> 50:02.640
within that, you manage to discern that none of that is actually caused for the pain that

50:02.640 --> 50:09.640
you feel, or you might feel for the suffering, none of that, so imagine that like seen through

50:09.640 --> 50:16.760
these just layers of identical glass, yet you start discerning them, without any external

50:16.760 --> 50:22.040
input, without he didn't have another Buddha's guidance, he saw it from the inside, which

50:22.040 --> 50:27.760
is what, which is a mirror, which is you know, that's why he's the Buddha, it's easier

50:27.760 --> 50:34.320
for us now, because we have it like lay down, pointed out, you know, outlined by the Buddha

50:34.320 --> 50:40.960
and I had other hands and so on, and the sutras, mainly, only, so you then, now you know

50:40.960 --> 50:51.920
what to look for from that inside, so that, so again, that's the whole point is

50:51.920 --> 50:55.840
basically, when you recognize, oh, wow, the freedom lies within that, right through the

50:55.840 --> 51:04.080
center of that, complete freedom, because the problem was never disagreeable, no matter

51:04.080 --> 51:08.800
how disagreeable it was, even if it was a high-rate order, so in your names and so on,

51:08.800 --> 51:12.440
that was never the issue, the issue was the fact that you were touched by it, and you were

51:12.440 --> 51:17.720
touched by it because you were picking it up, because you were touching it, there's a hot

51:17.720 --> 51:23.200
stove and you put a hand on it, always, and you don't know how to stop it, and then you

51:23.200 --> 51:27.680
start blaming the stove, and you want to try to remove it, and the bowl is a stove,

51:27.680 --> 51:35.560
but it's not yours, and you can't do it, okay, simply find it a bit, but basically, craving

51:35.560 --> 51:42.680
as a mental attitude is the cause, so simultaneously, and that's it, that's why it's part of it,

51:42.680 --> 51:52.840
it's simultaneous presence, simultaneous dependence, it's inconceivable to have duke present,

51:52.840 --> 52:00.280
duke a reason, if there is no, at the same time, to the same extent, tanha present, tanha

52:00.280 --> 52:06.200
a reason, absence of tanha, absence of duke, presence of tanha, presence of duke,

52:06.200 --> 52:14.320
could you have a, could you have a intention of non craving, yeah, that's what you guys

52:14.320 --> 52:22.760
mean, but not when there is no craving, because then that intention would be craving, intention

52:22.760 --> 52:30.280
of non craving, it has to be in regard to craving, when there is no craving, when there is

52:30.280 --> 52:36.440
no craving, you intending to not craving, would be craving, yeah, that's why how did you cross

52:36.440 --> 52:43.240
the shore, well, by not fighting the waves, by not kind of going backwards, and by not

52:43.240 --> 52:59.720
standing still, so at the time, you intend riding, but again, don't think, which I'm sure

52:59.720 --> 53:03.800
you would, and everybody would, including myself, when I first read it, that that's like

53:03.800 --> 53:09.080
you need to moment, like, catch the intention in the moment, and encounter it rightly, it's

53:09.080 --> 53:14.760
not like that, it's just basically recognizing the general intention, and then relinquishing

53:14.760 --> 53:23.480
it, and you can always recognize the general intention by being aware of duke, and that's

53:23.480 --> 53:28.280
it, so that's why suffering and freedom from suffering, that's all the Buddha teaches,

53:28.280 --> 53:31.000
because if there is presence of duke, you know there is craving, you don't need to look

53:31.000 --> 53:36.720
for it, how probably there isn't, how is it, no, I suffer, I mean, the craving is there,

53:36.720 --> 53:45.440
so how can I, so to speak, tune my attitude whereby I'm mis-disagreeable, I'm not suffering

53:45.440 --> 53:51.520
at all, not because I'm running away from disagreeable, not because I'm ignoring disagreeable,

53:51.520 --> 53:55.720
not because I'm psychologizing the disagreeable and explaining myself, you know, I was because

53:55.720 --> 54:00.600
my childhood with this or that, no, because I don't crave in regard to it, I don't fear

54:00.600 --> 54:07.840
the pain, I don't lost pleasure, means you don't crave, you don't overshoot, you don't

54:07.840 --> 54:14.640
step in, you don't run away, means you don't react in regard to agreeable or disagreeable,

54:14.640 --> 54:24.760
means you don't suffer, and again disagreeable, you don't want to do it, you don't want to

54:24.760 --> 54:30.360
do it, and again disagreeable and agreeable, it's not set in stone, can be, you know,

54:30.360 --> 54:35.440
can arise in different extents, so that's another thing, because you might, you might

54:35.440 --> 54:40.000
get used to a certain level of disagreeable and that ceases to cause you pain, suffering

54:40.000 --> 54:47.360
mentally, but then the level of disagreeable increases and then you start suffering again,

54:47.360 --> 54:51.520
you just, you know, training in regard to the extent of disagreeable, which is why you

54:51.520 --> 54:57.280
don't have to go and torture yourself, as some ascetics thought they would have to, so

54:57.280 --> 55:01.440
you're not training in regard to the extent of disagreeable, you're training in regard

55:01.440 --> 55:09.040
to the nature of disagreeable, and you stop feeling the nature of disagreeable, the

55:09.040 --> 55:14.200
extent becomes irrelevant, again to the point of high level, overestropping your names one

55:14.200 --> 55:20.320
by one with a blunt saw, and you still won't be suffering with very disagreeable, I'm

55:20.320 --> 55:25.520
just screaming disagreeable, but mentally you actually won't be feeling it or suffering

55:25.520 --> 55:50.800
on a contrary, you overcome death, you overcome death, if the atmosphere disagreeable.

55:50.800 --> 55:59.280
So as I was saying before, when puttu jena was statured by suffering, he suffers on a

55:59.280 --> 56:07.560
counter that as well, because he compromised it and he knows no escape, when it's sold

56:07.560 --> 56:14.720
to parna, or an area, he's statured by suffering, he doesn't suffer parna that, and then fully

56:14.720 --> 56:20.760
developed parna, an area that becomes another hand, he's not touched given in the first place.

56:20.760 --> 56:26.560
So for a so it's funny, he can suffer, but only to a certain extent, exactly, which is

56:26.560 --> 56:33.840
well, he can suffer to the extent of seven little grains of sand in comparison to the Himalayas,

56:33.840 --> 56:37.000
but obviously for him at the time that would be a lot of suffering, because that's all

56:37.000 --> 56:45.160
suffering he has, there's no limit to suffering in a way, like people can take mountains

56:45.160 --> 56:50.320
of it, or if there are no mountains, just a little grain, well again it's the suffering,

56:50.320 --> 56:54.960
it's going to feel like a little suffering will feel as much as big suffering, suffering

56:54.960 --> 57:01.360
is there, so for so the parna, the little suffering will be suffering, but again not, like

57:01.360 --> 57:07.520
if he were to remember how he used to suffer, of course he won't suffer, it's only quite

57:07.520 --> 57:10.360
a trivial matter, which is what gives even more confidence to the Buddha and the Dhamma

57:10.360 --> 57:14.680
and the practice he has, which is why it's a confirmed confidence, he knows it for himself,

57:14.680 --> 57:19.800
he can't suffer as much as before if he were wanted, but if he would just look then at

57:19.800 --> 57:26.160
the suffering that he still can experience, oh yeah, there is still work to be done, but

57:26.160 --> 57:32.320
not also the one who would, if the circumstances are right, and they don't get challenged

57:32.320 --> 57:37.960
often, they might be quite complacent, because it is quite an accomplishment getting the

57:37.960 --> 57:43.880
right view, again as the Buddha compared it to seven grains of sand in comparison to

57:43.880 --> 57:51.760
the Himalayas, that's how little suffering is left for somebody with a right view, but

57:51.760 --> 57:56.880
again, being complacent is an unwholesome state which means it should not be encouraged,

57:56.880 --> 58:01.320
and the Buddha never did, he said, like some of my disciples might be suffering, I'm

58:01.320 --> 58:07.160
saying I still go to them, and encourage them, and they're actually in a sense of urgency

58:07.160 --> 58:08.160
and so on, why?

58:08.160 --> 58:11.080
Because there is still work to be done, if there isn't work to be done, I wouldn't be

58:11.080 --> 58:21.720
telling them to do the work, so so the parna can still experience a degree of suffering

58:21.720 --> 58:28.880
in regard to disagreeable, even if he's careless, if he's not actively practicing or just

58:28.880 --> 58:35.560
using the other hundred, but he knows it, he can't deceive himself about it, which is what

58:35.560 --> 58:40.800
Petitian can do, as you are before, Petitian man almost certainly be experiencing suffering

58:40.800 --> 58:45.000
all the time, and that is very much the case, and that's what the said that, is because

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
the human life it's not solely constitute of pain, people get enamored with it, intoxicated

58:51.000 --> 58:56.400
with it, because it does have pleasures, but that's the thing, if Petitian is authentic

58:56.400 --> 59:02.400
he would recognize that, yeah, look, all the circumstances around in my work, my family,

59:02.400 --> 59:07.120
whatever else, it's all great, and I'm very, very happy, everything is going my way for

59:07.120 --> 59:12.120
a little effort, and that's a fact, you don't deny that, no, no, no, that is suffering,

59:12.120 --> 59:19.720
in a way it's not, it's very pleasant, but he also, if he's so aware of his pleasures,

59:19.720 --> 59:25.800
he should also be aware that that can change the next moment, misfortune, accident, anything

59:25.800 --> 59:31.480
like that, he's on life, so he needs to then recognize that the very foundations upon

59:31.480 --> 59:37.600
which his current happiness rests are inaccessible to him, he has no control over it, no saying

59:37.600 --> 59:45.440
it, can't even conceive that, so then that recognition is very unpleasant, even amidst

59:45.440 --> 59:47.960
all the happiness you have.

59:47.960 --> 59:56.160
Even that recognition, that would help him, not necessarily, he's fulfilling with anxiety,

59:56.160 --> 01:00:02.280
and that's a very deep existential pain, suffering, and people who experience that, as the

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:10.640
Buddha said, they have like two outcomes, search for the relief, and that's when it helps

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:16.120
him, he has enough wisdom, enough composure to go out, or just mental derangement, and

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:21.360
you know, start taking pills, and extreme antidepressants, or whatever else, because you

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:29.680
can't hack it, alcohol, or extreme destruction in terms of alcohol or whatever else, yeah.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.000
So he wouldn't necessarily help him, but it's certainly the prerequisite for him seeking

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:43.640
help, because that's it, you recognize, and you know, my experience was the same, there

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:50.640
was no misfortunes, nothing like that, quite actually comfortable, despite, you know,

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.400
what Serbia was going through, quite a comfortable life, very good job, no problems in any department

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:06.120
of life, but I recognize indeed, any department of life can be compromised at any given second,

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:13.600
not by you, by freak exit, by anything, and you cannot prevent it, that is very frightening,

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.080
and then again, that's the situation, he would say, you know, young men, whatever laymen,

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:26.320
recognizes, I am prey to suffering, I don't necessarily suffer, but the suffering might

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.520
be looming at the next moment, the next choice I make, the next thing I do, the result

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:38.480
for most people is freaking out, in anxiety, losing a grip, seeking, in very calmness, medical

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:44.880
help, checking down the pills, until they sometimes manage to forget about it, and move on,

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.960
cover enough enough that they are able to move on, or not, just become fully dependent,

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:56.960
and then lose, lose their mind completely, few other people who don't necessarily, for

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:05.640
maybe a bit stronger mentally, for them, recognition of that anxious sort of prospect

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:11.520
of, things can happen, and you won't be able to prevent it, and you won't be able to

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:18.920
not be affected by it, you are prey to suffering, suffering is a hunter, that you might, you

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.160
might come in its crosshairs, and then you recognize furthermore, oh, you will come in

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:30.440
its crosshairs, eventually, but most people don't have to wait to get, you know, get sick

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:36.000
and die, because you are attached to plenty of other things around you, when they change

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.320
you already be suffering, and that's the same nature, so you just start recognizing, yeah,

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:47.160
even if none of these things change, which is inconceivable, this life will come to an end

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.960
in time, so which means ultimately, it will result in that, so I'd better do something

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:59.760
about it, so recognition of that, of feeling like a prey, like a deer in a field, and you

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.800
know that a hunter's there, you can't see it, so then you can, I ignore the fact that

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.960
he might be there, and just pretend all of this grass is very tasty, and I'll just ignore

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:15.080
it, and enjoy it, while I can, before the hunter comes, oh, you'll think no, this grass

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:21.120
is useless to me, if I'm going to end up on a hunter's table, so I might just well

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:27.560
try and find a way out, and escape it, and that's when, you know, a young man goes forward

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:34.400
and comes out of faith, and so on, so basically, life can be very perfect, but recognition

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:42.880
of that life is not in your control, just that suffering, it's almost like everyone

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.640
somehow recognizes that's already, everybody, yeah, that's no, that's no, cover it up or

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.840
you start, cover it up, you don't cover it up, the whole life becomes an act of a cover

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.320
up, and I think I said that before recently, that's why people, that's where sensuality

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:04.000
and sensual pursuits are not often not optional for people, in a sense that their life has

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.740
been, has became a massive cover up, and now they fully is essentially dependent upon

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:14.880
sensual distraction, that's why I'm going to crash even harder when the senses start

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:22.000
to fail, and then death comes, but the point is basically, pursuing your desires as

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.720
if it's not like, oh, I'll do it, no, no, you have to, because those are the only means

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:33.720
of you floating, not sinking down, so you know, everybody knows it, every prospect,

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:40.400
that every given in of the desire, and every giving in towards the distraction, the core

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:50.040
reason of covering up the fact that you're not in control of the whole thing, it's present,

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:55.680
suffering, and that's happening, yeah, Sankara Dukka, everything is suffering, everything

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:14.200
can be a determination for your suffering, Sankara Dukka, for that reason, so it's only

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:25.760
Dukka that arises and Dukka that ceases, this is the right view, so it's Dukka that ceases,

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:34.440
there is only Dukka that arises and Dukka that ceases, it's ceasing and Dukka is, right

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.440
for you.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:44.520
So, this is what I said, putugina suffers on account of his own, on account of suffering,

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:49.200
so it's only suffering that arises and suffering is ceases and he doesn't suffer on account

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:58.120
of that, and he pursues it long enough, hard enough, he's become another hunt and then

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:09.200
there won't be any suffering arising anymore, again, as I said, you can't have suffering

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.480
without disagreeable, you can have disagreeable without suffering, but because you are at the

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.600
end of suffering, as putugina, you actually have to go through that suffering until eventually

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:23.640
you just reach, oh, there is only the nuisance left on account of this body, only disagreeable

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:27.440
things that can arise on account of the senses, but not all of the suffering has been abolished,

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:34.920
and that's all right, it's an other hunt becomes another one, it says, any sort of disagreeable

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.000
experience that can arise, it's going to be an account of these five aggregates until

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.680
they break apart, but he doesn't suffer on account of it, and then when they break apart

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.120
even that disagreeable, their little annoyance of the five aggregates, still arising and

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.120
ceasing will go.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:56.200
But for him, there's no suffering arises, no, so you first recognize the suffering, then

01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:01.000
you recognize the nature of suffering, then you recognize the escape in regard to that

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.400
suffering, you recognize how it ceases, then you recognize what to do in order for it

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.760
to see it all together, and then you start doing it, and then you can, then you stop suffering

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:20.520
on account of not knowing escape from a reason suffering, so you hold it, well, even more,

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.400
and then you pursue even that further, and then even that suffering ceases, and all that

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:31.000
is left, it's for an other hunt, nuisance and annoyance that can arise, all my account

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.560
of the five aggregates still, or these senses operating on their own, these animals yanking

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:42.760
left and right, but they can't pull you in, you know, when they, when, when, when,

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.480
Andrew, Andrew, Andrew, and I think it was also that, when they were at the palace with

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:56.120
him, when he went back home and father got his, his, well, former wives to dress up and

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.120
try and seduce him, and kind of basically harass him, and he, and he said that, oh, and

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.880
he was another hunt, and he was saying, oh, just stop harassing me with his sights, sisters,

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.320
and then they fainted because he called him sisters, and then father gave him a gold, he said,

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.560
better throw that in the river, because he's going to be a source of your great misfortune

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:18.600
holding onto it, so yeah, these sights become annoying and harassing, when your eyes, the

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:24.280
habit of the animals, the five sense animals, basically the stimuli of the five senses being

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.720
a respective animal, they just, you know, they, oh, I'm going to go there, this is my feeling

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:33.720
you're hungry, they can't pull you, but they can still, uh, disagreeable, can be disagreeable,

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.320
and during the body, bearing the body, bearing the illness, bearing the discomfort,

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:41.240
it's disagreeable, Arun is aware of it, but he doesn't suffer any surgery, he doesn't fear it,

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.920
oh, fear of disagreeable, then prevents him to do so, no, he does not have that, because he knows

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:51.320
whatever disagreeable arises will cease, before him, sort up on the nose, whatever suffering

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:57.560
when accounting disagreeable arises will cease, but Tugina doesn't know even that, whatever suffering

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.240
on accounting disagreeable that arises for Tugina, he suffers on accounting that twice,

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:07.880
on a, on another level, and there's a similarly of the, how was it, the two errors, man gets hit

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.520
by one error, and then he struck whether pain does it, and then he gets struck by another error

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:20.280
on account of that, and that doesn't happen to an Arya Savaka, to a noble, to noble disciple basically,

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:25.560
he's struck by one error of suffering, but he knows his cape, from that pain that has a reason

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.840
on account of that error, so he's not struck by the second error of panic and fear, and this

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:36.120
is struck, his cape is not understanding, his cape is fully understood, before that things,

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:43.320
that's why he became a sort of runner, so no matter how painful, how sufferable things arise,

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.600
he wants to suffer on account of that, and then for an hour, and then he pursues it fully,

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.760
then they won't even arise, then it will only be like disagreeable arising, agreeable arising,

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:59.160
here the Buddha says, oh, sometimes a person comes and asks him for the instruction,

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.040
he tells them what to do, then they go and do it, he says, that the target is pleased,

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.720
if he finds that agreeable, then another man comes, and the word teaches him for an hour,

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.600
he goes in this completely opposite, he says, the target is pleased, he finds that disagreeable,

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:21.080
they said, but neither of those accounts do make the target that suffer, or get upset,

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:26.280
or get elated, with great joy, because somebody is following, he is instruction,

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.520
no, yes, oh, this is agreeable, that's suitable, that's not suitable, that's disagreeable,

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:45.800
so I must say, these terms, I don't know if we go through all them, but the dhamma is

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.880
open-air, leading to bringing the earth, leading on, yeah, I just wrote down some translation,

01:10:53.880 --> 01:11:04.440
uh-huh, leading to bringing the earth, leading on, well it's basically, you need to see,

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:12.520
you know, if you know it, put it simply, in other words, you will develop the dhamma,

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:18.600
if you're trying to practice, but become so fun and then around, not by thinking you

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:25.640
need to do dhamma, but at the same time, knowing that you're still putugina, so understanding of

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:32.680
the dhamma leads you onwards, further or rather closer, and closer, and closer to the goal,

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:38.680
further or further away from being putugina, but it's not like, oh, I understood the dhamma,

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:45.480
and that's it, I keep my old ways of being putugina or whatever else, but I understood the dhamma,

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:51.960
that's not the dhamma then, because if you were to gain any understanding of the dhamma,

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.360
you would then recognize, oh, there is more, then you get the understanding of that more,

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:01.560
and then, oh, no, there is more, there is more, there is more, until the other hand says,

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:06.760
there is no more, everything has been completed, the task, you know, the burden has to be laid down,

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.600
there is no more, so it led him onwards until he reached the goal,

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:18.600
recognize suffering, sorry, you recognize suffering, and he fully freed himself from it,

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:24.040
so nature, because that's the thing, because again, you get, and there were different dhammas,

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.720
different teachings in the Buddha's day, and he said, well, not all dhamma actually felt it,

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:33.640
and why? Because, yeah, they would not be leading you to the final goal, or freedom,

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:39.320
so if your dhamma says, oh, understanding of this will free you from suffering,

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.000
then you understand that, but you're not free from suffering, that's either the wrong dhamma,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.760
or you haven't understood it, that's why the faith in the Buddha's teaching has to come first,

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.120
in the same sense, you will have faith in a doctor when he prescribes your medicine,

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.480
because if you don't have faith in the Buddha's teaching, if you were to start practicing,

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:04.600
but you're not free from suffering, but you understood it, you think, okay, I understood this,

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.680
but it's not free from suffering, I'll go to something else, but if you have faith in the Buddha's

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.440
teaching, then you question yourself, you're not going to place the blame on the teaching, you say,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.320
no, I have faith that this is right, yet I'm not free from suffering, means I haven't

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.720
fully understood it, so you make more effort and more, that's why it's a bit risky,

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:25.800
if you do pick up a wrong dhamma, a wrong teaching, a wrong instruction, even,

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:31.160
go to this Buddhism, you'll end up wasting, that's why the Buddha says it's like one of the worst

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:37.560
things, and certainly, in terms of the merit, it's presenting as dhamma, that which is not dhamma,

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:44.120
because see, you can obstruct many beings in finding the true dhamma, seeing on a kind of something

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:50.120
you just said, that kind of, you know, gain exposure and people heard it, and again, if you say

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.720
that faith in the Buddha's teaching, exactly, on a kind of faith of the Buddha, they thought

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.640
that what you were saying was right, they followed it for 50 years, and they haven't,

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:02.120
they're stupid to do that, and it's directly the result of what you basically misinterpreted.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:07.240
Obviously, that doesn't mean if you say something by accident, that somebody misunderstands,

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:13.320
means you deep down knowing your pathudjana, and you go out and teach, and tell people how to practice dhamma.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.920
It feels like no, but I'm doing it out of a good intention, yeah, good misguided intention,

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:26.760
and is that misguidedness? It's going to cost you a lot, because it will affect others, a lot more.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:36.680
And left alone, if somebody intentionally, like fully, misrepresents, because you do hear a lot,

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:44.040
a dhamma talk, where someone will talk and say, ends will start off by saying, I don't know,

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:52.200
anything, but let me tell you how it is. It absorbs them a bit, it absorbs a bit, because they say,

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.800
I don't know, I'm stupidudjana, but I'll give you an hour long dhamma talk, which is a

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.640
contradiction in tell me, it wouldn't be a dhamma talk then, because talking about dhamma, it's not

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.280
a dhamma, but it's a different topic. It absorbs them a bit, because then it's a responsibility

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:12.680
on those listeners to then hold on, he said he doesn't know, I mean, I might stay and listen,

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:18.600
but I will certainly not take any great heed in it. But if they ignore that, and then carry on,

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.280
it's a bit more than then, but many people never, you know, they don't say that often enough,

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:27.960
they don't say often enough, hey, I don't know, but I'll talk, I'll talk to you. But I think they

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.360
end up just getting used to talking and end up just talking. And then people end up thinking,

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:39.480
oh, they know what they're talking about. So that's where a person who does want to learn and

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:46.280
place faith needs to be very careful, where they place their faith in. And that's why you never

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.800
compromise your intelligence, reasoning, discernment, even on account of faith. Like you discern,

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:57.480
you use what you, any tools you have, any grains of wisdom you have, you get them all together,

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.320
and then choose wisely where you place your faith as something that's least likely going to be

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:09.080
wrong, because you don't know what's right, what's wrong. So what is least likely to be mistaken

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:16.200
down the road? And even that, you try carefully, step by step. Obviously, then, you know,

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:23.080
if you did place it rightly or least wrongly, you will start to discern more and more,

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.800
which means more and more grains of wisdom will be adding up, which means more and more of the

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.560
right criteria will be shaping up, which means faster and faster you can go.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:43.960
And this, this is a strange one. A, he passiga. A, he passiga. Inviting everyone to come and see

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:52.760
or open to all. Well, I think that's a bit of a liberal. It means come and see. Come and see.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.040
You're done man. Yeah. Oh, I want to really, I'm interested with your teaching stuff.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:04.200
Well, if you really, basically the teaching pretends only to be done. You can, as I said,

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.800
there is a difference between about the Dhamma and the Dhamma, and about the Dhamma is not the Dhamma,

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.360
and that's a very important distinction. So people who are about the Dhamma, you tell them,

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:19.800
no, come and see here. I do it. And that is what the Dhamma is not, but you, even if you're

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:26.280
peddling the very same phrases and words, you're not actually trying to see it for yourself.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.480
Thus, it's not the Dhamma, it's a bother Dhamma, and that's not the Dhamma. So come and see it,

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.240
and then you'll know it. That's the only way to know it is to come and see it.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.880
So, a, he passiga. Yeah.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:53.320
And then, some detail. Again, come and see for yourself. You start doing it. The more you do it,

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:59.400
the more you see, the more you see, the more you can do it. But if it's about the Dhamma,

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.200
it can often have a, have a little bit of it quite quickly. Oh, okay, that's what Dhamma is,

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.680
but you're not really making that personal effort internally to see it and understand it,

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:16.040
it feels like something, so that's it. It stops there. Dhamma is this, this and that, and I can

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.080
talk about it. I can talk from a different angle about it, but it's kind of frozen,

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:24.120
which is why it's not the Dhamma. The only Dhamma, the real Dhamma is the Dhamma,

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:31.400
it does the leads on. It's visible, they can be seen individually by the wise and those who make

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:39.080
effort. And it comes. Sorry. It comes about timeless. Yeah. It's simultaneously. It doesn't

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:44.600
pertain to your past, your future, basically. I mean, I don't know how it's always in the present,

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:49.640
because there's no choice about that. But basically timeless means it doesn't pertain to time,

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:57.640
literally. So, the principles of Dhamma are right there present, and your past is within those

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.960
principles, your future is within those principles, and your present is already within those principles

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:20.760
of the present Dhamma, the universals of your ingredients, the nature. Because it's the thing

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:28.120
that says, let be the past and the future. I will teach you the Dhamma with this, this is.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:40.760
Yeah, because as we spoke before, your past is present, your future is present. You can think

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:47.480
about your past and then give it time, and you're doing it in the present. You can think ahead,

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.680
plan your future, and you're thinking that right there and then in the present, or you can think

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:59.720
about present things in the present. So, you have past, present, future, and they're all within

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.760
the domain present, and there's no choice about that. So, when the Buddha talks about present,

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:09.640
he talks about that general domain of present, in which past, future, and present are present.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.720
He doesn't talk about that little present that's in between past and future, whereby

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:20.840
don't think about it, past, don't fantasize about the future, just being the present. You can help

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:26.680
him. Because it's not really past, future, present. It's either past, present,

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:34.840
a present future, sorry, past, present, or future, present. So, it's over-determined and under-determined

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:41.080
in regard to the determinant, which is present. The linear of past, future, present, it's a fantasy.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.800
We always, like, in regard to present, things they were overly determined, things they were gone,

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:53.080
things they were done, that's your past. Or if you look at the other, the opposite way,

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:59.480
in regard to this present, things that are yet to be, that's your future, but both are already within

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:07.000
the present. So, you can't stop thinking about the past or planning about the future,

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:14.360
what you can do is basically not forget or not you know that you're doing it presently.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.760
But you want to see the principle? Well, that is already the principle.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:24.920
Yeah. That's already the principle. And especially when it comes down to

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:32.360
Dharma, as a teaching, if you talk about the principle of Patitian Father, which is the time

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.000
in this principle, principle of Akali ka, that's simultaneous present. With this, this is.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:43.720
So, with appearance, existence is, or we spoke before, or with craving, suffering is.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:50.840
Simultaneously present to the same extent. So, no, and that is very important to bring down and

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.080
start discerning it to get a simultaneously to the same extent. Why? Because you say,

01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:00.680
suffering is because of craving. People immediately assume, natural assume,

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:07.560
it's the craving that arises and then, and use in time for a while, if they are craving,

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.320
I crave, I'm doing this. And then the suffering follows. No.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:17.720
The suffering is in the very presence of craving. That's what suffering is.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.480
So, you could say it's the same thing, but it's not because it can be discerned.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:28.440
But it's certainly simultaneously present things.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:39.000
So, you can't possibly disjoin them and just say craving and look at the craving

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.680
without suffering being present at the time. Nor can you be thinking about suffering

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:51.400
and discerning suffering without craving being present at the time. So, it's timeless.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:57.400
And no matter how much time externally might be passing, notion of time might be passing.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:05.240
This principle of simultaneous present is the present. It's that general present which has

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.920
past is already determined, and future is under-determined in regard to the journey.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.720
I've heard a few things.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:24.200
Maybe it's craving and then something will rise in the future. There's maybe a possibility that

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.160
it might not arise in the future. Exactly. So, I mean else might not. Which means,

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:33.400
exactly. So, therefore craving is not. Therefore, craving is not the time is the determination of

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:38.120
the suffering which you have picked up by the sense it is. With craving, suffering is.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:44.520
You might want to learn how to crave. Well, exactly. And not suffering.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.920
But you recognize, okay, so it's the presence of craving

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:53.240
results in the presence of suffering right there and then to the same extent. So, if the craving

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:58.920
ceases, suffering cannot remain even for a nanosecond afterwards without suffering. So,

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:03.800
it's simultaneously arising and simultaneously ceasing. And that is the recognition of a

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:13.240
titan part. Now, obviously, if you have the ultimate, the greatest wisdom of the Sama-Sanghuda,

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:20.280
then that one principle of simultaneous arising, simultaneous ceasing, you can sort of describe

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:27.080
and divide many, many, many different. Well, 12 or more in digonika, when you just start

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:31.240
describing a titan part, it's slightly different terms later on and so on. So, you can go

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:35.080
in all this intricately, but it's still the same principle. That's why every titan part starts

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:41.480
with this, this is. And then we what? And then it goes on. It within that principle. And that's what,

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:46.520
and that, and yeah, he did say, one who's in a cycle that says, one who sees dama, sees

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:50.040
become part of the one, sees, but it's some part of sees the dama. Because that's what the dama is.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:25:02.120
It's that principle. Principle of simultaneous presence. And you can, again, you don't have to go

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:07.960
into all of the intricate, very, very subtle descriptions of the Buddha and the titan part.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.920
You can just take the very coarse division of mind and body. Because those are general phenomena,

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:23.960
regular as such. And if you start seeing your body as well inconceivable without the presence of

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:30.920
the mind, and vice versa, the mind would be inconceivable. Like, you might as, like, and that's it,

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:36.360
by not thinking about it, by not discerning it as inconceivable, you end up conceiving it through

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:44.120
your assumption that it might stay on. It might. My mind might stay on in the body breaks apart.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.840
You conceive, many people conceive that through the assumption of it might. And that's it.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:58.040
What you just said before, you don't necessarily know, but just the fact that you don't see it

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.520
simultaneously, you allow the possibility for it to enter. And that possibility is more than enough

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:09.240
for the assumption of, yes, it will. But if you were to think long enough, and it is,

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.600
whenever you think about your mind, there is an image of the body, at least in the background,

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:17.320
or at least right here right now. If this body, physical body, is not operating,

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:22.760
if this heart is not pumping, if this brain is not working, you wouldn't be able to think.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:29.080
Why? Because any experience of thinking that you know of, that you can think of, that you can

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:37.240
imagine, even in the future, implies the notion of your body, thus it's inseparable from it.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:41.720
It's some kind. And same again, if you were to start thinking about the body,

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:47.960
you're like, well, I'm thinking about it, thus, mentally, accessing it, so to speak. So that's

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:54.520
the only way you can. There is a pure sense, sense in itself, it's not aware of itself,

01:26:54.520 --> 01:27:07.880
thus it's not. But with the mind, they are discerned, they meet in it, they appear in it.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:45.560
So, to be able to see the extent of possibility, judging by that, things can only go so far,

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:56.040
like it can only go so far. Well, I'm not sure. But the mind is not, not everything is possible,

01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.400
it can't survive by itself. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, that's what you mean, yeah, sure, yeah.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:07.240
I don't understand, I don't mean by the extent of all the possible, no, basically what you're saying,

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:13.240
seeing the nature of possibilities. Again, you have to have a reason thing in order for possibilities

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:17.400
to be possible in regard to what has a reason, thus possibilities in itself cannot resist.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.040
They cannot remain standing if there is not that which is possible, what they are possible in regard to.

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:33.720
That's what it is. So that's the thing, like, you can assume the possibility that you don't know

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:38.280
your mind, my carry on, your consciousness, my carry on itself. But if you stop to think about it,

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:43.160
intelligently, authentically recognize that any notion, any designation of your mind, of your

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.960
consciousness is known in this experience as such. And even if you think about the future after

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:54.200
your death, so to speak, you are assuming some sort of material body. You are. There is, like, not,

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.960
not, not, not like voluntarily, but it's implied in the notion of mind continuing, why? Because

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:05.640
you only know mind as inseparable from, because it is inseparable from. So then the question is

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:14.040
basically just, sorry, the task is then to discern the notions of physical body that you carry

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.560
in the assumptions of your mind in the future. And then the assumptions of the mind as free from

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:30.920
body and everything else will just cease. And it's inconceivable, even in theory, to just think about

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:38.920
the mind without the body. Even that actually affected by that principle of being inseparable from.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.320
And if you look at it closely, you'll see, like, if you think my mind in the future,

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:48.360
but you are there assuming most likely, most often, as your body is basically your own face,

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:53.800
face of your own physical image, that you associate with that notion of mind, that it's now

01:29:53.800 --> 01:30:00.120
implied in that my mind. My mind, but at the very end of that image of my mind, there is a

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:08.040
picture of Tanya sending. If you push it far enough, you'll see, oh, you apply, you imply

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:14.280
your current form in that notion of my mind, because my mind is inseparable from the form,

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:21.000
even in theory. For a sense of mind, a sense of mind. Yeah, well that's the thing, that sense of

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.880
mind or sense of form stands for that which form is. You don't actually have to have the physical,

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:29.880
because even the physical physical is only a form of a sense of this kind of present.

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.080
Currently present.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.680
Because I said, if you try and think about your body right here, right now, look at it.

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:50.760
You know it, an aspect of it, because they appear mentally. These images appear mentally.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:58.120
That's form, root, and itself. It's inconceivable, but you perceive it through the assumption.

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.960
You could see nature, seeing houses. How do you simulate it here, isn't it?

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:12.120
Simultaneous, the reason. So again, as I said, you don't have to, you don't have to go into

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:17.240
intricate details of the physical father, just discover the principle where this, this is,

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:26.040
and then drill everything through that, that's your gateway, that principle.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:34.200
Presence of the mind, present, like two separate domains that exist. You don't have to say,

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:47.640
the core exists directly, the AAPS simultaneously, and they are, like, impossible to discern one part from the other.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:53.960
So even when you're just thinking abstractly about one, I don't want to apply in that thought.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:57.560
You're better.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:02.920
Well, you can come down even slightly closer, and you can even say, well,

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:07.480
which would be able to think about the future and your mind carrying on, if this body is not

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:12.120
living right here right now, which would be able to have those thoughts that pertain to the future,

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:15.400
if this body is not breathing right there while you're thinking it, you wouldn't.

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:22.440
So no matter how separate, how different it feels, it arranges together, and that's why it's hard to see it.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:27.880
Because it only pertains to the simple nature of simultaneous presence, nothing else in common.

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:35.080
Thus, it's so easy to assume that they are not in this body. They might, they're two different entities,

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:39.240
they're two separate entities, they're like, you know, they might sort of, one is like the other one's

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:46.040
right, they might do things together or whatever else. But it's hard to just see to discern

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:50.040
that the only thing they really have in common is that they're simultaneously present,

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:54.440
and you can't see one without the other, and then you build one that.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:07.000
Because no matter how pleasing your fantasy about, well, my mind, my consciousness will continue

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.840
because it makes sense, because of this, because of that, you're thinking those very things right there,

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:14.120
right now in that very present moment while your body is breathing. Their body,

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:19.000
their heart stops at the time, right there, and then, would you be able to continue those thoughts?

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:25.960
When the only thoughts you know so far, and the thoughts that you're trying to send into

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:31.320
future as valid facts are known because of the breathing body right here right now.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:38.040
So you actually have no concept of what experience of mind without a living body would be.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:43.320
And even when you think about the possibility of it, it already implies that both

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.680
you're living because you're thinking about the possibility of it while you're living.

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.960
So you can't step outside of it. And fortunately, you don't need it.

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:58.920
All you have to do is stop assuming it. See one depending on the other and you, your sense of self,

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:05.160
completely redundant. And because it's redundant, it will fade by itself through the cultivation of

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:10.040
this simultaneous, through this principle of simultaneity, but it's a pattern. So you don't have to

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:15.160
see your mind as inseparable from the body and the body as indistinguishable without a mind.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.160
You don't have to see that first and then free yourself from the, you know, self view and I am, no.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.680
Freedom from those things will be the result of seeing that principle.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.240
Because the body is there, given the reason and the mind in regard to it.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:34.600
There's no room for yourself.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.160
And by knowing that there can't be any sense of self in regard to those things because they

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:47.400
did a different to it. It's just mind and body. Two sticks holding each other.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:54.440
You remove one, the other one goes with it. But not knowing that you can't, all those things

01:34:54.440 --> 01:35:01.320
could come control, can't, can't be in them. You place yourself in there, you assume, you assume

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:07.000
you are. But fully discerning that you can't be there, you stop assuming that you are there,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.280
because now you know that you can't be there.

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.000
So this mind right here, right there and this body right here, right there, whatever,

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:23.000
for you, yours, for me, mind. It's present. And then you can have all the, you know,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:29.560
on a more particular level, all the experiences of this sense, of that sense, this emotion,

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:33.480
of that emotion, this aggregate, of that aggregate, depending on the approach you have. But basically,

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:39.800
you do need body living body and consciousness in regard to it.

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.440
So those two things and they are inaccessible to you.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:51.880
You cannot prove to your consciousness or you cannot prove to the consciousness.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:58.440
No, can you take hold of that, of that physical, as a physical material form.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.960
They simultaneously arise, they simultaneously cease.

01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.240
So what you can do is remove desire and lust in regard to them and then it won't be any problems.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:21.640
These are the lust that manifests through basically lust or aversion or delusion.

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:28.680
In regard to that inaccessible, in regard to the principle of those inaccessible things,

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:37.640
matter and consciousness. And when I say inaccessible, I mean, I work like that,

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:44.520
I mean, you can't take hold of it, you can't even think consciousness. And you must certainly

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:50.280
kind of think pure form because, well, you already can see a continuation thinking pure form.

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.640
That's a thought, that's not pure form. And even the idea of something being a pure form

01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:00.200
can only be known as a thought of that which pure form might be, thus it's a thought in its nature.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:05.320
So how can I know pure form? You can't. We can just remove its footing,

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:09.720
it's appropriation. So you can't touch it and you're done. That's all you need to do.

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.960
The point is that to see it over and over and over.

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:26.360
Array for the tissue. Drilling. Drilling. Training. That's why the Buddha said he trains himself

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:32.200
lust, he trains it. Just training, repeating, therefore training gives repetition. Just repeating,

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.120
training, and training, and increasing, and training, and so on.
