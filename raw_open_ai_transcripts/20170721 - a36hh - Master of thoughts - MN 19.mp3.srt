1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,400
So the sutras I'll read out now are concerned with thinking and thoughts.

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:23,120
The first sutra is in the Majuminikaya, I'm a 19 and it's called Two Kinds of Thought.

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:30,920
Thus have I heard on one occasion the blessed one was living in Sarvati, there he addressed

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:40,760
because thus, the blessed one said this, because before my Enlightenment while I was still

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,560
only an unenlightened Bodhisattva, it occurred to me, suppose that I divide my thoughts into

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:55,360
two classes, then I sat on one side, thoughts of central desire, thoughts of ill-world, thoughts

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,480
of cruelty, and sat on the other side, thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of non-ill-world,

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,480
and thoughts of non-cruelty.

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:12,280
As I abided thus, the diligent ardent and resolute, I thought of central desire erosing me.

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,440
I understood thus, this thought of central desire has arisen in me.

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,200
This leads to my own affliction to the others affliction and to the affliction of both.

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,080
It abstracts Wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from nibbani.

13
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,560
When I considered this leads to my own affliction, it is subsided in me.

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,720
When I considered this leads to others affliction, it subsided in me.

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,760
When I considered this leads to the affliction of both, it is subsided in me.

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,960
When I considered this obstructs wisdom causes difficulties and leads away from nibbana,

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
it subsided in me.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,980
Whenever a thought of sensual desire arose in me, I abandoned it, removed it, and did

19
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,680
away with it.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,440
As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, I thought of ill will arose in me, I thought

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,440
of cruelty arose in me.

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,000
I understood thus, this thought of cruelty has arisen in me, this leads to my own affliction

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,160
to others affliction and to the affliction of both, if struts wisdom causes difficulties

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,920
and leads away from nibbana.

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,320
When I considered thus, it subsided in me, and whenever a thought of cruelty or ill will

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,360
arose in me, I abandoned it, removed it, and did away with it.

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,600
So this is from the point of view that he was a bodhisattva, so someone who was inclined

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,480
to go to my experience.

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,000
But he also, so he clearly knew what nibbana was, because he said it leads away from nibbana,

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,800
so he already had the understanding of what nibbana is, and then he decided what if I divide

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,080
my thoughts in these two categories, because basically you can also say these two categories

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
is the thoughts that lead away from nibbana, and the thoughts that don't lead away from

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
nibbana.

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Thoughts that lead away from nibbana are thoughts of sensuality, ill will, and cruelty, thoughts

35
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,640
that don't lead away from nibbana are thoughts of non-sensuality, non-yield will and non-cruelty

36
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,760
of renunciation.

37
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,200
So nibbana is something to be understood, which is by understanding, brings you closer

38
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,640
to it, and then developing your mind in regard to that understanding, basically makes you

39
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,520
sort of abide in nibbana, like an arahanya.

40
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm saying this, because most commonly nibbana is understood as some sort of transcendental

41
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,120
art of this world state, that you kind of stumble upon if you have luck, if you've been

42
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,720
trying hard enough, then it happens to you.

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,360
No, it's basic, it's a practice of understanding, understanding what nibbana is, understanding

44
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,280
what dispassion is, seeing it as valuable, as the most important thing, seeing it as peaceful,

45
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:25,520
seeing it as worthy, and then developing it, developing nibbana, yeah.

46
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,200
And another thing to point out there, it's essential thoughts are rosy in me, so essential

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,320
thought would have a reason, in Bodhisattva, or in Sobri, who takes it, and you recognize

48
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,640
it, either rises on its own, and that's not on him.

49
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,640
What is on him is wrongly attending to it, attending it as valuable, attending it as dear,

50
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,320
delighting in it, wanting it, proliferating it, but turning your mind away from it, then

51
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,360
the thing will disappear.

52
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,360
So he would see, oh this is harmful to me.

53
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,640
This is not pleasant or agreeable.

54
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,280
It leads to my harm, it leads to harm of others, it leads to harm of both, and ultimately

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,640
it leads away from nibbana, which is the ultimate goal.

56
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,720
So there would be enough, and then that thought would go away, because the mind would genuinely

57
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,200
not want it, which means then either has a reason, or it's on a court, and then it has

58
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,960
seized why, because it hasn't been, you know, somebody turns up in front of you, and he's

59
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,400
unwelcome, and he leaves, because he realizes he's unwelcome.

60
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:45,040
You're soon to continue, because whatever big of frequently things and pundits is upon,

61
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,080
that will become the inclination of his mind.

62
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,360
If he frequently thinks and pundits upon thoughts of central desire, he has abandoned the thought

63
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,040
of renunciation, to cultivate the thought of central desire, and then his mind inclines

64
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,080
to what the thought of central desire.

65
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,160
If he frequently thinks and pundits upon thoughts of ill will, upon thoughts of cruelty, he

66
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,400
has abandoned the thought of non-ill will, or non-cruity, to cultivate the thought of cruelty

67
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,080
or will will, and then his mind inclines to what the thought of cruelty.

68
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:25,600
And he gives a bit of a little simile, just as in the last month of the rainy season in

69
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,840
the autumn, when the crops thicken, a car herd would guard his cows by constantly tapping

70
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,240
and poking them on the side, and that with a stick to check and curve them.

71
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,560
Why is that?

72
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,280
Because he sees that he could be flubbed, imprisoned, find, or blamed, if he let them

73
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,720
stray into the crops.

74
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,960
So too, I saw in unwholesome states danger, degradation, and affarmment, and in wholesome

75
00:06:51,960 --> 00:07:00,840
states, a blessing of renunciation, the aspect of cleansing.

76
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,720
As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of renunciation arose in me.

77
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,320
I understood thus.

78
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,320
This thought of renunciation has arisen in me.

79
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,880
This does not lead to my own affliction, or to the others affliction, or to the affliction

80
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
of both.

81
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,000
It aids wisdom and does not cause difficulties and leads to nebony.

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,880
If I think and ponder upon the thoughts, even for a night, even for a day, even for a

83
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,560
night and day, I see nothing to fear from it.

84
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,880
But with excess of thinking and pundering, I might tire my body, and when my body is tired,

85
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,200
the mind becomes strange, and when the mind is strange, it is far from composure.

86
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:55,080
So I steadied my mind internally, quieted it, wrought it to singleness, and composed it.

87
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Why is that?

88
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:05,360
So that my mind should not be restrained, and likewise with the thoughts of non-airworld,

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,680
and thought of unhappiness.

90
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,760
And again, because whatever a vehicle frequently thinks and punders upon, that will become the

91
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,280
inclination of this mind.

92
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,360
If you frequently think and punders upon thoughts of renunciation, he has abandoned thoughts

93
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,880
of sensual desire, to cultivate the thoughts of renunciation, and then his mind inclines

94
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,760
the thoughts of renunciation.

95
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:36,320
And the next simile, just as in the last month of the hot season, when all the crops have

96
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,600
been brought inside the villages, a cow herd would guard his cows while staying at the

97
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:49,240
root of a tree or at or out in the open, since he needs only to be mindful that the cows

98
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
are there.

99
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,720
So too, there was no need for me, there was need for me only to be mindful that those states

100
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
were there.

101
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,360
Tires, tireless energy was aroused in me, and unremitting mindfulness was established.

102
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,920
But you didn't have to chase an individual.

103
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,920
My body was tranquil and untraveled, my mind composed and unified.

104
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:22,280
And then he goes into the janas, goes through the janas and all the different knowledges

105
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,760
that he had, you know, he had tamed all the ignorance was banished and true knowledge

106
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
arose.

107
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,040
So which is weakening there as well, though, but just to address what he said before.

108
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,280
So first a person needs to know what mebana is, which basically means a person needs to

109
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,640
develop samadhi, needs to get the right view.

110
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,760
Once the right view is there, all the person has to do is divide his stalks into wholesome

111
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,160
and unwholesome, into those that lead away from mebana and those that lead towards mebana.

112
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,400
Actually, Mark Pajapati came to the wood and said, oh, can you give me a short instruction

113
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,240
and I will go on a retreat, leaping the forest.

114
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
And he said, whatever you know, it's wholesome, whatever you know, it's unwholesome abandon

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,440
it, whatever you know, it's wholesome cultivated in terms of the thinking.

116
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,000
And it's exactly the same.

117
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,840
So with the right view, all you need to do is divide the thoughts into categories and

118
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,440
stick to it.

119
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920
So sometimes it's going to be hard work as much as it is to guard your head from like,

120
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,280
don't go too much left, don't go too much right, don't go into this crop, don't go into

121
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,960
that crop because you'll end up in serious trouble.

122
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,680
But once that's done, then all you need to know, her is there, all you sit under the tree

123
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,600
on top of a hill and see it is there, no problem, they're not going anywhere because there's

124
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,240
nothing pulling them now, all the crops are gone.

125
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,840
So they're just just kind of at ease sitting on a field and you can see it and that means

126
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,920
oh, you're not, you have so much energy now, such a piece, no worry, no distraction,

127
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,560
not tired, and you're established upon that and that is the pleasure of John.

128
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,880
Because, what is your thoughts of renunciation, you don't be cultivating it.

129
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Exactly.

130
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Thoughts of renunciation.

131
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Yeah.

132
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,880
The cultivation basically comes down to saying no to sensuality, saying no to your will,

133
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
saying no to cruelty.

134
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,600
When you get established upon that, it's just there and that is effortless.

135
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,360
And knowing that, then this whole joy and the unremitting mindfulness and pious energy

136
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,720
arises and that's the first genre of the thoughts are there.

137
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,160
The thoughts that are not thoughts of sensuality, not thoughts of your will, not thoughts of

138
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
cruelty.

139
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,720
And by having just these thoughts there, you know, ah, those unhoresome thoughts cannot

140
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
enter.

141
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
They're gone.

142
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,320
They're disposed.

143
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,840
Because these people were trying to cultivate thoughts of kindness, certainly.

144
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,160
Well, yeah, actually, just kind of gave me another point to say, ah, people will try

145
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,080
to cultivate practice of genre in very common sense, so to then not have sensuality and

146
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
not have this.

147
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,240
But that needs to be abandoned beforehand, through wisdom and clear seeing, and then

148
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
you enter the genre.

149
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,240
So when these, like, quite secluded from unhoresome states, as every description of genre says,

150
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,240
then the mind gets settled in that and established, and then he enters and abides in that genre.

151
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,720
As I was saying earlier today, then he can, once his mind is abiding in genre, and that's

152
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,040
some of the sort that he walks around, he urines, he defecates, he extends his arm, he

153
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,920
does it, and his mind is in that genre.

154
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,080
That's secluded from unhoresome states.

155
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:57,640
Like dear, in a mosquito-free marsh, or like months in a mosquito-free marsh, right here.

156
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,520
So the point is then, once such level of uninterrupted clarity is established, with the right view,

157
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,160
which means with knowledge of when the mind is, then the mind gets developed knowledge, further

158
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,280
and further and further, as that suitable dog.

159
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,840
And that's, enters and abides in the banner, and he's finished.

160
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:30,080
No more arsevers to come back, and it's done.

161
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,840
In the banner, it's not hard to understand.

162
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,400
It's subtle, because people's minds are too far away from it, because they revolve

163
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,520
around sensuality, ill will, and cruelty.

164
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,880
But the banner literally means absence of greed, aversion delusion, means absence of passion,

165
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,320
cooling down all the passions you can imagine, subtle of course.

166
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,920
See, the protugina can get his head around that.

167
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,120
And if he was to stick to it, stick to avoiding unhoresome, stick to virtue, stick to sealer,

168
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,240
stick to all of those other things, they would be conducive towards his idea of this

169
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,480
passion, then he would actually clarify that idea more and more, and with further reading

170
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,800
of the silters and input from the Buddha, or if he has a living art, a hunter, a living

171
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,160
sort of fun, even better, but even without it, he would actually come close and then, yeah,

172
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,240
that's what the banner is, and get the right view.

173
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,920
But it would require, obviously, quite a great deal of mind development, of sticking to

174
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:42,040
the, you know, not letting your mental thoughts, your heard wander into the crops.

175
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,400
Doesn't mean saying no to everything, you don't have to say no to things, that it doesn't

176
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,040
involve sensuality, it doesn't involve cruelty, it doesn't involve ill will.

177
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,760
But you certainly need to be very mindful of it, because it might involve sensuality, it

178
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,040
might involve, it might involve ill will, always being efficient in myself, to others, does

179
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
it work?

180
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,680
No, it doesn't bring a fiction to me, no to others, no to both, okay then, but even then

181
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,440
you don't eat negligently, you don't give into it in negligence.

182
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:21,320
So with my sensual design, always, sexual integral, you say, will this bring a fiction to

183
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
myself?

184
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,120
Yeah, like the other sort, that is to be completely abandoned, there is no ground whereby

185
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,600
sexual intercourse, or sensuality of that kind would, oh, can be done mindful of something

186
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,600
that you can't, so you can eat mindfully, you can sort of come across sight, sound, smell,

187
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,600
taste, touches mindfully, but sexual intercourse cannot be done mindful, so that needs to be

188
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
abandoned.

189
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:59,720
Causing a fiction to others, using another person, and entanglement, difficulty.

190
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,440
And fundamentally, as I said before, as a synthesizer before, the one we read, you can't

191
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,240
have sensuality without being bound by sensual perceptions, sorry, you can't engage in a

192
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,800
sexual intercourse without being bound by sensual perceptions, so you can't, you can't say

193
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,280
I'm free from sensuality and then practice sexual integral, impossible, because there's

194
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,880
no sexual intercourse without your mind being bound by sensual perceptions, and if the mind

195
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,880
is bound by sensual perceptions, well, that is as far from the bond as it can be.

196
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:50,880
And the suit will end with my favorite things, what it says, there are these roots of trees,

197
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,880
empty hearts, meditate because you're not delay, or else you will regret it later.

198
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:05,440
So, because you have in the right view, you know what Mibane is, now go to these empty

199
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:14,160
dwellings, roots of trees, forest, mountains, and practice, develop further clarity.

200
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Don't be negligent.

201
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:25,360
So, that suits the ends, and that is what the best one said, because we're satisfied

202
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:54,360
and delighted in the best ones here.

203
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:01,360
So, there's another suit on this, on this same subject of thought, that's the next one,

204
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:10,040
my dhima, my dhima nikah, twenty, the removal of distracting thoughts.

205
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,420
Thus, have I heard, on one occasion, that this one was living in Salvation, there he

206
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:23,500
He addressed the Bikku's us, Bikku's, Renable Serlope playing, the best one said this.

207
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,480
Bikku's, when a Bikku is pursuing the higher mind from time to time, he should give

208
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,460
attention to five signs, what are the five?

209
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:41,900
Here, Bikku's, when a Bikku is giving attention to some sign and owing to that sign,

210
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,180
they arise in him evil unhulsing thoughts connected with Paziah, connected with hate, with

211
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:55,020
delusion, then he should give attention to some other sign connected with what is wholesome.

212
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,500
When he gives attention to some other sign connected with what is wholesome, then any

213
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,300
evil unhulsing thoughts connected with Paziah, with hate and with delusion are abandoned

214
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,820
in him and subside.

215
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,460
With the abandoning of him, his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to

216
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,300
singleness and compose.

217
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,820
Just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice might knock out, remove or extract a coarse

218
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:30,380
peg by means of a fine one, so too, when a Bikku gives attention to some other sign connected

219
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:36,460
with what is wholesome, his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness

220
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,020
and compose.

221
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,300
If while he is giving attention to some other sign, you are so dressed so you don't

222
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
be.

223
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,900
Well, obviously, the main thing that emerges from this is understanding the nature of the

224
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
sign.

225
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,940
So, the mind arises on its own, it's a phenomenon, it's manifested.

226
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,500
You attend to its aspects and based on the aspect you are attending, based on the signs,

227
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,020
signs and tokens, as often it says in the cities.

228
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:16,420
So, this is like a general notion in regard to the reason mind, to the reason thought.

229
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,500
By attending to them, then you might be contributing towards more of the unhulsing thoughts or towards

230
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,500
going back to the wholesome thoughts, depending on what you choose to attend to.

231
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:33,140
So, the point is to recognize it as a slightly indirect nature, in a sense that you are not

232
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,060
trying to deny what has a reason in your mind, or you are trying to deny what mood your

233
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,220
mind is in, what a general state mind is in.

234
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,340
You are not denying that, you are just recognizing that by attending to something else, it will

235
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,460
drift away from that if there was unhulsing, if there was wholesome, then it's fine.

236
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,980
You keep your watch on it, so to speak, so if it's wholesome, it doesn't mean you become

237
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,580
negugent, as I said just a minute ago.

238
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,260
You keep watching, but it's an out effortless because you don't need to take it away from

239
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
it.

240
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:11,260
So, it's like a, again, a similar of a cow herd that you have to keep an eye.

241
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,860
If the cows see the green crops, well they will be very inclined towards it, then you have

242
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,820
to hold them back, and that's hard work, and it's tiresome.

243
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,340
So you then foresee the sign of the green crops, they will disturb, they will excite the

244
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,140
cows, so then you direct them somewhere else in a different direction where they won't

245
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,420
see the green crops, and then they'll become, because there's nothing exciting about it,

246
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,620
and then you'll be at ease, because you don't have to work hard to keep it away from

247
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,620
the crops.

248
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,620
This is simple and technical.

249
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
Exactly.

250
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,260
So, you recognize by being in such environment, or by thinking in certain things, well the

251
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,580
mind will get excited.

252
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,780
So you don't do that, you look at the opposite, you focus on the opposite, so then the

253
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,100
mind comes down.

254
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,940
But it's important to have that sign of that mind, to recognize it for what it is.

255
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,380
It's an independent enemy.

256
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:13,500
It's not you, because they would imply that direction, sorry, direct kind of controllable,

257
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,700
which you don't have.

258
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:22,300
As a reason is, so you have indirect responsibility by bringing your cowhurt foolishly in front

259
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,020
of a green crop, what you expect going to happen.

260
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,620
So you foresee that, and you don't put them there, you put them somewhere else, maybe

261
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,980
behind the corner where they can't see it.

262
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,820
Then they might smell it, every now and then, if the wind blows in the direction.

263
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,180
So then you refine the signs and tokens you pick on, okay, they don't see it, but if

264
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,500
the wind blows the smell it, so then in a different way, when you block the smell, you

265
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,740
light the fire, so the smoke kind of obscures the smell of various things.

266
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,140
Point being, you recognize the mind as an independent animal, that needs kind of catering

267
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,740
and watchful eye.

268
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:05,380
And that's how you take it away from sensuality and bring it closer to new bond.

269
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,380
Well, so it continues, if wow, they're giving attention to some other sign connected with

270
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,100
what is wholesome, they're still arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connected to

271
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:24,460
desire, with hate and with delusion, then he should examine the danger in those thoughts.

272
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,540
These thoughts are unwholesome, they are reprehensible, they result in suffering.

273
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,140
When he examines the danger in those thoughts, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected

274
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,860
with desire, with hate and with delusion are abandoned, in him and subside.

275
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,740
With abandoning of them, his mind becomes steady, internally, quieted, brought to singleness

276
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:53,780
and concentrated, just as a man or woman, young, youthful and fond of ornaments, would

277
00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:00,020
be horrified, humiliated and disgusted with the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human

278
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:06,100
being, who hunt around his or her neck, so too when a big examines the danger in those

279
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:14,020
thoughts, his mind becomes steady, internally, quieted, brought to singleness and composed.

280
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:20,940
So when simply directing away, or whatever was unwholesome, is not enough, then you have

281
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:27,820
to make more of an effort, whereby you start dwelling on the dangers of letting cow

282
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:37,020
go into the crop, imprisonment, trouble, difficulty, fine, basically the dangerous sensuality.

283
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:45,500
So then the like gives you more motivation to take it away from that which excites it,

284
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:55,700
this will take your mind away to bring it to this passion, to not give in to passion.

285
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,020
But while he is examining the danger in those thoughts, they are still arising in evil

286
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,980
and wholesome thoughts connected with desire, with hate and with illusion, then he should

287
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,460
try to forget those thoughts which should not give attention to them, when he tries to

288
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:15,300
forget those thoughts and does not give attention to them, then any evil unwholesome thoughts

289
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:21,260
connected with desire, with hate and with illusion are abandoning him and subsides, with

290
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:27,700
abandoning him, his mind becomes steady, internally, quieted, brought to singleness and composed.

291
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,580
Just as a man with good eyes, who did not want to see forms that had come within range

292
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:38,260
of sight, would either shut his eyes or look away, so too, when a big could try to forget

293
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,260
those thoughts and does not give attention to them, his mind becomes steady, internally,

294
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,700
quieted, brought to singleness and composed.

295
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:54,740
Go back into the, using the car soonly, car heard, so you have taken the car away from

296
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:04,300
seeing the crop, there is no smell of the fresh grass, fresh crop, disturbing them anymore,

297
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,020
they are tied down to the ground, you keep an eye on them, but basically they are still

298
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,060
excited, because they still have the memory of the crop, but then you just sit down and

299
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,380
ignore them, because you know, well they can't get there, could you turn them away, they

300
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,780
are secured, wherever they are away from the crop, just ignore them, because they will

301
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,980
calm down, and then they calm down, you don't fuss around, because it disturbs you,

302
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,300
you recognize, okay, you needed to fuss around until there was still a danger of them

303
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,860
going into the crop, but now you've done, you removed that possibility, now just ignore

304
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,860
it and they'll calm down.

305
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:49,900
Like for seeing, they go into the forest, there won't be any central disturbances, you

306
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:57,460
go to the forest, you take your mind into the forest by basically walking your body there,

307
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,940
and then you leave your mind, your body there, which means your mind is bound with it, so

308
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,660
your mind has to be in that forest, in that environment, and then it will calm down,

309
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:14,820
there might be memory of the perceptions of excitement of whatever else, but sooner or

310
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:24,340
later it will calm down, it gets there, it gets there, it gets there.

311
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,380
If while he is trying to forget those thoughts and is not giving attention to them, there

312
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,780
is still a rise in him, evil and wholesome thoughts, connected with desire, with hate and

313
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:39,260
with delusion, then he should give attention to the stilling of the thought, determination

314
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,980
of those thoughts.

315
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,820
When he gives attention to the stilling of the thought, determination of those thoughts,

316
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,020
then any evil and wholesome thoughts, connected with desire, with hate and with delusion,

317
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,980
are abandoned in him and subside.

318
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,900
With abandoning of them, his mind becomes steadyed internally, quieted, brought to singleness

319
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,020
and concentrate, composed.

320
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:07,120
This is a man walking trust might consider, why am I walking fast?

321
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,880
What if I walk slowly?

322
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,660
and he, he would walk slowly, then he might consider, why am I walking slowly, what if I stands?

323
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,920
and he would stand?

324
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,680
then he might consider, why am I standing, what if I sit?

325
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,220
and he would sit?

326
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,360
then he might consider, why am I sitting?

327
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,840
what if I lay down?

328
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,060
and he would lay down?

329
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:35,660
By doing so, he would substitute for each gross posture one that was subtly.

330
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:42,940
So that point, or that step, so to speak, basically that's the step that goes beyond

331
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,140
wholesome and unwholesome.

332
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Why?

333
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:52,060
Because addressing unwholesome and addressing dangers with wholesome didn't work.

334
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,500
The threat is still there.

335
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:04,980
So that step pertains to the nature of thoughts, stealing that which determines the thinking,

336
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,620
that which every thought has in common, be wholesome or unwholesome.

337
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:18,180
And what every thought has in common is movement as a phenomenon.

338
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,460
On the level of images, of mind, there is a movement.

339
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,980
So you recognize, okay, they want to move in this direction, I take them, I move them

340
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:31,180
into this direction, then they want to move, they still want to move in the other direction,

341
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,420
then I ignore the movement, then I do this.

342
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:39,020
But when none of that works, then you start refining the nature of the movement.

343
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:46,940
As a result of that, the course movement, sorry, the core sensuality that's being carried

344
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,220
with a course, a form of movement, is being saved out.

345
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,260
So if you're walking fast, which is what sensuality is basically excitement, you slow down

346
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,780
and then there is no room to that refined movement for a course movement of sensuality

347
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,900
to come through.

348
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:14,300
Then you refine it further and further and further until it's still and it doesn't move.

349
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,060
Because there is no sensuality, there is no disturbance, there is no excitement without

350
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,900
mental movement.

351
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,100
It can be a mental movement without that particular excitement.

352
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,100
And that's why you use mental movement, refining of the mental movement, so to abandon

353
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,220
that particular unwholesome excitement.

354
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:40,100
Then the mind comes out of that singleness, that stillness, but the excitement is gone.

355
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:48,220
And then you can go back to the normal, whatever daily movement of a wholesome thought.

356
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,140
To do this, you obviously have to be able to see your mind still, yeah, obviously.

357
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,020
Even to do the first step, you need to have the sign of your mind, which means you need

358
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,820
to have the right view again.

359
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:06,620
Because that section sounds like I've heard others explain it, that one should think

360
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,620
slowly.

361
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:17,540
You know, like, I am going to get that, so in a way, you are kind of slowing down your

362
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
thoughts.

363
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Well, you are refining your thoughts.

364
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,180
You are slowing down the movement of your thoughts, but you are not slowing down your

365
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,420
discernment or your clarity.

366
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:32,380
You are slowing down the intentions, what is it?

367
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,540
No, not necessarily.

368
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,940
Your intention is to get rid of the unwholesome.

369
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,940
It's still very much present, you are refining, you are basically seeing unwholesome, there

370
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:52,980
is the unwholesome thought, there is a thought, there is a movement within that thought, that

371
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,980
is dictated by that unwholesome basically.

372
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,660
So you can say like this, there is an unwholesome moving thought, refined that, there is a moving

373
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:14,740
thought, refined that, there is a thought, still thought, it doesn't move.

374
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:21,340
So you start seeing within the movement of the unwholesome thought, and then within that,

375
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,480
and then within that, and then within that, and that is stillness, and that is quite

376
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,860
requires clarity and a clear notion of the sign of the mind, sign of the thought.

377
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:41,260
You are not saying to slow down your thoughts, but actually just discern a more general phenomenon

378
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,260
based on that.

379
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
Sure.

380
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,900
So that's when we pertains to the nature of the thought.

381
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,980
The unwholesome moving thought, wholesome moving thought, they shared it in a particular

382
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,180
aspect, they shared the same nature of a moving thought.

383
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:04,380
Then moving thought of the pertaining to unwholesome, moving thought pertaining to wholesome,

384
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:12,260
you can take it further, what are they having common, they are moving thought.

385
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:19,260
But as any moving thought, no matter of the movement, has in common, it's a thought.

386
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:28,500
Exactly, that's what it says, I'm walking fast, why am I walking, why is this body

387
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,500
being moving fast, why don't I slow it down, why don't I stand, why don't I have the

388
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:41,460
body in a non-moving position, not running fasts, I'm walking slowly, not walking slowly

389
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,940
standing, not standing, sitting down, not sitting down, laying down.

390
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,020
So what all of this push is having common, they are all body, they will pertain to the

391
00:33:51,020 --> 00:34:02,140
body for you refining in terms of the movement, in terms of the engagement, subtle and subtle.

392
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:08,500
But the thread of the clarity of pertaining to the thought or pertaining to the intent

393
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:15,420
of abandoning unwholesome remains, that thread stays through all of that.

394
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:24,460
Hence you use it to abandon the unwholesome movement of your thought.

395
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:30,780
When nothing else worked, you use it basically until the unwholesome falls off and then

396
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:39,860
okay, now you can start moving here, if you want, if there is a need for it.

397
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,220
It continues, if while he is giving attention to the stilling of a thought determination

398
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,820
of those thoughts, they still arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connected with

399
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:55,660
desire, with hate and with delusion, then with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed

400
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:02,260
against the roof of his mouth, he should beat down, constrain and crush, mind with mind.

401
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,300
When with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth, he beats

402
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:13,380
down, constrain and crushers, mind with mind, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected

403
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,220
with desire, with hate and with delusion are abandoned in him as a side.

404
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,820
With the abandoning of them, his mind becomes steadied in totally quieter, more to singen

405
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:29,220
us and compose. Just as a strong man might seize a weaker man by the head of shoulders

406
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:35,340
and beating down, constrain him in crushing, so too, when with his teeth clenched and his

407
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:40,740
tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth, a big who beats down, constrain and crushers,

408
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:47,940
mind with mind, his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singen us and composed.

409
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:58,660
When nothing else works, you still refuse to allow cowherd to go into that crop, because

410
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:06,460
no matter how hard it is, it's still not as hard as then in during the punishment, once

411
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,820
they've gone into the crop. So if you have to, you then just basically put the rope and

412
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:19,740
just pin them down until they come down. So if it exhausts you, but still the purpose

413
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:26,700
will be fulfilled. Keep the cowherd away from the green crop. It has become down, they

414
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,220
can't, they themselves will tie it up. So you just make your determination stronger

415
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,620
along the last thing, then they're the determination.

416
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:42,140
It's quite a simple thing to understand that, if you can see this is unhorsing, no, and

417
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,540
you just stop. And that's the thing, but what people don't understand then, the pain,

418
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:54,220
the sharp pain that will come seemingly because of the restraint, the fear, the panic,

419
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:00,500
the neurosis, everything else that comes, that's all part of that cowherd rebellion, that's

420
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:06,900
all part of the weaker man's. I mean, you don't know he's a weaker man until he comes

421
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:13,020
down based on your grip. Then you know you're stronger. So you'll find out you're stronger

422
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:26,140
if you prevail. But people usually, when he comes down to restraint and then the pain

423
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:36,460
comes and then the fear, various emotions now being caused by you become more sensitive

424
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,940
or whatever else, then people start developing lots of views on account of that. Views that

425
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:50,900
take them away from are quite simple. This is wholesome, this is unhorsing. You start

426
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:58,460
justifying it, or you start giving in. So you do need the right view to not give in to

427
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,100
that, because anybody can practice restraint, but restraint in itself does not lead to

428
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:09,300
the right view. It aids the right view to fulfillment, but it cannot bring you the right view

429
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:17,980
by itself. Again, if you don't know what Nibbana is, you can't possibly know what comes

430
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:25,180
closer to it, what drifts away from it. So you clarify as much as you can with what Nibbana

431
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:31,580
is, and then you start emulating the behavior, mental states, actions of that which is in

432
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:39,660
Nibbana. Acting like an Arhan, exactly. Not like, well, I'm not an Arhan yet, so I can

433
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:49,420
do it. No, you can't. If you're not an Arhan yet, you need to act like an Arhan, harder.

434
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:56,540
And yeah, you know, it might break somebody. Now, one people up to such a point that they

435
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:02,860
act, but that's the real risk. Because not to say like, act like an Arhan. No, no, no,

436
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,900
yeah, it doesn't mean act like an Arhan, act in front of others, means like, don't tolerate

437
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,340
anything and wholesome in your mind. If you don't tolerate anything and wholesome in your

438
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,140
mind, you won't be able to engage in anything and wholesome by your speech. If you can't

439
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,540
engage in anything and wholesome with your speech, you can't do anything and wholesome with

440
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:22,780
your body. It doesn't mean go around, you know, acting loftier than everybody else or

441
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,140
whatever else. No, act like an Arhan, it means emulate Arhan in your thoughts.

442
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:36,060
Yeah, and he's practicing. Yeah. And yeah, this is the ending of the sutra. Because when

443
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,700
a Bikku is giving attention to some sign and only to that sign, they rise in him evil

444
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,460
and wholesome thoughts, connected with desire, with hate and with delusion, then when he gives

445
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,540
attention to some other sign connected with what is wholesome, any such evil and wholesome

446
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:55,580
thoughts are abandoned in him and subside. With the abandoning of them, his mind becomes

447
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:01,180
steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness and confused. When he examines the danger

448
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,060
of thoughts, when he tries to forget those thoughts and does not give attention to them, when

449
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:12,860
he gives attention to the stilling of the thought of determination of those thoughts, or when

450
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,020
with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth, he beats down

451
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:23,500
from strange and crutches, mind with mind, any such evil thoughts and wholesome thoughts

452
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,660
are abandoned in him and his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness

453
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:35,700
and composed. Then this Bikku is then called a master of the causes of thought. He will

454
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,580
think whatever thought he wishes to think and he will not think any thought that he does

455
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,940
not wish to think. He has severed craving, flung with the fetters and with the complete

456
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:51,220
penetration of the conceit, he has made an end of suffering. This is what the Blessed

457
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,700
One said, the Bikus will satisfy him and delight it in the Blessed One's words.

458
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:24,720
I will.
