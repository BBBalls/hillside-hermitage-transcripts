1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But in a sense, basically, his strength was in the eye of the entire domain of the senses,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
not just in a risk of his strength in regard to the unholy, in regard to sensual.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So it was like the similar debate that Sutta, where you completely shunned it.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You shun everything. You see the danger, but you can't stay within it in a careful manner.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So you run away, you can't be through the whole thing in a way.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And sooner or later, you have to come back to it.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's like a people, like, it is strength, super-extraint.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And then just puff, give in, and then the damn breaks, and then just create worse mess than before.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So it's kind of oscillating, but there is no strength.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And in that talk, when I said, you know, like, say, like your senses, say a visual sense,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
like a wild dog, they want to pull you out.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So sometimes, okay, by default, you resist the pull, but sometimes you can constantly be resisting the pull,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
because it will weigh you down.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So then you have to pick your back out, whereby you resist the pull that is clearly unholy.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There is no negotiation there.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
However, if that wild dog is pulling you through something that is neutral,

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
you have to be careful to let, like, not resist that.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Because it's easy to give in, and then no.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I said, no, to everything.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's like what monks usually do, when they, or then, or something, they come,

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and that's when they become neurotic.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, no, no, Vinaya, Vinaya actually says the opposite.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes, but still.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No, no, no, but still, you have to allow for that space in between.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Like, the whole thing that we spoke before, like, putting the cloth down in women, which is actually not properly receiving the food.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And you can exactly see how it originated, was from a woman who might accidentally brush against your fingers when you were receiving it.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nothing to do with you, and Vinaya says clearly, if that thing happens, it's not an offense.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But obviously, you know, a doubtful mind, well, a mind that is not developed in regard to doubt, will be overwhelmed by that doubt eventually.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So then you know, they really haven't done anything wrong.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The Vinaya says they haven't done anything wrong.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It was unintentional.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But you can't sleep at night.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because basically you're caught in this neurotic kind of doubting paranoid sort of, whatever.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Spiling out of control.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So then what you do, then you make an exercise and you create your own rule, and to prevent even that from happening.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So no, I'll put a cloth down.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll put a cloth.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So then the woman can't touch me when she enters.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, but being touched, except it's not a problem.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So if that is bothering you, you should deal with that on that phenomenological level, not like of a level of running away and imposing another rule on top of a rule.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And that rule is unnecessary.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
More certainly, like it can be irrelevant, sure.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, you use a cloth or whatever.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But like in this case, for example, it actually goes against the Vinaya rule.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So because you're a neurosis, Vinaya became inadequate for you and you need more.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And that is exactly what happens in most of the core work.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In the sense of seeing a wild dog that's pulling me out, that's not a problem.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The problem is when he ends up in an unwholesome state and then I have to suffer and I can't do it.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's still the same wild dog.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Never was mine, never can be mine.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So then you just basically foresee the unwholesome scenarios where that dog will go and you prevent that and then let it go.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And then the dog will eventually come down as well.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But you mustn't go around just saying no to everything you see, everything you hear, everything you might doubt because you might doubt everything.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because that's going to be a very tight and unpleasant state.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And it is always.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's an exception.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So people do suffer and can't do it. And then even you say you have to avoid unwholesome.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't necessarily worry about wholesome.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's quite hard for them to allow that because everyone means taking up responsibility for the distinction.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, so now I have to rely on my own criteria that this is unwholesome and this is wholesome.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There is no external authority, there is an external community, external ministry, external Vinaya, external debt.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's kind of beforehand, but now I actually need to draw a line between good and between the bad and then stay behind that line.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And that's basically very hard thing to do.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But if a person does that, then they truly go beyond silver bath parmasks and silver bath parmasks as I'm sure I said before.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's somewhat people come and think, right, it's a ritual to ridicule it, bowing to a gold-gilded shrine or something. No, it's holding to a virtue and duty.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And that isn't quite a serious thing.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
As things that will actually free you.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Exactly. As things that they find themselves.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Directly resulting in liberating material.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Basically, you believe that your virtue and duty are directly easy to demand.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You want? It doesn't.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You couldn't.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It can enable you to draw a line. The line I was talking about.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And when you draw that line, then virtue and duty, as you have adopted before and it had to be there where you have adopted before and.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But once you draw a line, once you go to the criteria for that line, it falls away as virtue, as duty.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's why he is beyond silver, so to plan and then eventually around.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's why it's hard for people to draw that line because it relies on their own judgment.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There is no safety of tradition, safety of the history, the order of everything.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's just you, basically, sticking behind what you chose to do.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Obviously, you won't be able to wholesome me or rather rightly draw that line. If you haven't been adopting even externally these rights and rituals or are the virtue and duty, the norms.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But you must certainly not stay there because then, yeah, then you would be like, you know, a 50, 50 last month who is still as neurotic about his rule as on the first day and still not in the sort of manner.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But there's clearly going beyond sealer means going deeper.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, going beyond sealer means basically not depending on it, but not breaking it either.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What being unable to break it, to an extent, obviously.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Because, you know, that sealer is also defined in regard to, where else is sealer?

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I mean, like, all the necessary little, all the little circumstantial denial rules.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I talk about the basic principle of, you know, solubacy, lying, stealing, things that are in themselves and wholesome.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So that is the important bit because obviously, you know, virtue is important, but then people take it and then, even after, you know,

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the knowledge they might have gained to suit us or whatever, they're still unable to let go because they don't know the truth or are they feared if they let go,

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I mean, they were the opposite of non-sealer.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And that can happen if that sealer hasn't been established beforehand.

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So there is actually, you have to, basically, it's like building up a ship, developing sales, you know, gathering all the information about the design and engineering it and then doing the whole thing,

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
never putting it into water and trying it out, never, never like setting it to go to see if it's going to sink.

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So start singing quickly, pull it back, repair it, but you have to cross the other shore, not remain on this, clutching onto your little boat.

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Because what's the use of the boat, if you don't actually use it to sail away, into the same thing.

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So in terms of the food, that's like the, that's a quite good idea.

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You've seen that yourself, probably experienced it yourself in the monasteries, how people like, like, so, okay, I have to eat.

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So it's not like, you know, sexual intercourse or other unwholesome things that you don't have to do, you shouldn't.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But the food I have to eat, and then, obviously, you always have preferences.

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Like, the mouth, your tongue, the sense of taste as an independent animal is an independent animal.

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It prefers things, it wants things, it doesn't want certain other things.

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And that is kind of evolved, completely circumstantially.

103
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Based on the stuff you, when you were eating, you developed taste for certain things, you got sick of some other taste, that's it.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But obviously, for good to general, it's inseparable from the sense of self.

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So then when someone says, okay, you need to eat carefully.

106
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The other side you have to eat, but you have to eat carefully.

107
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like, it's your last, you know, kid your child, you need it just for survival.

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So, yeah, that is true.

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's what you need to have. I eat food purely so this body will still be alive so that I can practice.

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But over there, as it said, you need to be obsessed with a bunch of preferences.

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Or, certainly, try to avoid it.

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So you have people who get so mind-up, neurotic about eating food that they like.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Because I can't be mindful, basically, if the food I'm eating is the food I like.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's impossible. But actually, it isn't.

115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Mindfulness is nothing to do with whether what you're eating is what you prefer or what you don't prefer.

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mindfulness is actually indifferent to your preference, which is why it's the mindfulness that needs to be practiced.

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's not just the opposite preference.

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because I remember I met people who would just intentionally take opposite of what they really want to take.

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And it's like, well, the whole purpose of that is only to avoid responsibility for what you've taken.

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There's no mindfulness involved.

121
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So just you feel responsible if you take what you want to take.

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So you think you avoid that responsibility by then taking what you don't want to take.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But you don't see that you're responsible for that now.

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Because you can't avoid your responsibility by choosing a particular choice.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So you realize, why did I choose correctly for or what I don't?

126
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I am affected by the at-choice of choosing food.

127
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Even if I write down an impersonal algorithm that calculates for me what number of dishes to take on one day,

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have basically chosen the algorithm to be that which can give me the food to eat.

129
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's absolutely responsible for it.

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Either way, when you rely on an external thing, an external, like an algorithm, or external written law,

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
or somebody who has said, externally said, you will not be aware internally of your responsibility for your choices,

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
which means you won't be mindful properly.

133
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So then you realize, you don't actually have to fear your preferences.

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You have to fear losing mindfulness in regard to that.

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Or in regard to anything.

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's when that issue is set in.

137
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's when a video gets rekindled and so on.

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Not when you eat your favorite fruit.

139
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Because I want to get rid of my attachment towards fruit.

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Exactly.

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But they identify their attachment with their preference.

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But it's not preference is a preference of your taste.

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And your taste is not yours actually.

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That animal is independent of you.

145
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Always dragging around for so long, then you just,

146
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
but you're inseparable from it in your mind.

147
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But even then, your preference is not your attachment.

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's ignorance.

149
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
In regard to preferences, then you're attached right there.

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And that's the thing, because people in the course of their life

151
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
got so used to eating food that you prefer means eating it unmindfully,

152
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
are rarely lustfully.

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thus, now preference means that.

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I must avoid preference.

155
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I must deny.

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I must stop eating altogether as I were up into two giants.

157
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You could see the revolt, the rebellion of the mind against the preference

158
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
or the choice.

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But the white completely opposite way within the same domain of choice.

160
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So then they just started choosing the opposite.

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And more and more bizarre.

162
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So, oh, I will eat every second day.

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No.

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Then I will eat every third day.

165
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When that becomes not enough, I will eat every third day

166
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
from every fourth person,

167
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
on every third junction of the second town.

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's just completely randomly balanced.

169
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And only rice.

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And only rice.

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And then when that basically sees to induce novelty of the restraint.

172
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And you finally just told us before.

173
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Exactly what you do.

174
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Then you just go further.

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then I will stop eating all together.

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And that's the highest demand.

177
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's not.

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You never was.

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And that's what the Buddha said.

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He was slightly in a different relation.

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The different question.

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
When he asked me, why do you think that my disciples respect me?

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He said, well, because you eat little and you praise it in little.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You live under a tree.

185
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He said, no, that's not true.

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I sometimes eat a bowl full of food up to the brim of the back.

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's soft.

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's nice.

189
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And then I have another bowl full of food.

190
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So he had two arms, both.

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So he finishes with four arms, both of food.

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And then they ask him, oh Lord, enjoy.

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He said, yeah, sure.

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Fill it up again.

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And he eats it.

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And while at the same time he has disciples who get food every second day or something.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And it's a very coarse and horrible food.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And they live to cover you like a hemp throbes and under element of tree.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So if they were to respect him on a kind of...

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
With nothing behavior, they wouldn't.

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yet they had the utmost respect for it.

202
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why?

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because the devil is...

204
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, it's it beyond that as well.

205
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And they know it.

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And they know it because of his teaching thus, the respect is unshakable.

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Even if the Buddha just spends the rest of his days living in King's Palace as an eating all the time.

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Makes no difference.

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because if you're trying to adjust your food to adjust your mind.

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You're taking it from the wrong end.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, taking it from the wrong end.

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're trying to solve the problem from the wrong end.

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Or just mix your food in the bowl.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I told you I was doing that because people were talking about it.

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And I didn't mind to begin with it.

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But I did find it quite amusing.

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I did it on the second day of mixing everything.

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Fish, fruit yogurt, grapes and stuff.

219
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I started developing tastes for certain mixes.

220
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I started to like fish with grapes.

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Or with my mouth, it's full of all sorts of fruit, curry, rice and ice cream.

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Whatever was melted over.

223
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
My mind, again, if you eat it mindfully, if you relax.

224
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You might get focused on the pit of the mouth.

225
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That is in contact with the taste that you like.

226
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So there is no end to that separation of your preference.

227
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, not preference of choice, basically.

228
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Of what you want, what you like.

229
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Because you can't do that mechanically.

230
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because the mind, in the sense, will always pick on that.

231
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Even if you give it.

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And then if you just eat what you don't want.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Within that, you'll start preferring things.

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Like, what should this life less?

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So there's completely from the wrong end.

236
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What you need to do is eat mindfully whatever comes your way.

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So then, if you do need a criteria for, okay, but still, what should I eat?

238
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Because you know, I'm in a shop as a layman, perhaps,

239
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
who keeps the free subs.

240
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I mean, I'm in a supermarket.

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't want to buy.

242
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So what criteria?

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You use criteria, okay, why do you eat?

244
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why would I say it should be?

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
To be healthy.

246
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So you can practice.

247
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So then, choose the healthy food.

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So there is really horrible tasting healthy food.

249
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And there is something I really crave about.

250
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Well, either way, choose what's cheaper.

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Or choose something in between.

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Or choose what you like for making a point

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to not lose the mindfulness while you're eating that which you like.

254
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Because if your mindfulness becomes unshakable

255
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
in regard to a harmless preference of foods,

256
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
it's nothing unwholesome about preferring a watermelon

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
or a mango is a step preference.

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That does not induce lust.

259
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's ignorance in regard to it.

260
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's ignorance in regard to the preferred object

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that provides you with pleasure.

262
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's what induces lust.

263
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But beautiful objects, tasty objects,

264
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
nice sounds.

265
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
One of that is actual lust, and it was quite clear on that.

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So choose whatever you want to choose for whatever reasons

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
because that's beside the point.

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The point is eat it mindfully when you eat it

269
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and be mindful of the feeling of eating it.

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And never compromise with that.

271
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So soon enough, you won't take long

272
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
if you really commit to that sort of practice.

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You will basically just not care what you eat.

274
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Because you realize there was never a point.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Or like never, never that relates to the problem.

276
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It was mindfulness in regard to it.

277
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It was basically appropriating the domain of the taste

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
when you're following the food.

279
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Like, entertaining the notion

280
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that you are actually consuming that food.

281
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But when that food disappears down on your throat

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
when you swallow it, it's in you.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But it's not that food.

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
When it's in your stomach, it's as external as it was

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
when it was out on the shelf in the shop.

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Which means your stomach, then,

287
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
cannot be appropriated.

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It means the whole domain of your body, then, remains external to you.

289
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And that's what your mindfulness gets established upon.

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And that means you basically just stepped outside

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
of the whole domain of centrality.

292
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The centrality, the domain, whereby pleasure,

293
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that pertains to senses, can pull you.

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But being by stepping outside, they can't pull you anymore.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So the whole of preference is remained.

296
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But none of them is used any last anymore.

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Why? Because you're not there.

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can't be affected by it.

299
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There is mindfulness of that situation.

300
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, well, having your mindfulness established,

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
having your mind composed, in regard to that,

302
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
well, in regard to the right extent of that phenomenon

303
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
of the body, this body here and now.

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Because most people think, like, you know,

305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I mean, your skin is inside.

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And, you know, your lungs are inside,

307
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
your stomach is your mouth is kind of inside.

308
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And then inside inevitably has that, like, personal connotations.

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's, like, in a mind.

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And that's why, for an art hand, that kind of internal

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
disappears.

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So to speak, something that's used in suit

313
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
is different internal external.

314
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But when the Buddha says, what is left,

315
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
it's this conscious body.

316
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I out there, this conscious lamp of flesh

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
in the world, externally.

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And the naming matter, external.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So whichever way he looks,

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
internally externally, basically, he sees external

321
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and slightly less external, but still external,

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I, not mine.

323
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's what I mean by internally,

324
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and it needs to be clarified.

325
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because internally is taken as my internal dear.

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Suffering arises, like, you know, the true dukkha.

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The pure dukkha arises internally.

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
In that, like, sense of mind,

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
you're affected by it.

330
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, exactly.

331
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The mind, as it goes, is inside.

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And you're able, well, okay,

333
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
it's inside in relation to what you see from your senses,

334
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
but all of it, as a whole, it's outside.

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And here, yonder, yonder,

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and here, as in inside, are all out there.

337
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Here's also sort of strange practices

338
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
up here.

339
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Well, the yeast, we've tried to get, you know,

340
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the suffering of God's food,

341
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
regard to your desires,

342
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and so you create a new food.

343
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You blame the food, or you,

344
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you basically, you're so caught up,

345
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
in the desire around the food,

346
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you end up just thinking about food all the time.

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, trying to get beyond,

348
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
denying food, trying to replace the food.

349
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, something else.

350
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And one thing that some people like to

351
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
replace with is breathing,

352
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
breath aerials.

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, I have a bone there.

354
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes, that's another interesting.

355
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Well, what's the difference then?

356
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Because then, will you just take your breath?

357
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
As personal mind, you can't.

358
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And you depend on it.

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You have, there is, the body is dependent on a nutrient.

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah.

361
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And do you, to say that it's a game?

362
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's an illusion.

363
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Right.

364
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, no, that doesn't make sense.

365
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's an illusion.

366
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

367
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then, but breathing just air to nourish the body.

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Maybe some people can get better at the game.

369
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But that's what, that's what I mean.

370
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why would you stop there then?

371
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If you deny food, why don't you start denying breath?

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Which is what people did.

373
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Which is what the Buddha tried to do.

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes, stop breathing.

375
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And then you realize, no, this is a completely wrong way.

376
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You will never reach,

377
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
well, freedom and liberation by doing that.

378
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So what do you think? You know, imagine.

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I mean, imagine the hardcore ascetic

380
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
on a brink of death all the time, basically.

381
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Has already, you know,

382
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
his close friends in the world were the same.

383
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And at the same rate.

384
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And then he goes off and eats this milk rice

385
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
given to him by a woman.

386
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Just, and he eats this bowl of

387
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
probably quite delicious, basically healthy, fatty milk rice

388
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and they sing dirty.

389
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And it's over.

390
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What's he took two oranges?

391
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Where is your restraint?

392
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
He ate the milk rice

393
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
as a form ascetic.

394
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And he realized, actually, you know,

395
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
it's going to be waste of time.

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You have to go the other way.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah, because it's not waste of time.

398
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No, not waste of time.

399
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He's just like a reaction in regard to it.

400
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And that's what it's,

401
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
a similar debate,

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
imagine an entire debate.

403
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And that's what it's done.

404
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's what it says.

405
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The first, basically,

406
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
traps and controls by Mara.

407
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He doesn't understand some.

408
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Other, we'll actually see that.

409
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And they were like, oh, look, Mara is actually there.

410
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And he traps people.

411
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And that is bad.

412
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So what they do,

413
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
they debate completely,

414
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
deny it, and they run away from it.

415
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Into the mind.

416
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
When there is no debate,

417
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
there is no Mara, there is nothing.

418
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Because, basically, if you don't eat food,

419
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
you will not be bothered by preferences,

420
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and you go to food.

421
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So just throw the whole thing.

422
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But you can't sustain that.

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And the Buddha himself said that so many times.

424
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Which means, then,

425
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that hurt eventually,

426
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
when there isn't anything left in those margins,

427
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
where the debate is set, and they, again,

428
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
eat in amwarely, and on account of that,

429
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Mara does what he wants.

430
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Then the third, the third,

431
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
sees the first group, sees the second group,

432
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and then realizes, well,

433
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
what if we stay within the debate?

434
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But he didn't worry.

435
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And then, always,

436
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
we'll step ahead and say, well,

437
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
then they start arguing or reviews.

438
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
They might be living withdrawn from Centralite.

439
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They start arguing or reviews,

440
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and they find that, then the fourth era

441
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
doesn't even argue or reviews.

442
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But at the principle of Centralite,

443
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
it's basically staying within the debate,

444
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
because you have no choice really.

445
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And by shunning the debate, you give power to the debate.

446
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So stay within the debate,

447
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
but never, ever eating it unwarely.

448
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So, literally, imagine,

449
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the further rest of your life,

450
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
whatever food you put in your mouth,

451
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
will have potential to have a hook in it.

452
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But you have to eat it.

453
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So every, every most sort of food that comes to you,

454
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
will have a debate hidden inside it

455
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
for the rest of your life.

456
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Or, have a possibility of having a base.

457
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You don't quite know. You can only have foods.

458
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So how would you eat that food?

459
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Very carefully.

460
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
For the rest of your life.

461
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So you have to put it in your mouth,

462
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
piece by piece,

463
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
bit by bit. Don't let it all around you.

464
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Don't lose mindfulness.

465
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's just bite in it,

466
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
because it will rip your mouth.

467
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And then, oh, there is a debate,

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
but you haven't been eating like a maniac,

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
carelessly.

470
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So you can feel it. You can pull it out

471
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
without actually arming yourself.

472
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You can eat the rest.

473
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And the further rest of your life,

474
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
in regard to everything you put in your mouth.

475
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And that's all it says, basically.

476
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And that, that's similar,

477
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
of course, in the desert.

478
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That's exactly what it says.

479
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So you really have to eat.

480
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay, well, we have to kill this child,

481
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
it's a lie by the way.

482
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But at least it will give us a chance to survive.

483
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And maybe have some more children.

484
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And they may commit this children.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Whatever it is, it's always best of the horrible scenario.

486
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So you might quite like that child.

487
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I mean, the taste of it.

488
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
If you start eating.

489
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah, because you need a starving,

490
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
fried meat.

491
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
No, no, no, no.

492
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You still have to eat it.

493
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So how do you eat it?

494
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You need to care for it.

495
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Don't forget it's your only child that you just killed,

496
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
in order to survive.

497
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Which means you won't forget the purpose why you eat it.

498
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Which means you won't get careless.

499
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And certainly, you want results to food

500
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
for mere central pleasure.

501
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You need them.

502
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Then you want a problem eating once a day.

503
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's, it's also seen as a food you see.

504
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
A something which will bring,

505
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
will give you some sort of experience.

506
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Oh, I know it's a good experience.

507
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That's a completely different thing.

508
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I know what you mean.

509
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But they're just a whole new level of wrong.

510
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's not being worth addressing it.

511
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah, it's just that it's such a,

512
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
it's a very common and normal thing

513
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
for most people.

514
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's just food is a nice thing.

515
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yeah.

516
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And they just enjoy it together.

517
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah.

518
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
They just have this taste.

519
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah.

520
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But that's, that those are people that don't even have a concept of what the practice will,

521
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
if any kind of this trend would be,

522
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
they're just completely forgotten.

523
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You know, they're the first hurt.

524
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It doesn't even recognize that it's actually been trapped.

525
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's not even completely in control,

526
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
but they don't even recognize it.

527
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So, nothing you say to them.

528
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We'll change that and I'll ask them themselves.

529
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's it.

530
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Right.

531
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I mean, for goodness sake, people go as far as to...

532
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
mystify the food, Christians,

533
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Christians.

534
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Good grief.

535
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I go, you believe, oh yeah, this, this,

536
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
this fried up

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
loaf of bread, whatever I'm eating,

538
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I was given to it.

539
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I go, directly, by God.

540
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This is the, the gods.

541
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Paul, they are meeting.

542
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Increation, through devotion,

543
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
if I remember correctly, it's been ages ago.

544
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
When I, when I had a friend,

545
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
in Krishna, with God for his lunches.

546
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah, we were going there for the food, really.

547
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This is a nice food.

548
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And he was a nice guy.

549
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But I was really interested in whatever he's saying.

550
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So, he just put up with it.

551
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So, you can eat.

552
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But, I don't remember.

553
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I remember basically the whole, the whole idea was

554
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
this, this, like, the more you eat,

555
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
the more of a, like, a, a, a, a, a,

556
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

557
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

558
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

559
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

560
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

561
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
a, a, a, a, a, a,

562
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
a, a, a, a, a, a,

563
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

564
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a

565
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:02,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

566
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,000
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, aIf

567
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
da, a Aboriginalphot,

568
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:01,000
a, a, l, a, a, a,

569
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,620
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

570
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Supplements, that's not a issue.

571
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,620
Only if you think this may be, you'll be, you know, you have last full thoughts.

572
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,620
Well, you have last full thoughts, because you have last full body.

573
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,620
I think this may be my reminder of that.

574
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,620
And if you're not developed, you're regarded, then it may be me.

575
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,620
You just need to have reproductive organs.

576
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,620
That's it.

577
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,620
So, yeah, blaming the specific food, you know, don't need those foods.

578
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,620
I mean, I'm not talking from the health perspective.

579
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,620
I'm talking from the spiritual perspective.

580
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,620
And for those people, you know, that's why I often spit it out.

581
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,620
It is linked with health.

582
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
With yogis or whatever else.

583
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,620
You know, I help the food, my spirit is helpful.

584
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,620
Good luck with that.

585
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,620
What you're going to do when your body gets sick, because it's all right.

586
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,620
And you hold your whole life a spiritual development.

587
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
And bodily pushes and stuff.

588
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Gone.

589
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,620
All your attainment is dependent on your healthy body.

590
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Yeah, and that's not an attainment.

591
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,620
And that's my favourite one.

592
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,620
Not even that.

593
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,620
Not even people who are right, young.

594
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Yeah.

595
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,620
So...

596
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,620
No, it's a completely misplacement.

597
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,620
And it's easy, easy for people to do, because obviously...

598
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,620
The pure number, the real number is that it's so hard, subtle to understand.

599
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,620
I mean, do you see how many people could just travel,

600
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,620
cross the idea of being mindful of an arisen thing?

601
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,620
Like, without resorting to some sort of, you know, scientific explanation,

602
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,620
or say, I was constantly, you know, just be mindful of an arisen thing.

603
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:49,620
Be mindful of the enduring arisen thing, arisen thing that endures.

604
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,620
And the confusion is already set.

605
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,620
So if it's the same thing, like five seconds ago, and the thing now,

606
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,620
well, that's not the same, but it is the same thing.

607
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,620
But it isn't, because it was five seconds.

608
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,620
So there is a change.

609
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,620
We did that same thing.

610
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,620
But it's still the same thing, because you're still talking about it as a same thing.

611
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,620
That's changing in a different level.

612
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,620
And that's already mind-blowing.

613
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,620
For most of people.

614
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,620
I think that's quite normal back in the day.

615
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,620
That kind of authentic sort of recognition of...

616
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
You know, they didn't think they were in time.

617
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,620
They didn't think time was constantly changing.

618
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
And everything is in the flux.

619
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,620
They had no notion, such as those.

620
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,620
So the human are done with something's first time, and they were before, even immediately,

621
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
land.

622
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,620
It didn't make sense.

623
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,620
Because they didn't have so many wrong reviews coming together.

624
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,620
Now there's other cases.

625
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:47,620
With food, knowing that, or knowing that the body means nutrient,

626
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,620
and contemplating that, that can be a huge point.

627
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,620
Yeah, depending on the term.

628
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,620
And that's our secondary.

629
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,620
And for your concern should be mindful in regard to the need for the food.

630
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,620
Basically, everything you put in your mouth, as it might have a sharp fish bonnet,

631
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,620
or something that if you buy it will break your tooth.

632
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,620
And you will be unable to eat it carefully.

633
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,620
If you cultivate that actually.

634
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,620
And you will become unable to descend down into your belly as yours.

635
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
And regard it as internal need.

636
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,620
Which means you will stop going down into the center of the maze.

637
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,620
Where those pleasures can exercise power is over here.

638
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,620
We say it's more powerful food.

639
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
Or sex.

640
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:45,620
Well, sex would be more powerful.

641
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,620
But food would be more fundamental.

642
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,620
If you're hungry, you won't have thought of sex.

643
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,620
In that sense, food is more fundamental.

644
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,620
But the pool of food, you know, you're hungry.

645
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,620
It will never be as feverish and crazy as pool of sex.

646
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:10,620
A pool of sex is just a combination of all the pools.

647
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,620
Yeah, exactly.

648
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,620
All of the animals are pulling in.

649
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,620
So all of the senses are intoxicated by the sexual desire.

650
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,620
As you know, in your opinion, you're good to know.

651
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,620
In a single form, then a form of man, the sets of mind of a woman,

652
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,620
and a form of all the sense of mind of a man.

653
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,620
And then those little sights, sounds, mouth, face, touch,

654
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,620
as that of a man for a woman and a woman for a man.

655
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,620
So basically, yeah, you have all five pools going for it.

656
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,620
Food is fundamental, which is why, obviously,

657
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,620
it's completely unnecessary to be done at all,

658
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,620
and it shouldn't be done at all.

659
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,620
While the food you have, you know, you have to eat and engage with it,

660
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,620
but then you have to sort of start separating.

661
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,620
You know, eating the stuff around the bed, not with the bed.

662
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Give yourself to be mindful then of the...

663
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,620
You can't.

664
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,620
There's no mindfulness here to recognize mindfulness

665
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,620
as an arisen, established thing.

666
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
It's impossible to have that.

667
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
And the sexual desire, what?

668
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:21,620
Sexual pool that you get, it suggests that you engage at the same time.

669
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
And that's what the Buddha meant when he said,

670
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,620
it's impossible to engage in a sexual intercourse

671
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,620
without being held by the central perceptions.

672
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,620
Without your mind being held by that.

673
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,620
It's impossible to not perceive sensuality

674
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,620
and engage in the actual act of sensuality

675
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,620
because that act is defined by the perceived sensuality.

676
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,620
But non-mindfulness.

677
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Well, of course, yeah.

678
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,620
Yeah.

679
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,620
The non-developed mind.

680
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,620
Yeah.

681
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,620
So you can know, you could try,

682
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,620
I mean, obviously, persons having sex,

683
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,620
they can really be in a present moment.

684
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,620
Well, you're always in a present moment.

685
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,620
You're always in a present moment?

686
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,620
With it, but it means nothing.

687
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,620
They don't even know what a present moment is there.

688
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Yeah.

689
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Which is when people practice being in the present moment.

690
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Just going with it.

691
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
There's nothing wrong with being in the past moment.

692
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
The future moment.

693
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,620
But what if you're mindful of it?

694
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,620
The person who enables you strengthen your mind

695
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,620
with mindfulness,

696
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,620
or, let's say, strengthen your mind.

697
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,620
You have a mindfulness.

698
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,620
And you've got food.

699
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,620
There will...

700
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
Well, sexual...

701
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
No, no, no, no.

702
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:42,620
First, by not engaging in any form of sexual intercourse or activity.

703
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,620
And then being mindful in regard to the food,

704
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,620
then that can lead you out of the central,

705
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,620
central domain,

706
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,620
or rather have your mind established above central domain.

707
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,620
But you can be mindful as much as you want around the food

708
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,620
if you spend your day engaging in sexual thoughts

709
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,620
and kind of cultivating and detaining those,

710
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,620
you won't work.

711
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,620
So that's why it doesn't need to be abandoned.

712
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,620
You have to stop engaging in it beforehand

713
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,620
and then you can start developing the practice within that.

714
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Hence, the awareness here comes first.

715
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,620
Because both are single-game.

716
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,620
You have a hungry stomach.

717
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,620
And then basically demanding senses, demanding food pleasure.

718
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:36,620
Well, in this case, obviously,

719
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,620
senses demanding food because they're hungry.

720
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
And basically,

721
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,620
attending to their hunger by eating,

722
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,620
provides you with pleasure.

723
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,620
Even if it's not necessarily food that you prefer.

724
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
So that's already...

725
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,620
If you're not mindful, that's already a hook, that's already a belt.

726
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
That's what I mean.

727
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,620
Like you can try running away from your preferences for as much as you want.

728
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,620
But that's beside the point.

729
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,620
The point is that you may mindful through and through.

730
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,620
But you eat whether you prefer it or not.

731
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Why? Because even the food that you don't prefer.

732
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
When you are hungry,

733
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,620
it will provide you with simple pleasure of being food for your hungry stomach.

734
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,620
And that pleasure, it can be essential pleasure if you are hungry and you got it.

735
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Doesn't matter if the food you put in your mouth is agreeable or not.

736
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Because both have or might have a belt.

737
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,620
It doesn't say that only food that you prefer has a belt.

738
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
And you should avoid it.

739
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,620
No, does it say food that you hate hasn't been known?

740
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
It says food has a belt.

741
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
Food might be a belt.

742
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:48,620
So that's why actually preference or not is completely seconded thing.

743
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,620
Once you've been rooted in practice,

744
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
you've been rooted in the mindfulness.

745
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,620
And then there would have been preferences.

746
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,620
They were based on other preferences.

747
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,620
They were completely based on just pure pleasure.

748
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
These are the pleasure.

749
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,620
And they will fall off.

750
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:13,620
Because now all of them require that attitude of non-mindfulness at the very root.

751
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:19,620
But once you start out with the other preferences won't necessarily fall off.

752
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,620
You can still tell now this is a nice food.

753
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,620
That was not so nice food.

754
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
That was quite rough.

755
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,620
Oh, the food smells really bad.

756
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,620
I even have a gag reflex.

757
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,620
But that's nothing to do with just the fact.

758
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,620
This is about how those hardest animals respond to it.

759
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,620
But if you eat it unmindful, even the most horrible food in the world,

760
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:49,620
you still remain as a probably even more enslaved because you think you're not enslaved

761
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,620
by avoiding preference, preferred food.

762
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,620
Well, actually, you remain even like equally enslaved by thinking you're less enslaved

763
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,620
while that adds another layer of slavery to it.

764
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,620
That you yourself create it.

765
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:08,620
And that's why you do have those extreme ascetics who eat feces or who knows what.

766
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,620
Just horrible, horrible stuff.

767
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,620
And there wouldn't be only one who has a brilliant new day of life.

768
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Probably even worse.

769
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:33,620
So, yeah, I mean to be dispassionate towards food.

770
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:39,620
It's not because food tastes bad, not because it's horrible food,

771
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,620
but because it's there.

772
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,620
Because Mara might have placed the bait in it.

773
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,620
The bait has nothing to do with agreeable or disagreeable food.

774
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
It has to do with Mara.

775
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,620
It's in food.

776
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,620
So, as I said, you don't actually have to have the food, you have to eat.

777
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,620
So, then you do, okay, so I just have to eat this food.

778
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:08,620
So, then I'll just take great care to avoid falling and biting and chewing into the bait.

779
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,620
And that's it.

780
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,620
And that's the body's business, food.

781
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,620
Yeah, yeah, that's not your business, really.

782
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Which you have to, you know, tend to every day, every day.

783
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,620
So, means every day you need to be mindful of the bait.

784
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,620
Every day you need to be mindful of the trap and the snare.

785
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:37,620
And then, yeah, oh yeah, so the practice is basically about every day mindfulness.

786
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,620
And the repetitive drilling.

787
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,620
Food is quite a burden, isn't it?

788
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,620
It's burdensome.

789
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,620
Well, no, Mara is a burden.

790
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Because he's relentless in having that big place in the food.

791
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,620
So, but again, he has everything right to do so.

792
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,620
Because the food belongs to him.

793
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,620
The food, the taste, and the tongue belongs to him.

794
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,620
The sights and eyes belong to him.

795
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
The sound and ears belong to him.

796
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,620
You remember this, because it's because people take that which belongs to Mara.

797
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,620
Mara does what he wants, well, with them, but I can't have it.

798
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,620
And what is that he takes?

799
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
It's the eye and the sights.

800
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
It's the ear and the sound.

801
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
It's the nose and the smells.

802
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,620
So, you know, it's the same your senses, actually, belong to him.

803
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,620
So, it's every right to put whatever he wants in it.

804
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,620
And it's you who keep biting carelessly.

805
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,620
And then, hooking yourself like a mindless fish.

806
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,620
And that's the deal.

807
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,620
That's what some sorry is.

808
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,620
That's what an existence is.

809
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:15,620
A person can complain about it, feel sorry for himself, but that's just how it is.

810
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:22,620
And you would complain about it, feel sorry, because you're still refusing to give up your ownership of those things.

811
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,620
I still feel entitled to your eyes and to the sights.

812
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Like that was the first.

813
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:58,620
I can't wait for you.
