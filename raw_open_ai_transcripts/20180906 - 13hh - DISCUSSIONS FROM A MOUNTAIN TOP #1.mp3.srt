1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You can see me as a bag drop.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There's only if you could describe me Bana, what is that?

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What is your aim?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Your aim is Nibana, what is it?

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You mean if somebody out gives that as an answer to a question?

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's in on my aim is Nibana?

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well that's the thing actually, understanding correctly what Nibana is means you would be at least a sort of Bana

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Fully developing that understanding means yeah you have now developed Nibana as it became an arhant

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
As to what it is, well as the suitors would describe its absence of greed, aversion and delusion

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Complete absence in the sense of the possibility of greed, aversion or delusion is impossible

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So the mind has fully understood it and fully got rid of it

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So it's not a place that one goes to?

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No exactly, it isn't, it's not a...

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not a magical realm that kind of gets one enters upon, if upon some certain practice of a special meditation technique or something like that

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not a place you go into and replace what you know with it

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's really what you know now, your experience as it is, what you have now

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Remove greed, aversion, delusion, remove possibility of greed, possibility of aversion, possibility of delusion from it

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's what Nibana becomes, that's what Nibana is

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's why we would say cooling down, literally, cooling down of the fires of passion, anger and so on

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So you cool this thing down, this experience, this life you have, you cool it down

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
To the point of being irreversible, you cannot go back and be entered again by greed, aversion or delusion

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's been fully frozen to the point of these three things dying out and now they cannot reappear

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And that's a developed Nibana

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So you can see that in order to cool something down, you need to have it, you need to acknowledge it, you need to admit it

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You need to see where the work in cooling it down lies

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're not replacing it with some new world or new realm or new meditation experience

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're actually fully understanding what you already have, so you don't need anything new, whatever it's necessary for Nibana

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You already have it, everybody already has it

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's why the Buddha would refer to the element of Nibana in everyone's experience

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
As in possibility of developing the phenomenon which is Nibana, that means the element of Nibana is present

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's not about belief

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's not about belief

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You see, when people took it as a belief, that's when they started saying we are already in Nibana

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because Nibana is already there

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's when you fail to see the difference between the possibility and the actual development of something

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, Nibana is there as a possibility

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But saying that you have developed Nibana means you need to have it as your actual experience

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
As in you need to do the work of getting rid of greed, aversion and delusion

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You will, hatred, sensuality, all of that

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
When Nibana is the perfected human being, and it's not perfect at all

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Pretty much, but then see, perfect human being basically

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's certainly a perfection, but you wouldn't refer to that person as a human being anymore

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Because human means going with the nature, going with the grain, going with the current, going with desires

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Going with the cravings and so on, that's what makes humans human

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So you actually, you cease to be a human

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Arhand is not human anymore

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If that's the designation you would use for a human

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But yeah, overall, sure, as an individual, he still protects as a being in a human realm

49
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But really what makes human human

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Are these things that you sort of undo and relinquish as another hunt, as somebody who is enlightened?

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Overcoming your humanity

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, pretty much, first you need to overcome the immorality and non-virtue

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But then you need to overcome that as well

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's why you're not really measurable by any human standards

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He's not like a good human or a bad human, a good person or bad, no, he's not a person anymore

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's done

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
His abandon, relinquish the ownership

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Of the slightest sort of appropriation of his own senses, his own aggregates

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yvonne is also called the non-appropriation in English, another

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, non-appropriation

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Or the undetermined

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The undetermined, yeah, because the things that are determined for a human

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
For an unenlightened, unenlightened being

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Are things that are determined by greedy version delusion

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you remove that and there is nothing determining things as mine anymore

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Hence, they've experienced the undetermined

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The experience of the undetermined

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But it's a real experience as such

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's why Nibbana is a thing, a phenomena, a dama

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If you can't really show people that Nibbana, can you show them?

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No, of course not

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, you can guide them to it, but even that will not necessarily result in them getting to it

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Unless they have made the effort themselves

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So you can point at it, you can describe it

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You can lay out the way that somebody can practice towards it, but unless they practice

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like getting real, getting absolutely real

77
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sure

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Being honest with your situation, it's up to me, it's not

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, not just being honest with your situation, but also recognizing

81
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The Buddha would refer to it as measure the task

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like a person would go and listen to whatever

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Somebody he deems wise, somebody he deems that he can help him

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And then he would ponder on the meaning of what's being said and what needs to be done

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Once he starts grasping the meaning, he can see, oh, okay, this is the amount of effort

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is what I need to do to measure the task

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that is absolutely necessary in order to be able to do it

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But most people don't, they kind of omit that whole thing of holon

89
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What does this actually mean?

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It might make me feel good, it might be very inspiring for me

91
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But do I understand what it means

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When I read the suttas or when I face instruction

93
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's sort of directing me towards Nibbana, am I aware of the actual meaning of it

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
As in what exactly I need to do?

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And most people are not encouraged to think like that

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's most like, okay, you're inspired, that's great

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now here is a meditation technique that you just do mechanically

98
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And then the experience you have

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If it's substantial enough, if it affects you significantly enough

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Then we can interpret it as Nibbana or as something leading to Nibbana

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But Nibbana is not an interpretation

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Any, any basically, any part of developing a wisdom

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Does not partake in interpretation, certainly not by external terms

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It protects the direct understanding of the meaning of it

105
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Which then results in direct freedom from suffering

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And hence, that's the greatest verification of your wisdom

107
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You know you're right because you cannot suffer a mid-suffering

108
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You cannot engage in your will, you cannot engage in centrality

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You cannot engage in craving or distraction or delusion

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And even if the whole world says, no, that's wrong

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You know that they're wrong because you had one free from suffering

112
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's why Aruhant, Anagami Sakadami, Suddhupana, basically

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They had one, well Aruhant is completely developed against the grain

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Against the grain of nature and the outputs of the mind

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And intentions and cravings and feelings and so on

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Suddhupana is somebody who got, he understood it

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He understood what it is, but he hasn't fully developed it

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He hasn't fully went upstream, so to speak

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Because, as I said, it's not like a theory or ideology

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That you are sort of justifying and making it like an argument proof or something

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No, it's directly verifiable in your experience

122
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Why? Because you have the criteria, suffering and freedom from it

123
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sensuality and freedom from it, ill will and freedom from it

124
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So you're free from those things, not because you've been running away from those things

125
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Or you've been hiding or sort of trying to manage the circumstances

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So you don't get challenged externally

127
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No, you're free from those things because amidst those things

128
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The mind cannot be overwhelmed by them, so you don't engage

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not even a matter of restraint anymore, it becomes impossible

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Once understanding has fully taken place, it becomes impossible to suffer, amidst suffering

131
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And as I said, that is the greatest verification a person can have

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That they've been practicing rightly

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There's no verification from others saying that

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No, of course not

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well done

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean, the others can verify it as they did in the suitors basically

137
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Not by, yes, I see the magic blue light aura around, he said he's another hand

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But by talking to that person, interrogating them

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
To the point of discerning the subtle meanings and they were like, yeah

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Because another hand would know what another other hand needs has to have understood beforehand

141
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So he would know that, which means through questioning you could see the extent of other persons understanding

142
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And that was also a way of progress as well

143
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The Buddha would often encourage that in the suitors

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Saying the monks would sort of interrogate each other, not like for the sake of argument

145
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But for the sake of pressing for the meaning, you wouldn't leave anything unturned

146
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So you'd be drilling and delving and basically making effort to understand

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And then being questioned by your translation, by spiritual companions and so on

148
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Again, it's like, have you understood this, have you?

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And if you thought you did, well, you will then be able to convey it

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
To somebody else who did understand it

151
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But then again, if you thought you did, but you haven't

152
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This questioning can actually spur you to make further effort

153
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because you realize, oh, okay, I haven't been considering this or that

154
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Or whatever the questions contain

155
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But again, you can see that most of the modern practice today, when it comes to Buddhism, meditation, it's nothing to do with it

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's just watching nostrils cross your legs, sit in lotus, and that's it

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And it will happen, or whatever

158
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And what you just said, it seems that discussing the Dharma is useful

159
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Gone, shall I tell you a sentence?

160
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah, discussing the Dharma is useful, provided that at least one of those people has understood it

161
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Otherwise, it's blind leading the blind

162
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
In other words, two underlying persons, people who haven't even understood what Sotipati is

163
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They can discuss the Dharma all they want

164
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It won't result in knowledge, as in, like, you pair two ignorance together

165
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's not going to amount to knowledge

166
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because Patujan's experience is top to bottom ignorance

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So you cannot accidentally stumble upon, or even find the right reference towards that ignorance

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's what they said, the absolutely necessary condition for arising on the right view is utterance of another

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Of another who hasn't understood it

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And, paired with that, they need to have the right attention, as in, they need to know

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Basically how to hear it, how to dismiss it, how to attend to it

172
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And how to practice that right utterance

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So, then, once, see, like, for example, two Sotipanas could enable each other better in practice if they were to discuss it

174
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Because it would just be reminding them of what they already know, but they haven't pressed it far enough in terms of understanding

175
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Or even better, Sotipana talking to an other hand

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But Patujan, it can only remain in Patujan

177
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Or be dealing with mundane terms

178
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, exactly, it might be helping each other how to manage their suffering better

179
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But Sotipana is not management of suffering, it's the first step of uprooting it

180
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
As in, you know exactly how to approach it

181
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And that's already freedom from suffering, you know, to a great degree

182
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So, what about speech, truthful speech?

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Right speech

184
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Which you said, so you wouldn't say that discussing the Dhamma or your concerns, your spiritual concerns

185
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
With other people who are also on the same kind of path

186
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You wouldn't say that's right

187
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, if you define Noble by that which Patakes to, like, sort about your higher, then it isn't of course

188
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now, it can help people because in a sense of, it can make them make the effort on the personal level further

189
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
By having an intelligent feedback, even if it's another Patujan

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What they should not expect is that the conversation, the discussion itself, results in some great epiphany

191
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But in the same sense you come across a new Sutra or you come across other wrong view that then you actually understand better

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And by doing so you clarify what the right view is

193
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So, of course, that's all thanks to their personal effort

194
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Towards understanding the nature of suffering and freedom from it

195
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But yes, if the other person is equally sort of striving as you are

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then that discussion can sort of just, well, at least hint at certain directions

197
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Of your reflection and of your contemplation

198
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Good, both of those people say, well, I'm not enlightened

199
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Are you enlightened? I'm not enlightened

200
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well, no, yeah, exactly, there is a difference between that

201
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You have some of these people debating just because it's pleasant

202
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Hey, let's have a discussion about it and just bounce ideas off each other

203
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, I mean, that's utterly pointless

204
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But if you know your situation, the beautiful Patujaner, you know that nothing sort of

205
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Supremundane, so just speaking, come out of this discussion with another Patujaner

206
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But you do it just to highlight your ignorance further

207
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Which means you did begin with that self-honest attitude

208
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But in that same sense, you don't even need the other person, just pick up any philosophy book

209
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And look it like, okay, this is supposedly the wrong view

210
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But have I understood it why and to what extent and where exactly it's wrong?

211
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So you're not looking for faults, you're generally adopting that view

212
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
In order to be able to understand the extent of it

213
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And by doing so, that's why often the Buddha would describe all these wrong views

214
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They were present at the time

215
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Because by fully understanding their extent, one would be much closer to the right view

216
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So, as I said, discussing with another equal intelligent, equally self-transparent person, that can help

217
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Stop making noise

218
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That can help, in the same sense, reading other books or other teachings can help

219
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But not if you don't have that necessary self-transparent basis

220
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Come here, come here

221
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So ideally, you want to be discussing these things with a sotupana

222
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Someone who has a sotupana

223
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Because otherwise, I think it is just stabbing in the dark

224
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And even if you actually do

225
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Even if you do actually stab something, you wouldn't know

226
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So that's why I mean, like, hey, you can profit from it if you're already very self-transparent

227
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
In the same sense, you would profit from reading other views, other things

228
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So you're not looking for faults, you're not covering it up, you haven't just adopted the belief that this is wrong

229
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But you're genuinely understanding the extent of it and why it's wrong and how it's wrong

230
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So, for a person who wants to discuss with a sotupana, how can you find one?

231
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, exactly, he has no reference

232
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What is his criteria?

233
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What the closest to the right criteria can get is this self-transparency, being honest with oneself

234
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And not being dismissive of other views

235
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Even if they are not pleasing to you

236
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Because usually people's criteria, for the views, opinions, ideologies, beliefs, is basically emotional

237
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This is pleasing to me for whatever, there is maybe a small kind of degree of reasoning involved

238
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But mostly, this is emotionally pleasing to me, thus this is my view, and that's why I'm defending it

239
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And that's why I'm criticizing other views

240
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Not because I have understood my view or I understood other views, no, it's just because

241
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
circumstantially I adopted it and now I'm defending it at all costs

242
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So that attitude cannot, that attitude is basically the main impediment, that's like the wrong attention

243
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
When one looks, and the Buddha said they're looking for faults in a speaker, will prevent you understanding what he means

244
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And by not getting the meaning, then you might actually sort of cross over a sotupana or even an other hand

245
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Who's been speaking, you've been listening to it, but you were not paying proper attention

246
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
As in you were dismissing it, or not listening to carefully enough, and that's it, it's gone

247
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And your views, your wrong views, your wrong criterias remain unaffected

248
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Which means you're non-advisor, non-advisor even by having a Buddha himself in front of you teaching you

249
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So that's what I mean, if you're self-transparent, honest, with yourself, so you know your situation, you know that you're not free from suffering

250
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Not free from sensuality, or greed, or aversion

251
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And then you also recognize the inevitability of having to have some views

252
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But you don't judge your situation through your views, you judge your views through a situation

253
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
As in you can't help having views, but at the same time you recognize, well, I'm not free from suffering

254
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm not free from greed, aversion, delusion, I'm not a sotupana, basically

255
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Which means the views that I do hold in regard there, I should put in question

256
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because it's because of those very views that I'm not free from suffering, free from greed, aversion, I'm not a sotupana yet

257
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But people might think one thing, then they might think about the second thing of their views, but they never put it together and see that that's a contradiction

258
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because you can't have put two generous views that are right and not be a sotupana

259
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because right view means sotupana, so if you don't have the right view, you can't entertain the notion that you're put

260
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Sorry, if you're not a sotupana, if you're a sotupana, if you're a sotupana, you can't entertain a notion, did you also have right views?

261
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And that attitude is unpleasant, because it's like living in perpetual doubt of your own existence

262
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And that's very, it can be very anxious, very, yeah, like lots of sort of concern

263
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Because any single view that you look into, you realize, well, this might be wrong

264
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Then any confidence that you might have had as a bhutujana gets completely undone, demolished, but that's the whole point

265
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So that's why when the practice of dhamma, when thinking and reflecting upon views, it's not optional anymore, it's existential basically

266
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You need to do it, you need to clarify it, because you realize the parallel of it

267
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You can't just simply adopt a belief that's

268
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, you can adopt a belief, but if you're self-honest, if you do have that honesty, you wouldn't be able to

269
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
As appealing as a belief might be, you wouldn't be able to

270
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, you would be able to at the expense of honesty, self-honest

271
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But if you realize that self-honestity should not be compromised ever

272
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Then that's your safeguard against adopting and proliferating things just simply upon a belief

273
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So then if you adopt something, it would be after heavy scrutiny

274
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And even then, you wouldn't adopt it as a belief

275
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You would adopt it pretty much as a strategy towards your practice of freedom from suffering

276
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Which means if that strategy is not bearing any fruit and you're not free from suffering

277
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You're going to be upgrading it or changing it, and you won't be afraid to do it

278
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And faith

279
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Well, that's there, you can have a belief without faith, but you can have faith without a belief

280
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So the faith that we are talking about is the, it's in the suit, as you mentioned, and I might have spoken about it before

281
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The faith we are talking about is the faith that you would have, that a person would have in a doctor

282
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
As in, you recognize your situation through that self-honest scrutiny of yourself, basically

283
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You recognize that you need help as in you are a subject to suffering, you are prey to suffering

284
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You don't know the way out from a reason suffering

285
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And then you find something that promises their way out

286
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So you have faith that it might work, if it's applied, obviously

287
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So in the same sense, you recognize you have an illness, you go to a doctor

288
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So you have faith that he can help you, that he can prescribe your medicine, and whatever course of treatment or something

289
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They will then result in that freedom, not from that ailment

290
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So if you do start taking medicine and doing everything rightly, you understood the doctor's instructions properly

291
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And you're not being free from your ailment

292
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, maybe a faith a bit longer, a bit more, keep applying it, but then if it's nothing, there's no results

293
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Well, then you won't have a problem changing it, looking for a different way, because it's not working

294
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You haven't done it out of a sort of emotional attitude, or you, nothing, no, you really, you generally tried, anyhow, it didn't free you

295
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But if it does free you, then that faith disappears, because you don't have to have faith that you could work

296
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Because now you know that he worked, and you are cured

297
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And that's when the suttas, like for Sotapana, his faith in the Buddha Damasanga has been replaced by the confirmed confidence

298
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So he was confirmed, now he can see his health as a direct result of having faith in this application

299
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But again, you need to be honest, because if you're not, you're going to be blaming a doctor

300
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You're going to be blaming the one who gave the instruction

301
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But actually you first need to start with yourself

302
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Because if it's not working, if you don't have patience and you're no self-transparent, you won't see that you're impatient

303
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So then you won't see that it's actually your lack of patience, patience, that's a problem

304
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
As in you need to take the medicine a bit longer, and then you're just going to dismiss a doctor who could have been Buddha himself

305
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So that's why I insist always on self-transparenting, because if you're not, you will be pointing fingers, basically, when there are no results to show flow

306
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So that's why I insist on self-transparenting, that's why I insist on self-transparenting

307
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So the instructions given by the Buddha

308
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What are they? What was his first instructions?

309
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What was his first instructions again?

310
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There's suffering and there's freedom from it

311
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because you have...

312
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
By the way, you're recording, yeah

313
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The Buddha only gives precepts much later on

314
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
In his people during his life, much later on

315
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Well, he defines them specifically later on

316
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The actual virtue that was sort of contained in the eight precepts

317
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Has been praised by him throughout the Suttas and Deganika and Majmika

318
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
He would say that the wise men of the past were virtues

319
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,000
He was taken for granted, basically, that somebody who has already came to that point of practicing the Dhamma has already had their virtue developed

320
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They've been restrained, moral virtues, honest and so on

321
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Where do they get those morality from?

322
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The people who...

323
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In the past?

324
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm understanding the natural principles, as in the universal principles of a human existence

325
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It gets an understanding of principles

326
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Basically, if you understand wise virtue virtues

327
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's already the beginning of wisdom

328
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So you can also arrive at that understanding by taking virtue of faith

329
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The faith we discussed

330
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So you have faith that virtue is necessary

331
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
In the same sense, the doctor tells you

332
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, this medicine will work only if you follow a strict diet

333
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
If you're careless with what you eat, it's going to cancel the effectiveness of a prescription I'm giving you

334
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But obviously some people will not have even that little bit of faith

335
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But if they do investigate, reflect upon themselves in that same transparent manner

336
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Well, you would see basically that virtue is virtues

337
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Because it does not contain any existential discrepancy or contradiction

338
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Which means in order to arrive at it, you are already developing wisdom

339
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Like good things are good because they're basically aligned with the universal principles

340
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
With things that are most fundamental

341
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So like for example, sharing and giving and charity is good

342
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Like why?

343
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Well people say, oh, it makes me feel good

344
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That's all secondary

345
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Existentially, charity is good

346
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Because it goes along the way of you not being owner of the things in the first place

347
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yet everybody starts with a sense of ownership

348
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's completely gratuitous, but everybody owns

349
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Everybody immediately feels they're the owner of their body, their senses

350
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Basically through engagement with the world through the tools, which are your senses, which is your body

351
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You start, you're fully identified with the tools

352
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
With eye, nose, nose, ears and mouth, body and everything else, basically

353
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So you don't know why, but they said giving is good

354
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Well, giving is good because you basically deprive yourself of something

355
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
To give to somebody else which resembles the experience of non-ownership of that

356
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Which has been owned

357
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That which I still regard as mine, I give to somebody else

358
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So you can arrive at it either through doing that and then contemplating it

359
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Or not doing it, but then you need to have this on it

360
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
But it's highly unlikely you're going to arrive at it

361
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Through stinginess and complete lack of any virtue

362
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Based on virtue or charity in kindness

363
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And you can take any, any other thing that's regarded as good and virtues generally

364
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You would see that it would be along the, it would be mirroring

365
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It would be reflecting upon some, some principles of your existence

366
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That you're living right there and then, but you're not aware of

367
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Lying, basically it's another discrepancy

368
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
There is a truth, you choose to override it

369
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You choose to act upon that discrepancy

370
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And then perpetuate it as a non-discrepancy

371
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And that's why it's not wholesome, same stealing

372
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It reinforces the perverted pattern of human existence

373
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
As in, I am the owner of my body and my senses and things that I can gain through

374
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
To the point of then taking that which you perceive through your senses as not yours

375
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
As an extension of the very attitude that you have towards your own senses

376
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Because basically you do become a thief

377
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We might have all started as, as borrowing

378
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We're all just, just basically renting these body and these senses

379
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So to speak, they're given to us for our use

380
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But the moment you start regarding his yours, that which you have rented, you have effectively stole it

381
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Taking from Marlon

382
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Exactly, yeah, the Buddha did say that, is it because people take and use that which doesn't belong to them

383
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Well, they take it as theirs that we just belong to them

384
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
That's why the matter controls them and does what he wants

385
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And that's why they're subject to suffering and the whole death and misery and everything else

386
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And then when the monks are so what are those things?

387
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
He said it's eyes and the objects, ears and sounds, nose and smells

388
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Mouth, sorry, tongue and taste, body and touches

389
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Those are the things basically that don't belong to you

390
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That you're just renting, they're just borrowed jewelry as the Buddha would refer to you

391
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But you start entertaining the notion that you are their owner, they are their own

392
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And it's not like a metaphysical secret that you need to figure out in order to drop it

393
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
To not regard it as yours, no, you just need to dwell on the fact that they're not yours

394
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Just need to keep really, really, really investigating the meaning of not mine

395
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And then applying it to yourself

396
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And they're obviously in the most general terms, that's what the Buddha would describe

397
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Well, if you were the owner of your body, for example, would the body be subjected to sickness, aging and death?

398
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You would it?

399
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
See, many people think that, oh yeah, of course I understand that, I'm subject to all these things

400
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But if you truly understood, if you were to truly understand that, you would be completely free from appropriation

401
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So that's what I mean, if you're self-transparent, then you would see a discrepancy

402
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
On one hand, I'm thinking I understood it

403
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
On another hand, I don't have that which is supposed to be the result of that understanding

404
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
As in freedom from appropriation, freedom from suffering, freedom from greedy version delusion

405
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And if you see that discrepancy, that contradiction, then you'll know exactly where to do the work

406
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Which is, okay, I need to understand this further, and what I think understanding is, it's not sufficient

407
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Or sometimes it's just playing out wrong, but you wouldn't have seen it unless you brought this discrepancy

408
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Like to the fore, I fully understood it

409
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So initially one takes on virtue, given from an external

410
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Well, yeah, exactly set of values, or whatever

411
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But you could see that in every society, there is a degree of it because it would kind of seep down

412
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Into like, you know, collective society awareness that's sort of among the completely unenlightening people

413
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But you'd still get the sense of it

414
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Sharing is good, patience is good, all these things

415
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It is good, but it's also good to understand why these things are good

416
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Because then you can take it even further

417
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Then you can discover virtue by yourself

418
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah, I suppose, well, the Buddha did, so you could say that the Buddha did discover it by himself

419
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But it's highly unlikely, because you would kind of need some point as some external reference point

420
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You got a bit deeper without having

421
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Well, you can only take it so far, basically, you could discover virtue by yourself to a degree

422
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But not fully understand it to the point of becoming a sottabhana

423
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
As in the one who has understood Sila, and thus he is free from Sila Bhattaparamasa, which is virtue and duty

424
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
A factor of virtue and duty is free from

425
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Because that's another thing

426
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
In order to understand virtue, you need to have it

427
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You can't be a non-virtuous person and then understand the nature of virtue

428
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You need to be having it present in you, presently, there is an experience

429
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
As in, you need to be virtuous, basically

430
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But being virtuous in itself, it's nice, but it does not result in wisdom

431
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And if there's no wisdom, there's no liberation

432
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's why, obviously, Sila and virtue, it's not the Dama

433
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But that's why also Dama is impossible to arise without Sila

434
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Because how can you understand, how can you develop understanding of Sila without Sila?

435
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Impossible

436
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But many people don't see their connection, which is why that is the very first feta of Sila Bhattaparamasa

437
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
People think you must be virtuous, and yes, you do, you do have to be virtuous

438
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But then they think, okay, so I'm doing that, and now the practice of Dama and understanding is over here

439
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm doing my meditation technique, I'm reading the suttas, I'm studying Pali, and I'm virtue, so it's all contributing, no

440
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Basically, you have the virtue, you have the morality, you have the restraint

441
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You take it in further, and practice like the sensory strength, even of things that are not necessarily known virtues

442
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
But are not virtuous enough, perhaps

443
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Such as pursuing sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, they're distracting

444
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
They're not necessarily rooted in anger, and breaking of moral precepts or rooted in sensuality

445
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And breaking celibacy precepts and so on

446
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
But they can be rooted in distraction and carelessness, so you stop doing that

447
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And then you understand that very basis, you don't need to go elsewhere

448
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You don't need some other, like, whatever, developing some sort of sappra mundane concentration, no

449
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You already have it in front of you, now you need to start making the effort to cut through that fog of ignorance in regard to it

450
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Don't just take it for granted that it's good, understand it, why it is good

451
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That's why the definition of Sotapan is he's the one who knows good as good, and bad as bad

452
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Putujana is like a virtuous putujana, a good putujana is the one who doesn't know good as good, bad as bad

453
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So if you do want to practice meditation and contemplation, practice it within the basis of your virtuous behavior and sensory strength

454
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You just left right before or after it, within it, as in when this, this is

455
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
When the basis of virtue is present, me trying to understand it is also present

456
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But the point is to understand that they are not found elsewhere or they are not given to you through some sort of divine providence through some sort of

457
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Super concentration you developed and then you have this great revelation

458
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You develop it on the basis that you maintained

459
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So you're maintaining the basis of virtue and then you develop your understanding of it

460
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That's it

461
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And that's why for Sotapan who has understood the nature of virtue, who has understood good as good, bad as bad

462
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
All he needs to do is continue practicing Naikkama Sankapa, as in the video we described it

463
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's thoughts of renunciation, basically, so being virtuous and sensory strength and practicing thoughts of renunciation

464
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And that in itself would then result in other energy because he has understood that

465
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So through doing it, he's developing that very understanding of it

466
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And that's how you would also, as the Buddha will often encourage people to see the danger in the slightest fault

467
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That's how you would start seeing the danger in the slightest fault

468
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Or it's just a small thing, it doesn't matter

469
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The biggest thing or small thing if it but takes in the nature of unwholesome, it's unwholesome

470
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Thus, it's directly against the principle of dama, the universal principle

471
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And that's why it would be enough for somebody to receive instruction as simple as

472
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Avoid anything that's unwholesome and cultivate anything that's wholesome

473
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,000
As they did in the Suttas, the Buddha's foster mother, when she asked for that instruction

474
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And the Buddha said, anything you know that's unwholesome, abandon it and anything you know that's wholesome, cultivate

475
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And then she went for like a seclusion for three months and so on and came back, in other hand

476
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Fully enlightened, fully freed basically, because she fully understood it

477
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And you could see how many people today, oh yeah, of course, this is bad, this is good

478
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But if you were to truly understand that, you'd be this sort of person

479
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So then, if you think you have a knowledge of what's good, what's bad, ask yourself, are you a Suttupan? Are you a stream mentor?

480
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
If the answer is no, then don't take that knowledge for granted, because it's not sufficient

481
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I mean, it might be good and sufficient for mundane terms

482
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But that's, well, exactly, if you might be means you're not free from another

483
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Fatir, which is in that first group, which is Fatir of that, if you don't know, your Suttupanam means you're not Suttupanam

484
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Understanding what Suttupan is makes you one

485
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Understanding what Sillabad Paramasa is, frees you from it

486
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Understanding what a self-view is, frees you from it

487
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So you guys, I might be free from self-view, but I don't know it yet, means you're not

488
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I mentioned yesterday when I was talking to those people

489
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We don't want to mention names

490
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Well, this whole self-reflexive attitude is like, you really want to do it

491
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
In order to gain wisdom, to learn from it, basically

492
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You don't want to be, hey, you're not doing it because you want to justify your actions

493
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I mean, that's what people usually be doing

494
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm not going to say it again

495
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Joe? Andy? Oh, yeah

496
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Crazy little, crazy little, calm down, calm down

497
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You really want to ask yourself, basically, like, say when it comes to practice with them, why are you doing it?

498
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Like, really clarify

499
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Where do you want to arrive with it? What's the goal?

500
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Or in general, in any areas of your life, basically

501
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Just ask them, what do I want to do in my life? What is my purpose?

502
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But don't ask an expect immediate answer or something like that, but ask and then think about it

503
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And then if the answer presents itself, well, then question that answer

504
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Because most people will be going through life, basically

505
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I don't know if there's an English expression, but certainly back in Serbia, like a headless fly

506
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Headless chicken?

507
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Well, you know, like a fly that doesn't have, and it's just flying like mad, left and right, hitting into wind

508
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It's still flying, but it doesn't have the heads, it doesn't see where anymore

509
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And most people would actually be able to help themselves if they just stop for a second and ask yourself

510
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Like, why am I doing this particular thing? What for?

511
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Why do I want it? Why do I want it?

512
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Most people don't even know what they want

513
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So it's just like habitually scratching the edge like an animal, basically

514
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And going through things as they arise

515
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So the attitude would help, even in terms of like an ordinary life, somebody is not interested in greater development of the dama or son

516
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But let alone for somebody who does want to practice dama, it's just completely necessary

517
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You need to develop that self-reflection, that transparency and that kind of scrutiny of your own self

518
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Of your own thoughts, of your own intentions

519
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Because it will force the correct perspective upon you, you can't have it willingly, you can't just willingly adopt the correct perspective

520
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Because any perspective you know of, it's already perspective that's affected by greater version delusion

521
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So just ask yourself, where do I want to be?

522
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And say, in one year time or two years time, provided I lived that long, what's my purpose? What's my goal?

523
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Or you can basically review things that you already got committed to or engaged

524
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Well, why am I doing this? Why am I still doing this? Why did I start doing this? And see where the answers come up?

525
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You want to be successful?

526
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Okay, so what for?

527
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Say I'm doing this job because I want to earn money and be my own boss

528
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Why is that a good thing being your own boss? Why is that something you value?

529
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Well, the answer would be because it's unpleasant to have somebody else telling me what to do

530
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Okay, so why is then the unpleasant experience of having somebody else tell you what to do?

531
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Why is that a problem for you on the personal level?

532
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Why can't you just remain indifferent towards the economy and just do it? Why is it a problem?

533
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Well, it's a problem because it's making me suffer

534
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Ah, so suffering is a problem

535
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Now, you're doing this job 10 hours a day, earning loads of money, trying to start it on a bit

536
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Just because you don't suffer

537
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But is there a guarantee that you won't suffer after all that effort you put in?

538
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
There isn't

539
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And then secondly, that all effort you put in, you might have overcome

540
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
possibility of suffering on account of somebody else telling you what to do

541
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But the millions of other ways of suffering in your life

542
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
means you invested your whole life

543
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
How many years of building something up just to address like 0.1% of possibilities of suffering

544
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Because you haven't freed yourself from the nature of suffering

545
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
You only freed yourself from one particular manifestation of it

546
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Having somebody else less qualified than me telling me what to do and boxing me around

547
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Is that a fair investment? Is that a good investment?

548
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You realize it isn't

549
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So then obviously the inevitable question is what do I do then?

550
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Well, you ask yourself what's more important?

551
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Being completely free from suffering or partially

552
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Now you can choose whatever you want, but then you will choose it responsibly

553
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Because now you know, okay, there is a possibility of being free from suffering altogether

554
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
But I feel it feels a bit daunting for me

555
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So I'm kind of satisfied with sort of halfway

556
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
But that's fine, but then you will take responsibility for it

557
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Which means when the other half of suffering that you haven't freed yourself

558
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Comes your way, you won't be blaming others, you won't be resorting to ill will

559
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Psychologizing your suffering, finding excuses for it

560
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No, you'll accept it as part of the deal that you accept it when you clarify your perspective

561
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And your goals

562
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But if you haven't done that, everything will always be someone else's fault

563
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And you're not going to be responsible for anything you do, yet you're going to be equally bound

564
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Even more probably with suffering and you won't be able to do anything about it

565
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Which means your efforts are completely misdirected, yet that was the goal from the start

566
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And now for somebody who does practice now, I'll just again ask yourself

567
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Well, why am I practicing that? To be free from suffering?

568
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Well, is my current way of practicing, is it contributing?

569
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Well, yeah, I hope it is, but do you know for sure that it is?

570
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Well, it must, well, that's not the right answer, it must be contributing

571
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Because I've been doing it for 20 years

572
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
If it's contributing, means your suffering is lessening

573
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Means possibility to suffer is being lessening, fading out

574
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So you need to be honest and admit because the answer might not be a pleasing one

575
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Especially if you invested 20 years in practice and you still can't tell whether you're anything closer to being free from suffering

576
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But that is the absolute necessary step, for as long as you ignore to address it in such direct, non-compromising manner

577
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You can be practicing for hundreds of years and still remain a protugena

578
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And sometimes, all it would take for you to stop being a protugena is that

579
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Just admit that you're a protugena

580
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That doesn't, because some people might have actually done the right practice, but they don't know it

581
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But they can only find out once they admit that they don't know it

582
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And then if it were right, their efforts, their reflection, then they're like, oh yeah

583
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But because they're too afraid to go that way, they'll never find out

584
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And that's why they won't be a sort of one

585
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And that's why it's their great loss

586
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Basically, all your efforts remain undermined just by lacking their last grain of courage

587
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Just admitting to yourself that you don't know, truly, on that existential level

588
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
You know, after so many years of practice, of so-called practice, of trying to

589
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Suppose like some are trying to get rich and then pretending that they are already rich

590
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Well, pretty much, yeah, again, it's another discrepancy

591
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That's what I mean, like, I don't have to completely 100% discrepancy free

592
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Any discrepancy in the existential is impossible

593
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
That's a definition of another hand

594
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
So if you start recognizing that, you would see exactly, yeah, so I'm practicing

595
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Or say, I'm working to be rich, but I'm not rich

596
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So I can be blaming others

597
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Or I can accept others as a factor in me not being rich and then incorporate it in my efforts

598
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And then upgrade my efforts

599
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But only once I admit that I'm poor

600
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
If you don't admit it, to be everybody else's fault

601
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That's preventing you from getting there or whatever

602
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And you're still going to be doing the same things

603
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Because of which you're not getting where you're going to get

604
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So you won't be questioning your efforts of getting rich, acquiring wealth

605
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Despite your immediate poverty

606
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So is there like a time period that one could say?

607
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You can try a certain...

608
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Well, that's why we'll go back to the very first thing we said about the faith

609
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And then, yeah, so you have to have some faith and you have to give it some time

610
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But yeah, after a while you might even have to cut your losses and just restart

611
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Because you're not doing it for the sake of doing it

612
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You're doing it to be free from suffering

613
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You're doing it for the gold

614
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You're doing it for the fruit, you're doing it to arrive at that degree of liberation

615
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But obviously somewhere down the line for some people

616
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
That kind of got pushed in the background

617
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And now they became too precious, too protective of the efforts they invested in their practice

618
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Despite the lack of result

619
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And then they defend that

620
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They defend that kind of indefensible position, really, it's a contradiction

621
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But they say, well, I might not be a Sothepana, but surely all these efforts do not have been wasted

622
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And they refuse to let go of it

623
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But that means they have to keep doing it

624
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Because if they change their effort, they will be almost like the affirmation

625
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The fact that they've been wasting, that they've been misguided and misdirecting their efforts

626
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So then they have to stick to it just to keep validating it for themselves that they're not wrong

627
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And because of that, they get becoming more and more wrong with each time

628
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because that transparency, if it were there to begin with, gold completely obscured

629
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So basically, question yourself and be honest

630
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Don't fabricate, don't push for answers

631
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Just be honest, where am I in my practice?

632
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Am I complacent?

633
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Do I think I have time, as in how long will I live?

634
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
All these things

635
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And you read the Sothes, that's all the time you're talking about

636
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And you don't do it for some sort of, gaining some sort of emotional kind of uplifting

637
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
No, you're doing it for understanding

638
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
You're doing it to develop clarity, to maintain perspective basically

639
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
That's why you're doing it

640
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And same again, this is like from the point of view of practicing the Dharma and the Buddha staging

641
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But even if you just want to live a wholesome, skillful life

642
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
As a normal layperson, not interested in some renouncing the world that has family and job

643
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Still, it's going to help you

644
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Certainly going to strengthen you

645
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And develop your mind to deal with anything else that comes your way in a lay life

646
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And there are a lot of things coming people's way

647
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Lots of pressure, lots of stress, lots of burden

648
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Initial responses, you just deal by any means necessary

649
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But if you start dealing it rightly through the right perspective, restraint and virtue

650
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It's going to make things more difficult in the beginning

651
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But in the long run, it just creates this resilience that nothing else can match

652
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
That's the definition of wisdom, basically

653
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Obviously, you can have it to different degrees, but

654
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Having perspective on yourself in a situation

655
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Not just being absorbed and pulled by the immediacy of a situation

656
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And it would usually result in being quite reactionary

657
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Situations like this are react like this, just like an animal

658
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And it's also useful before, like if people, the sooner people start thinking like this

659
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But as in thinking in terms of self-refracting and really questioning themselves all the time

660
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
The sooner the better, because you would have committed less in life

661
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
As in starting a family and now you have people there to look after

662
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And so on that you can't just turn your back on

663
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But even then it's not too late

664
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Because there is no end to a human proliferation in the world

665
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
To the proliferation of sensuality in the wrong view and lack of restraint

666
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
There is no end to that

667
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
The only end to that is self-reflection

668
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
They will then prevent you from proliferating carelessly

669
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Through greed and ill will and wrong views and hatred and whatnot

670
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It's true protection, you can't

671
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Taking up responsibility is a true protection for yourself

672
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Going and getting to a group or a certain nationality or identity

673
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That's the opposite

674
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
That's when you have already disowned your responsibility

675
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Then you find that formation in that act by identifying with a greater group

676
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
That just obscures it even further

677
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
The fact that you already covered up your personal responsibility for your personal existence and your personal choices

678
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And then it's just intoxicating, that's like the masses, you know

679
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And even things that you wouldn't have necessarily done on a personal level

680
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
If you were with yourself questioning yourself, you would have, you do it in a group

681
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Because again, it's just got all absorbed in this impersonal day

682
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
As either gate we've been talking about

683
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
The now is just acting as this complete protection and you can do whatever you want

684
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
That's like mob, definition of a mob mentality

685
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
When you know these things are wrong and you wouldn't have done them if you were on your own

686
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Or with somebody else who is not like

687
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
But now it's just mob is intoxicating

688
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And why it's intoxicating because it's just extension

689
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Of complete lack of, well of complete cover-up of your personal responsibility

690
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And then you just do stuff that you were not supposed to for their very sake

691
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It's going to be quite inviting to do it

692
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Here let's smash these windows and break this

693
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Not because they done anything to us or have any game, no

694
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Just because you're not supposed to do it

695
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And if you do it you'll be responsible for it

696
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
But now we're in a mob who cares, they can't get me and then you do it

697
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That's like the ultimate non-restraint

698
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And the ultimate contradiction

699
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Because you can't really, you can only cover up responsibility

700
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Which means through every single act of covering up your personal responsibility

701
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
You reaffirm that personal responsibility because that's the very reason of your actions of covering it up

702
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Hence a sartre will define it as bad faith

703
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Or in authenticity

704
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But you carry it in the heart of everything you do

705
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It's almost like if you want to make your society strong

706
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You have to do your work

707
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Exactly, society will be, the strong society will be a result of personally developed individuals

708
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Developed in a sense of accepting responsibility

709
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And gaining perspective on account of it as in developing wisdom

710
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The result would be a strong society, a resilient society, a just society

711
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Society that has the right perspective on things

712
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Society that's quite aligned with good is good and bad is bad

713
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Because that's what I mean

714
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's that contradiction at the existential level

715
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
That's bad, that's why bad things are bad

716
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So if now you're not self, not not through adopting like

717
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Tama or Christianity or anything just through that self reflection of not tolerating existential contradiction

718
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Not covering up your responsibility for your own choices

719
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Maintaining perspective through constant self questioning

720
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Basically that will already result in you aligning yourself with good action

721
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Even if you don't necessarily know it or have not accepted it as some sort of external set of values

722
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And then if everybody were to start doing that to perspective degree as much as they're capable

723
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It would reflect on the society as a whole

724
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Because there's no society without individuals

725
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Individuals precede society

726
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But obviously it's much more inspiring so to speak

727
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And it certainly requires less work to just identify with impersonal notion of society

728
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And by doing so, enable yourself even further to cover up your own responsibility that you have been avoiding

729
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Because if you were transparent to begin with, you wouldn't have identified yourself

730
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Because you realize what a contradiction that is

731
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
You can't be they

732
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
No matter how much you're absorbed in a greater cause and what not

733
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You cannot step outside of your point of view

734
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Ever, you're completely confined to that perspective

735
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yet you say no, this is not me, this is a greater good, this is a greater service, a greater group, basically

736
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But if you really want to contribute to a group, you do so from the inside as in every single individual

737
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You can't abstract the group as if it's independent of individuals

738
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's basically attempted a shortcut

739
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Hey, let's create a philosophy or a policy or a political system

740
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
They'll be dealing with group as such

741
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Putting individuals second

742
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And there was a definition of communism

743
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Or certainly one of the principles, maybe not a definition

744
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But it's like, okay, well, you theorized the perfection of a group

745
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And then you try, okay, so in order to maintain this perfect image of a group

746
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Will be sort of attacking individuals and dealing with them

747
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And all you're doing is maintaining your own notion, your own perspective of what you think group is

748
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
That's what I mean, you can't step outside of your personal point of view

749
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Ever, and if you do, it's in order to cover it up

750
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Hence the group identity, group politics

751
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And if mob mentality, nationalism, anything, religion

752
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
If it's done for those reasons, and it is, usually

753
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You wouldn't be stepping outside of your group if you're not running away from your own self-responsibility

754
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You wouldn't need it

755
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
On the house of society, we would look if we were going to present each other

756
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Well, as I said, it would probably be much more aligned with principles of good and principles so bad

757
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:34,000
People would have that on an average person would have a good sort of judgment of what's good

758
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
As in, it would have an notion of why good is good, bad is bad

759
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So you could see how modern society, how far it's removed from that

760
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:51,000
People would know and value certain things, but that's far from saying that they understood those things

761
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
That's why the Buddha was talking about the justly, the back in the day

762
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
The righteous king, clearly, has developed knowledge of good, is good, bad is bad

763
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And then he wouldn't be just taking and conquering, be giving back

764
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So basically, people can have a certain quality to their life

765
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Not just exploitation for the sake of personal gain

766
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And because of that, then people are valuing that, and then they start doing the same

767
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Because the king is just dead justly

768
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And they don't blame and gratuitously or try to avoid their own responsibility

769
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Why? Because basically, that's how people already are acting, responsibly and so on

770
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Then you would really stand out

771
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:42,000
That's a decline of society, basically, when sensuality and avoiding of responsibility become a norm

772
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And you realize that, like in schools, for example, when you were growing up, when I was growing up

773
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I mean, we were taught everything and nothing

774
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But as any of us ever been taught in our schools, elementary or higher

775
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Like, you know, the value of patience, the value of sensory strength

776
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
The value of being able to say no to yourself, to be bitter

777
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
If you got any of that, it was circumstantial

778
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
And I think that's quite universal

779
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I don't think, like the whole notion of school back in the days of the ancient Greece

780
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Was to part, sort of, to enable people to go through their life more wisely

781
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
To be able to deal, basically, to create a perspective for them

782
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
They will then create in a better life for them

783
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And you realize today, there's none of that

784
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Perspective? No

785
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You're just being thrown information by the teacher

786
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
If you pedal the information back, you pass it if you don't

787
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Very little understanding of it is actually encouraged

788
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Why? Because people who are teaching haven't understood it themselves

789
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
You're just going through a curriculum

790
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So then you can't be surprised that the value on the level of society

791
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Is just the mirroring personal values

792
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Which is just following your desires, getting what you want

793
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Whenever you want it, however you want it

794
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Not being responsible, blaming others

795
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's kind of a norm nowadays

796
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
But it's impossible, a perfect society

797
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's impossible, yeah

798
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The perfect society would be basically a sangha of arahans

799
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
But there wouldn't be a society anymore

800
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That doesn't mean, of course, that a person should not be aiming at perfection internally

801
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Personally, because aiming at 100% will at least mirror 20% into society of good

802
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That then other people can learn from

803
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
That's not the goal, it's not to perfect society

804
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But basically, think of society as a generated image

805
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And a kind of operating individual

806
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And it's that operation of those individuals, their actions

807
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That's the problem

808
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Generating image of it is just a symptom of a problem

809
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So you could basically see the problems of individuals by looking at the problems of society

810
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You would just be a more general projection of it

811
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
By you trying to deal with the problems of society

812
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
It's like trying to deal with the projection of a problem, not the actual problem

813
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That's why you can use it to learn from it

814
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
To maintain perspective, but the problem is undone on the personal level

815
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Through that responsibility and self-reflection

816
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And questioning and natural virtue, they will come out of it

817
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Then the projection will change, you'll be projecting those things

818
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Not the lack of those things

819
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Yeah, exactly, let's replace this kind of arrangement of society with another arrangement

820
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:57,000
With a different system

821
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
But again, that's missing the point, there's just basically fighting over types of projections

822
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Or trying fighting over ways you should be dealing with projections

823
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
But you're not uprooting the actual problem that is being projected

824
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And again, that attitude itself is a projection of the individual attitude towards your own problems

825
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Like when people suffer, when people experience difficulties

826
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
They don't necessarily look into themselves

827
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Is this a projection of my attitude or my actions?

828
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
No, they want to manage it, they want to manage the problem

829
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
They want to remove the problem, they want to get rid of the problem

830
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
So that's why I mean everything on the level of society is a projection

831
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,000
From the level of individuals, whichever prevails

832
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And that in itself is already a projection of the individual attitude

833
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That they have, that people have in regard to their own problems and suffering

834
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Or I have a problem, well, who caused it? Well, if it's me, okay, well then I'll either apologize or let's pretend it never happened

835
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
All these things are management of the problem that has already arisen

836
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yeah, you can do that, but that's not uprooting the problem, don't confuse the two

837
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Approaching of the problem is then reflecting further and saying, okay, but will I in the future then cause the same issue for myself through my careless actions, for example?

838
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Or will I be able to prevent it? How can I prevent it?

839
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And that's the truth, the official learning from your own mistakes, like trial and error

840
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Well, you want to look not just to deal with this particular issue, there has arisen

841
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But to basically extrapolate the principle that you can discern, that can then help you not make the same mistake in the future

842
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And if that's your attitude towards your own personal existence and actions and responsibility and choices and so on

843
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And that's the attitude of other people as well, that will be reflected in society

844
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Or at least not the largest society but your family

845
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Well, of course, yeah, certainly, yeah, yeah, it's individual, then the family, then the smaller group, whatever, then obviously

846
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But it all trickles down, like a stream on a mountain top that's filling down

847
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Lower streams, they're filling down lower rivers, they're filling down lower lakes and other rivers, then eventually filling down the seas and so on

848
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:44,000
If you dry it up at the top, or if you remove the pollution from it at the top, eventually even the sea will cease to be polluted

849
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:55,000
But if you're just trying to deal with the level of the sea without addressing the source of the pollution, well, you're fighting a losing battle
