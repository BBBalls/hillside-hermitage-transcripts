00:00.000 --> 00:19.480
So, as I was saying before, in terms of the sense of self, to what you are trying to do

00:19.480 --> 00:29.360
it is invariably, but once you become established in terms of mindfulness or the experience as

00:29.360 --> 00:36.240
a whole, as you said, which sort of reveals this sense of self has kind of separated from it.

00:36.240 --> 00:44.240
If you get established in terms of practice knowing that you are not supposed to, that it's actually

00:44.240 --> 00:49.480
impossible to bring that background sense of self, that ambiguous sense of self, to bring

00:49.480 --> 00:52.360
it forward, to bring it front of you to see, because then something else will be the

00:52.360 --> 00:53.360
very unfair.

00:53.360 --> 00:58.680
So, when you kind of give up these futile attempts, based on these wrong habits of expecting

00:58.680 --> 01:03.640
to get it in front of you, expect it to last bit, then that sense of self can become

01:03.640 --> 01:07.200
the option for mindfulness itself.

01:07.200 --> 01:13.000
If you're sensing incorrectly that background sense of self, that sense of I am, because

01:13.000 --> 01:18.360
it is in a way more general than everything else, it's just that once you have discerned

01:18.360 --> 01:24.040
the principle that it's actually fully determined by whatever you have put in front of you in

01:24.040 --> 01:29.800
that experience as a whole, the fully depends upon it, that it's inconceivable without

01:29.800 --> 01:32.720
same like the dependence of number of being out of the number of being out of the number

01:32.720 --> 01:33.720
of being.

01:33.720 --> 01:38.320
Then, just enough to have the sense of self, you don't need to then, in the beginning

01:38.320 --> 01:43.240
you have to, but then you don't need to look for these determinations, even along the

01:43.240 --> 01:44.240
right lines.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.240
Why?

01:45.240 --> 01:50.080
Because then, by then, it becomes apparent that whatever has a reason, that's why it's

01:50.080 --> 01:54.560
apparent, so then you start seeing impermanence in simple things, in simple fact that things

01:54.560 --> 01:55.560
have manifest.

01:55.560 --> 02:01.920
No matter how big is how much or background, how much, it's impossible to kind of grasp

02:01.920 --> 02:05.560
them, hold them, close and inspect them.

02:05.560 --> 02:11.720
The fact that it's appeared in any shape of form, distant, big is removed, whatever, it's

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
apparent.

02:12.720 --> 02:23.520
Because it has the beginning, by necessity, implies the end or other ending is the

02:23.520 --> 02:24.520
end.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.520
What is the meaning of the beginning?

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
What does it mean?

02:26.520 --> 02:27.520
That it wasn't.

02:27.520 --> 02:35.520
One of its meaning could be, if I say, well, what does it reveal basically?

02:35.520 --> 02:36.520
What does it reveal?

02:36.520 --> 02:37.520
Sure, that's me.

02:37.520 --> 02:46.720
If it wasn't before, because if it wasn't before, it cannot be an internal self, because

02:46.720 --> 02:49.720
if it weren't, then the self wouldn't have been there all the time.

02:49.720 --> 02:54.360
The less it feels, the internal self feels.

02:54.360 --> 03:01.360
You can't, you know, so back, you can't remember, kind of here, but that whole, that whole

03:01.360 --> 03:03.720
of a large thing is a concept.

03:03.720 --> 03:07.080
That can't be done in this presence, and that's what I told you, that if you were to

03:07.080 --> 03:14.480
not, you're not supposed to give the rid of that sense of I am, you're just supposed

03:14.480 --> 03:23.720
to undermine its gratuitous notion of permanence, of being constant.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.920
So you have experience as a whole, and then you have that background sense of self, the

03:26.920 --> 03:33.680
people can mystify, or, well, whatever, they're not mystically called it observer, or

03:33.680 --> 03:38.160
pure awareness, pristine awareness, or whatever new age it turns you might come up with,

03:38.160 --> 03:42.200
the fact is there is that thing, there is a background, that you cannot have in the

03:42.200 --> 03:43.200
fund.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.680
There is the observer of the observed, and that's not the problem.

03:47.680 --> 03:53.960
The problem is that you still assume, imply the permanence associated with that observer,

03:53.960 --> 03:59.560
no matter how far you mystify it, what words you use, the fact that you regard it, he has

03:59.560 --> 04:05.600
a notion of mind to it, or real, or more control, more of a center of experience.

04:05.600 --> 04:10.120
So you're not interfering with that, whatever you want to call it, but you want to interfere

04:10.120 --> 04:14.320
with it, is that the truth is notion of permanence associated with it, and how interfered

04:14.320 --> 04:20.960
with it, the only way you can do it is indirectly by seeing it inseparable from that which is permanent,

04:20.960 --> 04:25.960
sorry, which is impermanent, which is fully understood as something that will have to

04:25.960 --> 04:32.960
cease, when you then, through the, like, literally, fabrication through your efforts, you kind

04:32.960 --> 04:40.200
of establish, you force upon the dependence of that observer, inverted commas, quote unquote

04:40.200 --> 04:48.040
observer, if you just, like, force that the dependence upon that which is observed, then

04:48.040 --> 04:56.640
the dependence will become revealed, why? Because there is genuine dependence of the two,

04:56.640 --> 05:03.320
and through emulating it, first, simply based on the external advice, through emulating

05:03.320 --> 05:08.600
the dependence, then it will become apparent eventually, why? Because it becomes apparent

05:08.600 --> 05:15.600
only after a sufficient number of times, after it's been repeated, a number of times,

05:15.600 --> 05:21.200
basically, as long as it takes, something that takes more, something that takes less.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.880
So once you've been repeating this principle that your doctrine of faith externally, as

05:24.880 --> 05:30.080
a true principle whereby observer is determined by that which is being observed, it's inseparable

05:30.080 --> 05:35.960
from it, it cannot be conceived apart from it. If you keep emulating that, because there

05:35.960 --> 05:42.640
is the actual nature of things, then it will become apparent. So it's like, it's complete,

05:42.640 --> 05:46.640
it's complete darkness in the beginning, and somebody just tells you to keep repeating

05:46.640 --> 05:51.640
these steps, they will eventually bring the light, but initially, you don't know.

05:51.640 --> 06:00.320
What's the point of that, like, if you see certain things, external things are not in your

06:00.320 --> 06:09.000
control, like, you get your body, whatever, the weather, so if you, or the bus game, time

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
or people liking you, your reputation is only in control, then if you truly see that

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
your reputation is only in control, if you find out that people are speaking bad about

06:21.000 --> 06:30.000
you, then you're not necessarily going to get upset, because you throw any contemplative

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
bit out of my control, and they could say good things, they could say bad things, but

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
that's when they say bad things, they're not referring to the mind as withdrawn from

06:39.000 --> 06:48.000
that domain. So when you realize that you're all, they're very sense of self,

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
there's not any other control, your mind is withdrawn from that.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
But what about the view that they've been able to, your attitude towards things, like

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
the game, your attitude towards things, which is dependent on things being there, other

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
things, I mean?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Would you go beyond that view as well?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Actually, beyond your control.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
The other hand.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Again, the noble evil path, in the case of another hand,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
they added another, which is basically beyond...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
What was the...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
He was going beyond the views.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Car intention right after that, it goes on, on, on, on.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And then, basically, it's beyond.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
How did he go that sort of the last two?

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
What was it?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
It's the ten factors, ten.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, a capture, for example, basically.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
The noble path becomes ten.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Yes, it was basically...

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, it's clearly indicated, okay, the...

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
And Arya Sava, of any form,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
still has a degree of review.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
And for another hand, he fully overcomes even the views as well.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
So good beyond the views.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And that's what our entrepreneurs do.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
So that's exactly it.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Yet, the view is, like, you can see very much as a law,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
as an eternal law, as an impersonal law,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
as a law that doesn't subject to anything, kind of,

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
from the physical law.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
But actually, it's inseparable from it.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
In its phenomenological nature,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
it would not be there if things had not arisen

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
beforehand on a counter, which you have developed a view.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
So now, the view might seem independent of it.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
But the fact is, if the matter in its entirety disappears,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
you can remain old in the view.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Given the right view.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Right, the wrong view.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
So then you go beyond the view.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
When you see fully abandoning that subtle depends on the view.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
The view?

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Like, a person can't go beyond...

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
You can't see that you're choosing.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, no, going beyond the view doesn't mean finding some area

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
beyond the view, which you then inhabit.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
However, going beyond the view means abandoning the view.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Abandoning depends on the view.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
In the same sense, you said...

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
For the view?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
If you true...

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Well, yeah.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But then it's easy to be the view.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Yeah, yeah.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
The direction is still there, but it's easy to be the view.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
The view is, for as long as you are taking it up.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
So it's the same thing as you just said.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
If you contemplate that praise is out of your control,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
and you truly abandon it, then the blame will not affect you.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
If you contemplate the view...

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Views are fully a reason based on their reason things before,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
and then you fully abandon that as well.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
So it doesn't mean they never appear.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
It just means they'll never be yours.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
It means they'll never be manifested as views.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Because using the word view implies my point of view,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
my direction, my take on things, or whatever.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
How subtle it may be, the point is to go beyond it,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
which means the mind is not established on it either.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
What?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Third.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
In any way.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
So going beyond the view does not mean going into the realm of transcendental existence.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
It means mind letting go of the view as well.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Depending.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
But truly letting go of the view, not all letting go of the views now.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Like fully developing this principle of simultaneous dependence that I've been talking about,

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
to a full extent whereby even the subtlety of views is announced,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
is announced as yours.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
As as as as as as like a center of mind, everything is just completely disowned.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And that comes with that.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So it's not about figuring out what's beyond the view.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
It's not about feeling what's behind this observer or where he comes from,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
what he is or what can I paint it to.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
It's all about seeing a no matter what it is as a background,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
it will depend on the foreground.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Or rather, it depends on the foreground, right there, right now.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
It depends not in a linear sense whereby one led to the number two,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
but more like in the simultaneous sense where one detends is one.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So the presence of it is inseparable from this.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
So if you hold, and as I said, it can be as general as mind and body.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
You don't have to necessarily pursue any more particular definitions.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
Mind and body, physical and mental, can call it that.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
As I said, mental, you have to make this connection that's descended

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
and then keep repeating them until they become apparent whereby you see that mind.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
No matter how independent it might seem, our mind might feel,

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
it's inseparable from the presence of the physical body, like inconceivable.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Well, you can imagine physical body dying by the mind continuing.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
But that's like not falling from the final.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
It means that's not mindful thinking.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
If you're mindful, you will see whenever there is a thought of you

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
as a whatever personality or mind or whatever,

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
there are implied images of your body or your matter or something.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
Or something exactly like a light, like a space, like an eye.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Anything, and you realize that is matter.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
That stands for what matter is.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
It does. I cannot even conceive.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Anything mental without this matter already being there,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
given before and simultaneously.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
Any other way around as well, you realize that absolutely no matter how far out

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
into the matter you go, you realize this matter is inconceivable

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
if I'm not determining it, even mutually recognizing it.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah, recognizing it, and designation, recognition, everything,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
that's all mental. That's all pertains to the mind.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
So, you realize, well, no matter, like I can truly examine

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
the forms of all I'm examining is, the perception of that matter

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
can never be directly accessed in your experience.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Your body cannot be accessed directly in your experience.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
So, it's always in regard to the body.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
Yet, it's that because of which your mind is there in the first place.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
I mean, if you look at, I think it's the same one.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
If you look at choosing, because choosing is there.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
If you don't get further than that.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
You look at choosing, and then you couldn't choose anything

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
if there wasn't these choices there.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Exactly.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
So, even though you've got power, and you've got the power to choose

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
between good and bad, I wouldn't.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Both are already there before, and the choice is given before,

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
and which means the power of choice is fully determined

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
upon the things that are given before.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
To free will is the same one I'm saying.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
Like, it's free will, but there is a freedom to choose this or that.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
But it's fully within the given parameters of choice,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
which means it's fully imprisoned.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
It's not free free, because you can't create anything free.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
You can only shift from left to right or whatever within

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
what that which is already given.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
So, you cannot even conceive stepping outside of it.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Because stepping outside of it, usually people assume

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
it's either frame from choice, thus I don't engage in it,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
and there was another choice.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Are you afraid from choosing is something that you chose?

14:22.000 --> 14:28.000
Or, then, why do you choose something over another?

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Well, I see that's your assumption that they would want

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
to explain the choice, which means you want to take the control over the choice,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
which means if you want to put a sentence or choice,

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
which means it's taken as yourself, comes from the assumption of the self.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
Why do you choose something over the other?

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
Well, I mean, I would, for what have I been like,

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
there's tenancies in one, there's only tenancies.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, in a month.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
So, he said, couldn't you say there was a reason for it?

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Well, the thing is, see, the choice works in the same way,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
like they were we spoke when I referred to it similarly

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
from the soldiers of, you know, the rain falls on the top of the mountain,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
they're in the springs from the top of the mountain,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
but then as they come down, they're getting bigger and bigger

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
because they collect more and more water,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
then you have the pools, mountain pools filled with water.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
And they start overflowing, they fill out the lower pools and lower,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
and then you have the ocean, but all comes from the same water.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
So, what you're asking now is only in the level of ocean.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
It's all within the level of full development and then what did I choose?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
But basically, all of your choices that you're making

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
are kind of, well, they're all form of directions.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
Choice is a direction to choose, which means every particular direction

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
has been determined by more general directions.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
So, you can say, well, why did I choose right here?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Why did I choose this thing right here right now?

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
And they were always going to be an element of kind of spontaneity.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
To a degree, sometimes more, sometimes less,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
depending on how much people, but spontaneity is a very,

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
a very phenomenon, a circumstance, a chance.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
It's a phenomenon that you can then choose to be the reason for your choice.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
But more importantly than that, why you choose particular things

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
is because of the stuff you chose in the past.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
So, now people, for example, like, you know,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
there are many cases that I met,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
where people who get inspired by the situation want to practice

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
with the situation, but they've been out in the low of,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
for quite some time, accumulated things, accumulated people,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
accumulated family and children.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
And now, they can't just choose to leave it all behind.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It's too much.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
So, then they say, well, obviously, it's not my fault

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
that I can't become a monk.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Well, actually, it is.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
If you want to see it as a fault, it is a fault.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Why?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Because of the 30 years beforehand,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
you've been choosing all the things they've been taking the away elsewhere.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
And you did not consider at the time when you wanted to find a wife

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
and have children that, who knows, in about 10 years,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I might despise it all.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
In 15 years, I might want to leave and become a monk.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
You didn't think that.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
You just thought what your sense desire was dictating it.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
So often, people choose a determined by senses.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Because senses are independent of five animals,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
simply, they just drag you left and right,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
and then you think you are choosing left or right

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
in terms of the beautiful sides, because you already given in

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
to the pressure of beautiful sides.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Beautiful touches, agreeable tasteness.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
So, that's most often the why people choose.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
Because they just take for granted the criteria of sense pleasure.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
If you start contemplating that,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
the danger in sense, you just stop choosing a sense pleasure.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
When you stop choosing a sense pleasure, those pools will dry up.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Bit by bit, and then they won't be filled anymore.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
So, there is the choice.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
So, if you want to find out why did I choose right this right now?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Why did I choose that?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Well, start looking back.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
What did you choose before and before?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
And I mean more general.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I didn't mean in the linear sequence,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
what I've chosen five minutes ago and 15 minutes ago.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
I mean, what did I choose to do in my life that led me to this point?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
So, if you say, why did I choose to go and live on top of a mountain now,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
when I could have gone to a monk?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Well, because at first I chose to become a monk.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
10-11 years ago.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Then I've chosen to come to Sri Lanka.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Then I've chosen to find a more secluded place.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
Then I said, and now I have this particular choice that results out of that.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
So, in that sense, no matter how spontaneous the choice is,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
you are responsible for it because of the previous choices you made,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
because of the previous choices you made,

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
because of the previous choices you made.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
So, all of the choices you made,

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
the options, so to speak, were given to you before and initially?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
You do choose the direction and within that direction,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
you choose other directions and other directions.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Something circumstance, accident, things happen,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
but that's all part of the human realm.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
And that just shows you that no matter how evolution,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
how evolutional your choices are,

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
they're always going to remain, well, out of your control.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Because no matter what you chose, what you built,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
what direction you took,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
it cannot be taken away in one stroke of bad luck.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
But it's not like it's in someone else's control.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
No.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Or something else's control.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Well, that's when you project your sense of self,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
that you can't let go of externalism

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
and then you're assuming a goal.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
A goal that meant, and then you pray,

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
and then you become super-

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
or rather then you tap into the kind of natural incline superstitiousness of people,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
which is basically praying to something external,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
because you recognize that.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
You recognize the no matter how much effort you put,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
how far you go, how carefully you choose,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
everything can be taken away the next second from you,

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
and destroyed.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
So what you do, because you don't know

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
that you're supposed to let go of your own sense of self.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
You don't see that as the way out.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
You can't even conceive yourself, not being yours.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
So then you just end up projecting that sense of externalism.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
So you end up worshipping trees,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
caves, stones, deities, whatever.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Externally, through that sense of self,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
as if exactly, you realize this is not in my control,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
but you, by default, assume that it's in someone else's control,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
or something else's control, which is still taking itself.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Making assumptions.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah, so you become superstitious.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
If you don't believe it anywhere, you become like magical.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
You think, oh, if I step on my left foot first,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
it's going to be a bad luck.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
It's just completely random.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
But it's still projected in the same external principle.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
But if I look back to why,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
if I read off myself why I want you in this,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and I look back in general,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
or ever say the other day, it was like,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
what do you choose?

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
You choose what is pleasant.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
You choose what you think is pleasant.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Yeah, they would come down to the core, basically.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
You choose based on how you feel.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
What are you saying?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Most often.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
You're craving for pleasure.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
The delight in pleasure is the reason.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, for doing many of the things you think.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah, it's not the reason for choice,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
because choice is one of the other reasons.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Like, not the reason.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah, it's not the reason.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It's not its origin.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
It's just the reason why you choose certain choices.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
But the nature of choice remains regardless of the craving.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Choice is one of the arguments.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
The intentions, Chetan, that's already choice.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Everything is intentional.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Everything is directional in that sense.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
So you just want the attention,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
what intention you attend.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
So then the choice becomes down to attending to things.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
And that's why you would have often say,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
he carefully attends.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Not careless, because if you carelessly attend,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
then you already start feeling a certain direction.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.000
So by the time the choices are kind of crystallized as options,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
you're actually fully responsible

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
because you've been dwelling on those things in your mind.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
So if one somebody carelessly attends to the sign of beauty

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
and ends up lasting after it,

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
he can't be surprised that then his choice

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
is about pursuing the central pleasure

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
or, okay, saying no to it,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
but there's nothing in between.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
He can't say anything in between,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
because it's all about centrality,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
because his mind has been dwelling.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And obviously, then he'll choose to pursue it.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
He's not strong enough to say no.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
The choice of no is present in everything.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
And that's when you realize that you can...

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
You yourself can undermine everything as well.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
But this thing, that knowledge has to be presented to you.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
You need to know before and...

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Yes, you can't.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Or there's a different way.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Oh, there's no there was a choice there.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
So your intentions...

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
Your intentions become fueled by the simple attention

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
of what you attend more,

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
what you attend at the expense of what...

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And then those intentions then,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
determined further down the line,

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
cause the forms of choices you made in your life.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
But if you were to know that,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
if you just then...

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
No matter what choices you made,

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
if it's like...

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Ah, the example I gave,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
the man who wants to leave it all behind

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
but feels responsible for his family and he can't give it in.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
If he still doesn't give it to bad fate

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
and if he still doesn't obscure the sense of guilt

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
that he himself wrote himself into that position,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
if he starts to attend constantly

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
on the freedom from suffering,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
on the Buddhist teaching of whatever,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
soon and well,

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
eventually, maybe not soon,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
but eventually he will build enough resolve

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
to leave it all behind.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
He just might take longer than somebody who doesn't

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
and the family and kids and everything else.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
But they don't attempt it.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
No, they just look at it.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
I want to do it right now,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
but I can't do it because of my family

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
and then they dishonor responsibility for it

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
as if it wasn't them who built that family

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
and then they don't think about it anymore.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And then they just cement,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
cement it, like cement over it,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
as if it's done.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
It's all that I can't possibly do it

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
because of this,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
and I'm not responsible for any of it,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
thus I'll just have to do what I can.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
But what I got,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
was to see that the choice to leave it all behind

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
or freedom from the choice to be freedom suffering.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
The guy who's just living his life with it,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
having a family with it.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
That choice appears.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
He doesn't, he doesn't just,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
he doesn't know even to mention it.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
He just kind of is there.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
No, I'm talking about why would he choose that

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
or why he wouldn't choose that,

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
why he wouldn't be able to choose

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
which is right to us originally.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
It's because he's either too weak in regard to it,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
to such choice,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
too weak to say that, too weak to stir himself up,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I, too weak to accept the pain,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
they would come with it initially,

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
too weak to see through the immediate pleasure that appears

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
as not fully gratifying,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
because it's pleasant to be in the safety of your home

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
and family,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
but in a long run, it's more dangerous.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
But he's too weak to see any of that,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
because he's not attending to it on a daily basis.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Yet, if he was to not give in

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
to that kind of cover-up of his own guilt

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
for his own choices,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
cover-up of his own responsibility for his own choices,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
he would be able to keep dwelling on it,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
to attend to it.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And if he does attend sufficiently,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
there won't be no amount of children

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
of family to keep you in their life

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
if you recognize the true danger of human existence,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
the peril of it.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I mean, you know, the sisters,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
there were people who just saw through it

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
who were like about to become kings, the queens,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
with everything laid out for them,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
like what everybody would just wish for.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Yet, they were like disgusted with the whole thing

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
and left it the next moment.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Now, he said, well, can't I leave it the next moment?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Well, whenever you leave it,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
it's going to be left the next moment,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
because that's how leaving works.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Why you can't reach to the next moment

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
when you leave things is because

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
you haven't been building it up,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
and you build it up through simply attending to things.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
So, you're only someone I seek at the proper attention,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
and it's like the root of everything.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
That's what you're saying.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
And you can't know about those things you need to be attending to,

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
without...

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Oh, yeah.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Without good friends.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
So, without somebody telling you what you need to attend to.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
So, that's what it's like.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
That they're good friends.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
It's not in your control.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Like, they might be out there, but you know.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Oh, yeah.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
You don't have anything like that.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Well, that's what I said.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Like, I can't choose.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
There is a degree of just complete like circumstance.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
But then at the same time,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
as I said, circumstances are so, yeah.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
You might have been lucky to come across the Buddhist teaching.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
But luck has nothing to do with you choosing to practice or not,

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
with you drilling and year after year-making efforts

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
of like undoing the ignorant habits of your mind.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
There is absolutely no room for luck there.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
And that's why, yeah.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Sometimes in the soon,

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
there's the monks who have developed the Sahgit Pavels to see beyond.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
They would say, oh, yeah.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
I met that person,

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
because in the previous life,

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
we were close,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
and then we were bound to kind of revolve around each other,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
no matter where we're reborn and so on.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
But all that is irrelevant.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
How it came to be,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
it's irrelevant.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Why? Because you're responsible for what you do and account of it.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
You're responsible for what you choose.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
And the thing is, see, many people,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
even back in the Buddha,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
they came across the Buddha,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
but not all of them seen His wisdom

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
and not like not even half of them choose to follow it.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
So people can come across the purists of the Dharma instructions

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
and not even recognizing as such.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Why? Because they don't have that proper attention.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
So the two factors for the right view,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
proper attention,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
and afterance of another.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
And proper attention, basically,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
it's not a momentary,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
I can't even write with my second note.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Proper attention is an attitude

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
of looking at things rightly,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
not obscuring the things.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
So a responsible authentic attitude

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
will be an attitude of proper attention.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Obviously, if nothing is instructed to you,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
to properly attend,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
that proper attention in itself

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
can only do out of the suffering.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
But with the right attitude, the proper attitude,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
the attitude of proper attention,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
and the right instruction,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
you will know what to look for,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
you will know what to keep attending.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Because as we spoke before,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
the environment can't happen by luck

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
because attending to something rightly

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
has to be done way more than once,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
has to be done countless numbers of times

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
until the handle of ignorance,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
of the acts of ignorance,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
wears, thin, thinner, thinner, thinner.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
But if you pick up the acts once,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
the wouldn't handle,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
there's absolutely no difference.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
And if you don't know,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
that you're supposed to keep doing it on and on,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
and on, and on, and on, and on,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
for seven days,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
seven months, seven years,

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
who knows?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Seven lifetimes.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
If you don't know that,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
there is nothing to indicate to you

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
that you should pick that acts again.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Because you can pick it once,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
twice, five times,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
by accident,

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
by chance, by your own reasoning.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
But there won't be any apparent proof

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
or a verification

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
that this is the way out of suffering,

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
not anytime soon.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
So unless somebody tells you

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
that there is a way out,

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
and you keep sticking to it,

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
you won't do it.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
You just, like throwing a coin.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
You can throw a coin,

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
and you can get,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
head, five times, ten times,

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
but it's simply impossible,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
that thousand times,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
thousand throws,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
will always yield the same result,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
impossible.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
And that's exactly it.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
During these thousand times,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
without knowing that you're supposed to,

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
it's not about head and tail,

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
it's about actually throwing the coin,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
that's what I'm doing.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And let somebody tells you that,

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
you won't know,

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
because you won't be apparent.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That's why the, like you know,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
someone, somebody who did,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
and liked himself,

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
with his own efforts,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
without any external advice,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
is like the greatest.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
And should that simple trial and error,

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
that took him like lifetimes to develop?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
So unless somebody tells you what you're doing now,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
keep doing it,

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
maybe find you on it,

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
or point out more,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
or whatever,

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
inspiring similar ways to develop the same principle,

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
unless you read it somewhere,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
unless you're faith in what you read,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
it's simply impossible,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
that you repeated exactly the same way,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
for thousands of times,

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
because there is no result to it.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
No, no, no result to it.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
You can't see the example where you're clean.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
You just can't see it.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Good as a thing.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
There might be someone who might point out,

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
what can I have that will keep,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
that will help me make the right,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
the right choice,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
all the time.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
What can I have?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
What is necessary for making the right choice all the time?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Yeah.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
That's basically impossible.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You can know that you make the right choice,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
only after you have repeated it,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
like only after you discovered your handle,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
one thing, you'll know,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I worry thin.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
And that's exactly it.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
People think it's like throwing the coin,

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
and then you throw it,

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
and you go to the right,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
no.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
It doesn't matter where it's head or tail.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
What matters is thousands,

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
and thousands,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
and thousands of times of flicking,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
and flicking it,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
and flicking it.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
And just see it, see it, see it.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
And then you realize,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
it wasn't about the head or tail,

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
it was about wearing the dang coin down.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And wearing what the coin is irrelevant

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
to the result that you get when you throw the coin,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
it's your expectation that leads you to results.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
But the actual efforts,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
of throwing it regardless of result,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
is what worry down.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
So, I'm going to,

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
on another level,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
another level of difference.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Well, just on a similar level,

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
the photo will just one more thing,

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
and unless you know what you're supposed to do,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
throw an afternoon off another,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
be reading with suit as a study,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
or whatever else,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
whatever way you might have arrived at it,

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
it's impossible that you would have been repeating

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
the same efforts

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
in the same way for a long time.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It's just impossible.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Because there is no guidance

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
on what those efforts are.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
So, if you're using your own judgment,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
and the old judgment is influenced

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
by the inevitable expectation of pleasure

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
in your form of peace or whatever,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
but basically you would be acting on your pleasure,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
which means there will be some cravings,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
which means unless somebody does externally,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
and then you have faith

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
into that more than what your own,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
like initial inclinations,

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
you won't undo that.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Because then you need to keep repeating that,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
which is contrary to your own existence,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
going against the grain.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
So, if somebody defines the grain,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
so you can go against,

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
you won't be able to go,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
because everything you do is with your grain.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
So, you need that external input

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
in which your have faith

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
to keep sticking to it.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
But without that,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
without that external instruction,

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
it's impossible that you would be repeating the same effort,

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
the same quality of effort,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
sufficient amount of time.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
So, a person can attend to the right view,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
accidentally,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
and then they can do it again,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
but if they never heard about the right view,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
if they never heard what the right view is,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
if they never heard what the right view is,

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
how to the right view,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
they never heard what to look for in the right view,

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
they never recognized what they just done was the right view,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
which means it's unthinkable

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
that they repeat the same experience,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
thousands and thousands and thousands of times,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
it's simply unthinkable.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Why? Because they don't recognize

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
that experience for what it is,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
they don't want to know what to look for or not and not.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
So, they might accidentally,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
that's what it's impossible to become

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
even a sort of owner by sheer accident,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
or I heard it once.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
When people hear something once,

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
like in the suitors,

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
they have the study once,

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
because their minds were already developed

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
through these right habits beforehand.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
So, the same repetition has been already developed,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
and now they go like the last kind of drift

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
that sort of covered it all right there.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
But except that,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
you can't, you know,

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
come down, you know,

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
come down to the efforts.

34:11.000 --> 34:24.000
So, if someone is riddled with lust,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
at one point, at one time,

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
riddled with anger,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
there was no how-can-ite,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
simply not choose that direction,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
to go in that direction.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
If I see that, I don't,

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
there's a choice.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
I can either continue with this lustful mode,

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
or not,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
what starts me funny.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
What makes me choose not to follow that lustful direction?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Well,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
and what makes me choose to go further,

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
that's what it is.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
See, if it comes to the point of being riddled

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
by anger,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
by lust or by anger,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
well, what you need to recognize

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
is that you kind of let yourself get into that state.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
And once you're in that state,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
there is nothing else that you can do,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
except endure.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
And that is a form of choosing no.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
So that's why, you know,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
the strength of mind to just withstand

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
no is necessary.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
But that does not necessarily bring the,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
it's necessary when things kind of

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
come up of such nature

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
that you just have to endure then.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
But basically,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
that's only like one way of dealing with it

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
at a time,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
because fundamentally you want to find a state

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
where those things don't bother you at all,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and there is no form of indulence.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
And that comes with wisdom.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
And that wisdom comes with foreseeing these things.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
So you ended up in a state of rack,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
racked by anger or by lust,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
because, you know,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
for days and weeks before,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
you didn't pay any attention to it.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Or you paid attention to it wrongly.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Or you were attending,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
or you were attending certain central notions,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
or certain irritable notions,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
then, you know,

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
paid a few circumstances

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
with something that happened

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
with a bad mood,

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
with this,

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
with a lack of sleep,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
now results in this full on anger.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Oh,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
but what do I do right here right now?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Well, what you do right here,

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
and I recognize,

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
right here right now,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
was influenced by, you know,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
quite some time before,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
or if you're careless attending,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
so then you become even more concerned

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
about attending things wrongly later on.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
So you actually learn from it,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
but at the time in itself,

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
just clench your teeth,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
press the tongue against the ruffa and endure it.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
As the Buddha said,

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
sometimes just you need to,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
like a stronger man,

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
paint down the weak man,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
who kind of went mad.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
But you have a reflexive contemplation.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Of course, of course.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
This is my response.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Sometimes, well,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
you just have to endure it.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Once you endure it,

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
once you haven't given in,

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
you recognize,

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
yeah, this is how it came about.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
It was through my case as attending,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
so,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
so then you become more concerned

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
about attending things carefully,

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
which means,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
such extreme examples

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
where you just have to purely endure,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
will be a rising less and less.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Why?

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Because you're not, you're going away from it.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
In the beginning, every thought

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
of centrality or anger

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
is the wrecking,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
centrality or wrecking anger.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Because the mind is just left the right,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
everywhere,

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
and nowhere.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Once you start developing that mind,

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
once you start recognizing

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
this influence of the, you know,

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
the mountain streams

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
in filling down the oceans,

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
then you start,

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
you'd stop all the time

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
to enter the oceans,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
you just go and deal with the mountain streams,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
because you know

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
eventually these oceans will dry up.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
So, in the same sense,

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
but carefully attending to things,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
beforehand,

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
such extreme experiences

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
won't be waiting for you down the line.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
But,

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
before you've done that.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Before you've done that,

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
you do need to endure

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
a fair bit of it.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Yeah.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
But then you...

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Depending how quickly you do it,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
how quickly you extract this from it.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Do you have that contemplation?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Yes, reflective.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
But inevitably,

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
to some extent,

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
it will come down to endurance,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
endurance every now and then.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
And there is a very

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
aspect of practice in endurance,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
because that's the thing.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Endurance?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
No matter what circumstances

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
have brought the options

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
for your choice in front of you,

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
it will be you choosing to...

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Well, you're intentionally

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
intending some aspects of it,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
even at the time.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
So, obviously,

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
it can be very painful

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
to attend to the opposite.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I need to say no.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
But it's only painful

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
because your mind has been going

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
in the direction of sensuality

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
for such a long time.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
You haven't been extracted

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
from it.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
You haven't been attending properly.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
So, now, when you have to say no,

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
it's just so hard,

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
because the whole other one,

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
she's already going in.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It's so painful to stop it.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Yet, you can always do it.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
And that's...

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
That makes endurance easier.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
You can always say no.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Literally.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Literally, if you have wisdom.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Like you can...

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
If you have strength,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
and wisdom in regard to...

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Like you can have wisdom.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
You can know where you're supposed to choose.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
But if your mind is not developed,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
you will be swept

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
by the benevolence of kind of

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
predetermined directions

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
that you've been cultivating

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
for so long.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
This is the wrong thing.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
This is the wrong thing, too.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
But I can't help it,

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
because I'm too weak.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
But even then,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
you can say no to your weakness.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
So, you can always be a step ahead.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
And that's how reflection works.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
That's how intention works.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Or step above.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
So, you can ever

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
family and 15 kids

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and absolutely nothing stops you.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
The next moment,

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
you just walk out

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
and never come back.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Or from your job,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
or from any other form of responsibility,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
that you, yourself,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
have accumulated.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
And that is the accumulation.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Your ocean is an accumulation

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
of the water from the top.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
And then you complain,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
but you're the one

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
who left the tap open

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
and at the very top.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
So, nothing stops you.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
At any given time,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
you're just going to close it.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
And then,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
just walk out.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
But,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
what stops you is the weakness.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
So, that's why,

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
sometimes,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
people can do it

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
over a period of time

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
where they have built up

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
the determination to leave

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
or the determination

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
to send note,

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
whatever.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Or sometimes,

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
something extremely

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
to happen.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Like, in the cities,

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
when people met

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
with extreme misfortunes,

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
and think about misfortunes,

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
and that's not the matter

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
where they may not go the other way.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
All of the monks

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
who haven't been quite fully developed

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
in terms of Arachie,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
but they were there

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
with the right view and everything.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
And then,

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
they often die

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
when they were about to be

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
set on fire

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
by the highway

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
or whatever else.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
Then, they kind of abandoned it all internally.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
When, when,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
think got real.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
Yes, the person,

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
they're responsible for investing

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
in external things

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
like a family,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
investing in the sense,

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
believing at that.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
But, nothing stops you.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
They just walk out.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
That's going to give me happiness.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Nothing stops you.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
But, nothing stops you

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
to the next moment

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
to refuse to breathe.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
It's just obviously,

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
it's unpleasant

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
to not breathe.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
So, you never even consider it.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
But, breathing is another choice.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Neutral choice.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
But, something you keep doing.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
It's an action.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
So, nothing stops you

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
to refuse to take an extinguisher.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Nothing.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
And obviously,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
there's no point in not

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
taking an extinguisher.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
But, I'm just illustrated there.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
The point I'm making.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
So, you can say no

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
in any given time,

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
twenty-thing.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
And that's the nature of

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
the aggregate of choice,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
the aggregate of intention.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
You also?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
He has its own domain.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
In separable form,

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
inconceivable form,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
other aggregates,

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
but in itself,

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
it's an independent thing.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Does intention suffer?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
No, intention is intended.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Intentions suffer.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Feelings will be,

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
or feelings will be,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
the feeling suffer.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Every feeling is suffering.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Until you're another.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Where by feeling nothing,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
feelings are suffering.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Every feeling,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
the fact that you feel good about

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
pleasure or pain

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
or neutral,

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
dead suffering,

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
the fact that you're susceptible

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
to a feeling.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
So, feelings feel intentions intent,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
perception perceive.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
However, you can't possibly

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
take these three

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
and examine them

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
without the other two.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
They're always together.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
So, you can't,

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
okay, show.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
So, there is a degree of

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
independence

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
as a domain in perception

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
and feeling and intention.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
But they're inseparably

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
inconceivable without,

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
so you can't just think

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
about feeling

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
without involving perception

42:33.000 --> 42:40.000
and intention.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
But you can discern them.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
As they arise,

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
simultaneously,

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
as this kind of group,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
well, the three are,

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
you can,

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
you can still, within that,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
discern and,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
discern disseparably makes.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
And thus, intentions intent.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Feelings feel.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Why does intention intent this

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
or intention intent that?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Well, once you stop acting

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
out of your feelings,

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
once you fully understood

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
the feelings,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
you wouldn't be

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
intending based on how you feel

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
because there was inconceivable

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
to begin with.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Intentions cannot make

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
with feelings.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
It's a different domain,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
different aggregate.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
The completely oblivious

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
to each other.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Intentions are intentions.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
They intend.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Feelings are feeling they feel.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Intentions don't feel

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
or feelings do intend.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
But it's your ignorance

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
of region in regards to

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
the kind of maker homeless,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
whereby you end up intending

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
based on how you felt,

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
which was inconceivable to do,

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
but until you knew that it was

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
inconceivable,

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
you were doing it for that very reason.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
So then the question,

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
why did I intend this?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
So that becomes,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
well, inconceivable as well.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Why does intention intent?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Because it's an intention

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
that intends.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
That's what it works.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
And even the question,

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
did you ask,

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
why does this intent?

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
There was always an intention

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
that intended.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
They then tried to find

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
a reason for intention

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
elsewhere.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
In the feeling of whatever else,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
the projected notion of the world.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
But I can use,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
like that,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
the idea of,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
well, I can use that

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
design for pleasure

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
to dig me out.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
I think.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
You can use the design

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
for pleasant, pleasant.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Yeah.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
One thing to be free

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
from suffering is wanting

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
to experience peace,

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
which is from pleasure.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
I mean.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
But you have to discern

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
and what pleasure.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
And the word did, you know,

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
when you realize,

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
okay, hold on.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Not all the pleasure is bad.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Some of the pleasure is just pleasure.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
It does not necessarily

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
imply anything unhulsing,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
such as under-intensive.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
So bending all that pleasure,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
the one that's unhulsing,

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
and then it's fine.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
You won't have an issue.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Because then the pleasure

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
to the rises is that pleasure

44:59.000 --> 45:06.000
it's not unhulsing.

45:06.000 --> 45:13.000
So the design for pleasure

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
can be used to basically

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
develop wisdom to recognize that,

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
sure, I could go after immediate pleasure

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
or relatively immediate pleasure.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
But that won't bring any kind of,

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
well, they won't bring any freedom

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
from desire for pleasure.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
It will just maintain

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
the same desire for pleasure,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
which means that we're just revolving

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
on the circle.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And no matter how I'm doing the pleasure I get,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
the desire for pleasure remains intact,

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
which means I need more pleasure.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
I need other pleasure.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
I need different pleasure.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
I need same pleasure.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Repetitive.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Your mind is defeated.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Mind will need pleasure.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
So what if,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
and that section I'm present,

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
being in fact

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
by constant pursuit of pleasure?

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
I need to develop virtue.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
I need to.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
Sometimes I can't say no to it.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
Or sometimes what I desire for my pleasure

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
I simply can't get.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Thus I'll experience pain

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
in every step.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
So what if I abandon the whole thing?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
So that nothing can cause me pleasure of pain,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
thus I won't be disturbed.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
And then itself,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
that notion is very pleasant.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
So then you forsake the immediate pleasure

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
for the sake of that greater future pleasure

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
of peace,

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
of non-disturbance,

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
of the disturbance of, you know,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
the abandoning of suffering.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
Then you can also think about

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
yes, but looking into the future

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
is saying if I choose this now,

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
not going after the last four objects,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
not indulging in the past,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
then in the future,

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
I'll be free from all sorts of failures.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Well, yeah.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
As simple as that,

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
reflecting right here right now,

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
that if you choose to say no to the choice of last,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
means by not engaging the last,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
further down the line in the future,

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
you'll be able to see through the nature of that last.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
And then be free from it once and for all.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
So that's why the restraint

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
needs to come first.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
See that comes before the dharma.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
To get some photos of it.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Well, exactly.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
Because if you don't say no to it,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
then once you're in it,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
you can't be conceiving,

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
okay, now once I'm fully within the domain last,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
I can practice a separation from last,

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
being free from last.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
No, because you just place yourself in it.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Basically, again, the similarly from the sutras,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
trying to light the fire with the two sticks,

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
you need to dry them up.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
So if you had the two semi-dry sticks,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
and you choose to stay on the ground,

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
and say no to the water,

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
say no to the lust,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
then we'll dry out.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
And you can know that,

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
so all you need to do is resist the urge to go into water.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
That is very impressing at the time.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
But if you say no,

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
you know that I mentioned these sticks will dry,

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
and when they do dry,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
you can light the fire of knowledge,

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
and so on.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Even in the other hand,

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
you have the semi-dry sticks,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
and you choose to go back in the water,

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
no matter how much you wish for them to be dry,

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
you are in the water,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
they will not be dry.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
So you can't have any reasonable expectation

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
to light up the fire of knowledge

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
and see through the nature of lust,

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
because you just set yourself back in the water.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
You have to have it reasoned.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
Yeah, reasoned.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
For seeing it, expecting it,

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
knowing where it's going to lead,

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
and choosing the opposite.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
And that's why,

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
non-lust is,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
you can never go wrong with it,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
by saying no to lust,

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
or greed,

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
no to aversion,

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
or delusion.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
It can never result,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
in unwholesome.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
A renunciation can never result,

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
in unwholesome.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Which is why,

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
it is wholesome.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
It can never participate in anything unwholesome.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
So if you're ever in doubt,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
oh, should I say yes?

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
So no, just see which one has lust in it.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Which choice would have lust?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
If saying no implies lust,

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
then do the opposite.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
Yeah.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Like, oh,

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
if I stay here,

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
where, you know,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I'll be subjected to lustful impressions

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
or to anger impressions.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
So,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
if I stay here,

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
I leave myself acceptable to this thing so I'll go.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
So I won't say yes to stay here.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
I'll say no.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Oh,

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
if somebody says,

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
do what I,

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
do what I,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
do what I want to go elsewhere,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
and you know that that place is more risky

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
in terms of

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
inducing lust,

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
or aversion,

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
or whatever,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
then you say no to that.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
So you always say no to lust,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
aversion, delusion.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
But in volatile,

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
that might sometimes mean saying yes to certain things.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Yes.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Yes.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
I want to leave this place.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
No.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I don't want to stay here.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Or no.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
I want to go there.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Yes.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
I want to stay here.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
And that choice,

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
if there is wisdom,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
will be determined like which one is,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
which one implies non-lust,

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
or which one implies cessation of lust,

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
cessation of aversion,

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
cessation of aversion.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Sometimes it's not that clear.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
But then you see,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
well, which one is more likely

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
to be implying non-lust,

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
non-aversion,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
non-delusion.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
So that's what you choose.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Even though, oh, okay,

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
oops,

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
I went to this place and now it's,

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
it's filled with...

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Oops, yeah.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
But then within that,

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
you can choose the non-lust,

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
non-aversion,

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
that doesn't mean giving inferno.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Because you intended, firstly,

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
to go against the lust,

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
so that's the main.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Yes.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Yeah.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Whatever the external results come,

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
that's not...

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Exactly.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Because your choice was governed by the,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
by the kind of, well,

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
the criteria of renunciation

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
in terms of create aversion delusion.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
And that is the whole thing.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
So, yeah,

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
I have not been in the middle of the village,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
but I came there

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
through avoiding the other lust,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
and now here I can keep doing the same.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Because it's always a matter of choice.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
You know, last,

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
the version delusion can never,

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
like, be thrown on you

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
without your choice or say.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
You might not be able to say no to it,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
if you're not developing regard to it,

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
but it always remains...

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
But it's down to...

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
It's down to you,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
like it's the first end of kind of,

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
that's the standard that you start,

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
all the base.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
No...

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
I can't reach you in the middle of the illusion.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Yeah.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
I do my best to...

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
to do that.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
And then you can tell you that further,

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
even to your own thinking,

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
but you might not be doing anything

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
and also in terms of the body of the speech,

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
but your mind on this earlier

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
was things good stuff.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Then you take it there,

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
and then address that.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
It's always sometimes the other way

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
or how I want to go for a retreat.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
You can give me a brief instruction,

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
and say, you know,

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
I can ponder on it.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Okay, whatever you know,

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
it's an awesome abandoning,

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
whatever you know,

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
it's awesome cultivating.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
That's it.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Three months later,

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
Ireland emerges from the retreat,

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
because that's all they're kind of

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
doing, and it's enough to communicate.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I like that, because it's...

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
it's set up...

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
a person that...

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
what is an awesome...

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
what is...

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Yeah.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Awesome.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Because then it sets up

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
that whole contemplation,

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
having to watch the choice,

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
having to...

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Everything you build on double-end and double-end.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Yes.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
What's it?

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Am I?

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Oh, is this a good choice?

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Is this whole interest or not?

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Well, have a look.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Is it based...

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
is it founded in your desire?

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Yeah.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
In what desire is it founded?

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Like, I'm only going to live on top of the mountain,

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
where it's quiet, undisturbed,

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
solitude, so I can practice.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
That's a good desire.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
That's a desire that I can tell.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
It has a good...

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
good chance of resulting in fear from something.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
It's a mother person.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
I want to...

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
externally, it can look the same.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
I want to go and live on top of the mountain,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
free from people, free from disturbance.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Why?

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Because I...

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
hate them.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
I can't live with them.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
I can't stand them.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
I can't...

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Listen to what people...

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
They are a source of my anger.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Yeah.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Yeah, whatever.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
So, out of that anger, I want to run,

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
they will be protected from the disturbances.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
But, not necessarily, I want to run,

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
they're okay.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
I can't deal with this anger.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
So, I want to run from the anger,

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
where I will address that anger,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
so that I can never ever be angry in the future.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
If you see it...

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
No.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Basically, this is what bothers me.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
I'll just shout it.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
And how you shout it?

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I'll shout it by going to the different monastery.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
When the monastery starts bothering me,

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
I go to another monastery.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
And I go, they don't live on top of the hill,

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
when nobody will disturb me.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
But I myself won't be doing anything about the possibility

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
to be disturbed in the first place.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Because that's a problem.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
The problem is not that you've been disturbed

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
through anger or lust.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
The problem is that you lie about it.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
So, even if anger or lust never ever arise in the future,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
if it remains as a possibility,

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
it means you're still within the domain of anger and lust.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Which means there's no question,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
no idea, like, notion of freedom there.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Not a real one at least.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
So, that's what you recognize.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
It's not about me suffering right now.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It's about possibility to suffer in the future.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
And that's suffering in itself.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
That concern is unpleasant.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
And if you undo that,

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
then you can't suffer in the present, by anything.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
So, if you cease to be liable to aversion,

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
liable to lust, liable to delusion,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
even if you're in the middle of the village,

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
nobody can make you angry.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Nobody can make you lustful.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
So, yes, I'll bend you knee to extract yourself.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Ah, from it.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
But you have to be clear as to why are you doing so.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
Whether your desire is rooted in genuine desire

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
to be free from suffering down the line,

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
or if it's rooted in simple desire to run away.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Oh, this bothers me.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
I'll go and things are more pleasant and peaceful.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
But then, you know,

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
you won't be in control of the new situation,

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
fundamentally, so when that changes,

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
that's when you have people who look like,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
I don't know, I've helped me live for whatever

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
for 20-30 years,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
and if they ever end up back in the community

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
or in a hospital,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
they're just losing.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Nothing.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
No involvement.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Nothing.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
And then you have the other people

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
who might have seen a degree of this,

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
but then they develop a viewer account of it,

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
which overrides the current experience,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
now that's why I've used the dangerous,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
because you can like contradict exactly

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
what you're experiencing.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
So they might have been developing a view

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
that, no, you should never leave the group of people,

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
because there will be only running away.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
Not necessarily.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
It can be running away if that's what you act out of.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
But if you act out of,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I'm going to run away from this right now,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
so that I can deal with it fully,

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
so that then I wouldn't care whether I'm alone or without this.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
No, that's a good running away.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
But people who kind of might have seen the danger running away

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
or met a few people who ran away,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
then they came back and lost it.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
Then without trying themself,

55:59.000 --> 56:04.000
without distinguishing the nature of the motive in itself,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
then they're working the view that no.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
Leaving the group, leaving the setting is bad.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
No, no.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
You make it good or bad depending on the reasons for your action.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Depending whether it was rooted in wholesome or unwholesome.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
And the view is unwholesome.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
Why? Because you just override any good and bad by saying it's bad.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
Because it can be good or can be bad depending on why you do it.

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
Like leaving the group, going to live alone or similar.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
You can't.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
But you can put a blanket rule over it.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
You just cover it with a bed and that's bad.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
Now you cover it all up and now you can't see the nature.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Which means there won't be any discernment of wholesome.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
I'm rooted in wholesome, rooted in our wholesome.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
You decided before that.

56:49.000 --> 56:56.000
Yeah, I mean both of those things are the externals.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
It's because of the external things.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
Yeah.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
That's one sufferer.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Yeah.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
So therefore I will stay in a community because...

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
To keep the external things in the same way so I want something.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
Because being in it, there's many people that helps.

57:13.000 --> 57:21.000
And it's not incidental that always those views that are kind of pasted over the actual particular things that you might be experiencing.

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
Those views are always fueled by the unwholesome.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Well, not taking responsibility.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Yeah, that's it.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
So basically I will condemn everybody that leaves the group.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Why?

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
Because deep down inside, they're terrified to do it myself.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Or I will condemn the group.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Why?

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Because deep down inside, I'm incapable of living without a people.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I just find it intolerable.

57:44.000 --> 57:54.000
So basically people end up adopting the views based on the underlying kind of notions that are unwholesome.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
Either fear, or hate, or lust, or whatever.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
Oh, or like, oh, I've long been going to the level of the Mahadevastani.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Because the community is good.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
It's good to help people.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
It's good.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
And deep down inside, I'm simply afraid to go without food.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
Sometimes it can be as simple as that.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
I'm afraid that my food will be too rough on the mountain.

58:15.000 --> 58:22.000
So I'll find every single justification to stay in the monastery.

58:22.000 --> 58:32.000
Including meeting people, distractions, engagements, duties, sense of importance, sense of accomplishment, sense of career, sense of whatever else.

58:32.000 --> 58:40.000
And again, I met quite a fair deal of other people who know being a monk is about living alone in the forest and doing this.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Why?

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
Because they have such serious issues that they can't stand.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
Anyone, no matter how kind, good they are to them.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
They just pure hatred towards another.

58:51.000 --> 59:01.000
So the only way for me to remain in this kind of setting that I sort of ended up in

59:01.000 --> 59:08.000
is to run away from everybody and hide in the forest and just keep it to a bare minimum meeting with others because I just can't stand it.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
And I don't have to do it.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
But I just lose my composition every single time.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Yet externally, you can paint either of those.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
I'm also mean that's awesome.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
No.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
But I said you live in the forest.

59:19.000 --> 59:23.000
Well, he said something else in conjunction with that.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
He said only those who are ready to live in the forest should live in the forest.

59:27.000 --> 59:34.000
I said, you're going to say you should keep it in the community. He said, yes, he said only those who are kind of capable of keeping it in the community should keep it in the community.

59:34.000 --> 59:42.000
So he did not adopt a law that kind of overrides everything else regardless of the actual particular circumstances.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
And that's why he wouldn't have made all those tangos mandatory.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
And when they were not as requested, they didn't know.

59:49.000 --> 59:57.000
A railroad should be mandatory. He came from one board should be mandatory. He said, no, let those from one over there go where that goes.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Let those who don't want to do it don't want to do it.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And whether they want to do it or not want to do it should be determined through their understanding of awesome and awesome.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So the person who understood awesome is an awesome will want awesome.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And being an ascetic is not necessarily awesome for everyone because people can do it from very wrong reasons.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
But they're basically standardly, one starts them. I want to be free from suffering.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I can't do it too much, pay attention or give in to the last four green hand people to do it.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So you can find that exactly that thing to the extent whereby you have inspiration to go out of the monastery and live in the mountains.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And then you recognize it.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.000
It's not necessarily coming out of unwholesome, but it's coming out of well intoxication that came with inspiration.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And you realize well, there might be a great deal of delusion involved in this because I'm not acting out of genuine recognition that this will be good for me.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I'm acting because I'm so inspired and full of energy to do it.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So you take it cautiously.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:36.000
So you go halfway up the mountain, so I have to speak and see if that's bringing awesome to increase, unwholesome to decrease, or all the way around.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
If it's all the way around, we'll go back and restart it another time.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But also it clears up the quote when you have the question, what should I do?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Well, exactly.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I don't do those. That's what I'm intending on with people talking. So whatever I do.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So it's not bad to have sexual intercourse, not bad to have a wife, not bad to have kids.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
No, it's not. Depending on what you want to do.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Depending on what you want to do.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000
People think in terms of the eternal judgement, this is bad, this is good.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It depends on what you want to do.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Yeah, killing is always bad.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Breaking five precepts is always bad.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000
That's why it's the basic requirement that distinguishes humans from animals if they stick to it.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
So there are those in there.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
But let me ask you further on.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Well, I'm not judging people who are families and I want to leave it.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I'm just saying that if this is what you want to do, well, that contradicts it.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
So you can't have it both ways.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I'm generally in practitioner with a teaching and at the same time, being engaged in a sexual intercourse,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
whatever, will you not?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Because the Buddha said himself, you can't have it both.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
So that's exactly the thing.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:07.000
It's more like you recognize for yourself whether the things you want to do, your choices, your intentions,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
even the way you attend to things.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I've been rooted in lust, awareness, delusion or not.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
But some of you must.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Externally, that's irrelevant.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Like there is a basis of the five precepts or eight precepts later on.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But then everything else in between can be very good and very bad externally.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
But internally, actually, you are the only one that would know.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Oh no, it's good.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
It's good to go.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It's good to sit on a group retreat.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
That's something.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I'm necessarily.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I would say it's like a...

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Yeah, I want to be...

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I want to give a craving for another person.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I want to give up craving for sexual activity.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But I'm just not ready for that right now.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Maybe in the future.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You chose to not be ready.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You chose to...

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That to be the case.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And sometimes, you know, things...

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Again, it depends on what you attend.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Like things you get very subtle.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So, it's not necessarily bad.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Or rather, it's not necessarily an awesome, but it can be an awesome.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So, say you're hungry.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So, you need the food in order to not die.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
But then, at the same time, you choose only the food that you like.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So, you're...

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So, you're clearly, basically, acting out of lust for tasters.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
That kind of also implies eating the food.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But that's why you should, like, attend carefully.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Like, we know the contemplation that we chant in the morning

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
back in the monastery.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Like, the reason why you eat.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Like, okay, there's no question you abstain from sex.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
You abstain from killing. You're safe from lying.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
But you can't abstain from eating because you'll die.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So, you have to eat.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Then you can say, well, I will only...

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Only things I don't like.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Well, that's not...

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
That's, again, putting on an external decision.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Because if you do only what you don't like,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
then you might start liking torturing yourself.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
You might start enjoying that unhulsingly.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Hence, there won't be any wisdom arising.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
No, so you just want to make sure that while you're eating,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
you make sure that your act of eating

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
doesn't get rooted in an awesome denial for the pleasant taste.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So then you won't be running away from nice food that you like,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
that you liked, but you won't be affected by it.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
That's the thing.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Because people think, oh, I really want to eat dish A

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
on a kind of dish B, which I don't really like.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
So I should really go with what I don't like.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
But that's just like projecting it externally.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Like putting responsibility on that which you don't like.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Saying, I will choose what I don't like.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Sure, you can do it once or twice.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
But sooner or later, you will get dependent on the view

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
to always do the opposite of what you want to do.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
I, you will become dependent on the view

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
to torture yourself, to cause, to intentionally flick paint you.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
So, sooner or later, you can't sustain it.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But what you want to do basically is recognize I have to eat.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So whether it dish A or B doesn't matter.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I prefer dish A to dish B.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I might eat both and then remain mindful in terms of the dish B

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
to not be hating and thinking about dish A while I meet in dish B.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And at the same time while I meet in dish A,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
to not be like, well, overjoyed on account of it

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
or careless in regard to the experience of taste of the dish A.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So you may be mindful in regard to both tastes because you have to eat.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And above all, you remain mindful as to why you have to eat

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
in order to sustain the body.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
If that thought, literally, if that thought remains established in you,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
you will not overdo the joy when it comes to the dish you like.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Nor will you be too concerned when it comes to dish you don't like.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Why? Because the point is to eat whatever.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And you remain rooted in that.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
True mindfulness means there won't be any rise given to the other person.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
You canlessly attend to what you are eating.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
You forget why you are eating or rather you forget to root things

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
in the right reasons for eating.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You will inevitably be taken by what?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
By the senses. You will be taken by that which is the strongest,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
which is the pull of the taste.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So that's why the same act of eating can be rooted in completely

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
and you're responsible for that.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
So you don't have to.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And when you start losing yourself properly and establishing from that,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
then you wouldn't care as the Buddha said.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Like I have disciples who live only on one land full of rice every second day.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
While at that time, I would be eating like the finest curry.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And I would sometimes eat a bowl full to the brim with the food.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And then I would have another one.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
So he would eat two arms bowls to the brim of the nicest food.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
While he has disciples who live on a handful of rice,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
if there was the goal of practice to live and have,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
they would not be respecting him any in any way whatsoever.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
But the goal of the practice is to not be affected by the food,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
to not be affected by the senses,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000
to not be rooted in unwholesome based on the pull of the senses.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
That's the goal of the practice.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So whether it's a present taste, touch, sounds, maison,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
it will not pull you into unwholesome.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
That's the goal of the practice.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
When you establish that, then you can eat whatever.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
You establish the principle and then you're not pulled.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So then, yeah, the Buddha can have the finest silk robes

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
and three bowls of food in front of him if he wants.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And you'll still respect him as much as you did on the first day

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
when he was just living as an ascetic.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Now when he's found frequented by the kings,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and you'll respect him.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
In the same sense, why?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Because you know where the goal is,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and you understood what his teaching was,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
and that teaching freed you from suffering.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
So you might choose to live under a little tree

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
enjoying one handful of rice every three days,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
because you don't need more,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
and that's what makes you happy and content,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
and not disturbed and peaceful.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Yet you'll still respect him while he lives in a palace.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Because that was never the point of the practice.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Yeah, the external.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Yeah, it's good.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Every teacher says it's very similar thing about food.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Being at a banquet tonight.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Food that comes your way.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
You just take up what you need.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
If you don't like to call and grab a piece more than you.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You happen to come across,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
that like showers' food comes,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
happens to be in your head.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
You have it because you need to eat.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yeah.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
If it's very low food, just like that.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
And if you don't know,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
just reestablish the mindfulness into why you need to eat,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
and keep that thought while you're eating.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
For as long as that thought is present while you're eating,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
no matter to what degree it's present,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
sometimes more, sometimes less,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
feel establishing the mindfulness.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And as an anchor,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
you're beating for the right reasons,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
no matter what.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And that's, you know,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I remember I met people amongst

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
who, obviously,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
a big downer,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
loads of food.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I had 50 dishes.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
And then,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
instead of taking responsibility

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
for the fact that you have to eat,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and then eating what, you know,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
you find agreeable,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
not necessarily always what you really, really like,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
but say, you know,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I don't like certain things,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
but I'll take them.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Because I learned that they're very nutritional,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
that they can keep me going further.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
So I would have to eat less.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
You go for that even if you don't like.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Sometimes I find out that this really thing

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
that I really happen to like.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I really, I love the taste of that.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
It's also very, very good for you.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I'll take that.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I will not forget why I need to eat.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But then those monks

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
would not necessarily think like,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
well, they would not descend to their level,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
so they would recognize the problem of preference.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
The kind of preference is not a problem,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
but preference in juicing last is a problem.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
But instead of recognizing that

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
it's taking up responsibility for it,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
they try to deny it.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
So they would either always take what they don't like.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I always take what I want less.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
That means, okay, so you're basically attributing

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
choice to the view of going after

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
that which is less desirable.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I am not responsible.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
There are three choices.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I'll go for the one I least want.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
But that's already something you've chosen beforehand.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
But now you're attributing it.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And then I even make some months for like,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
saying, I will take only every third dish,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
whatever that dish might be.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Which means, so now you're attributing

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
responsibility to the chance.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
See, all of that is irrelevant, actually,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
if they were to remain mindful as to why they're eating.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
But clearly, the failure of putting an importance

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
of how the dishes are chosen

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
means they're not mindful when they were eating.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Why? Because, hey, I didn't choose out of my preference.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I've chosen out of this every third dish algorithm

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
that I wrote.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Thus, I can forget about because now it's fine.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Whatever I hate my ball, it's fine.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
None of it is fine.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
That's how you should start.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
No food is fine to eat.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Good or bad?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You only have to eat because you want to survive.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And if you keep that, then you wouldn't care

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
what food is in your bowl,

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
whether it's tasty or not.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Because you realize none of it is fine.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
But they all come from the point of view that food is fine.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
There's a somewhere that is a bigger problem than the other.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Then you try to avoid by choosing the opposite.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Point being, none of that would actually be a problem for them.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
If they were to remain mindful

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
why they're eating as to why.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Why they're eating as to why they're eating.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Hungry food, though.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
This is impossible to eat without giving in

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
to the sense domain of taste,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
to the animal that pertains to that domain, to that pool.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
But what can do is keep it in check.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I let it eat because it needs to eat.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
But I'll keep it in check as to how grounded

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I'll change it to the reason why I'm eating.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Which is to sustain this body no more.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
So on some days they will be food that their animal likes.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
The sense of taste finds it agreeable.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
They find it disagreeable.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
But you won't be bothered by going through all this effort

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
of always finding a disagreeable taste.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Because you realize agreeable, disagreeable both are on the same domain.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
And that's not the problem.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
The problem is that that was affected by it.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And you can be equally affected by disagreeable.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Because sometimes if you don't,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
like if you always go around choosing the disagreeable taste,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
sometimes you're presented by tastes

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and none of them is disagreeable.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
What are you going to choose then?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Then you won't be able to not be affected by a agreeable taste.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Because you were running away from it into disagreeable.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Which was also the level of taste.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So you don't care about a agreeable taste or disagreeable taste.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
You care about the nature of taste affecting you.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
And that can be undone or that can be accomplished.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Not being affected by that can be accomplished simply.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
But remaining mindful as to why do you need,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
why you need to give in to the taste in the first place.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Big agreeable, disagreeable, neutral.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
And when you keep mind, when you develop enough mindfulness

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
in regard to that, then you wouldn't care what you're eating.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
You wouldn't care what you're choosing.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
You wouldn't care how you're choosing.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
You wouldn't care if somebody else puts the food in your bowl

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
or if you're going to put the food in your bowl.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
You wouldn't care if you're just going to choose the agreeable taste.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Because you're not affected by agreeable,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
none more than you're affected by disagreeable.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
You know, you'll be on both.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And then you won't be overeating.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Out of indulgence, you won't be under eating.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Under eating, you will just be eating.
