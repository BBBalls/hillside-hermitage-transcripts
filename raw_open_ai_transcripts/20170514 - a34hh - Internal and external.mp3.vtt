WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.800
So, did you ever not talk about it?

00:10.800 --> 00:14.760
I was thinking maybe you had something in mind since you don't get to come here often,

00:14.760 --> 00:15.760
I'll be living here.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.600
Unless you want to just hear me ask.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.600
Yeah, that would be all right.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.240
He's been asking us today for a few days, you told me.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.840
So one thing I was just curious about, how your interpretation about a certain suit that

00:31.840 --> 00:38.640
this is from the Sun Utinakaya, I think Kanda Sunita, it's the one where the buddha compares

00:38.640 --> 00:45.440
form to a lump of foam, feelings to bubble, remember that one?

00:45.440 --> 00:51.640
So for example, one of the stanzas says, be goo-supposed that this river Ganges was carrying

00:51.640 --> 00:57.240
a great law, a great pimp of foam, and then with good sight, we inspect it, wander it,

00:57.240 --> 01:02.240
and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, and substantial.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.040
So what substance could there be in a lump of foam?

01:06.040 --> 01:11.240
So two begoos, whatever kind of form there is, but it past, feature, or present, internal

01:11.240 --> 01:17.920
or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, the begoo-inspects it, bond

01:17.920 --> 01:22.320
with it, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow,

01:22.320 --> 01:28.520
and substantial, for what substance could there be in form?

01:28.520 --> 01:33.520
Now this is just a translation, I don't know off the top of my head, what the exact

01:33.520 --> 01:37.520
polyword is, for void, hollow, and substantial.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.520
Inspec, as well?

01:39.520 --> 01:40.520
Yeah.

01:40.520 --> 01:45.520
I can look up the polyword if I can make two.

01:45.520 --> 01:53.520
So I don't know if it's just a translation, but to me, it makes it sound like that kind

01:53.520 --> 02:00.320
of, you know, emptiness formed, form is emptiness kind of thing, where out form doesn't actually

02:00.320 --> 02:04.120
exist, it's just a lump, like a foam, there's no center to it.

02:04.120 --> 02:10.320
Well, no, see that thing, nobody says it doesn't exist, this means it's hollow and void,

02:10.320 --> 02:13.320
in its existence.

02:13.320 --> 02:18.080
It doesn't mean you denial the actual appearance of the bubble, of the foam.

02:18.080 --> 02:24.560
So you recognize the nature of that, which is, well, very, very transient, so to speak,

02:24.560 --> 02:28.120
without any everlasting substance.

02:28.120 --> 02:32.160
And then you recognize the same characteristic in this very form.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.840
But that doesn't mean that the whole thing does not exist, which is, and that's exactly

02:38.840 --> 02:46.000
like what you, what you have, what you have just said, the emptiness formed form is emptiness.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.240
Sure, that's true, in a general sense.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.240
But now, what would a person mean by that?

02:52.240 --> 02:55.640
And often they mean the denial, the denial of things.

02:55.640 --> 03:00.120
I'm curious, I mean, it's not real, it's not there, no, it is there, as empty.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.280
If there's nothing there, you can't distinguish even emptiness.

03:03.280 --> 03:08.560
But if nothing is there, there's actually no reference point for full or empty substance

03:08.560 --> 03:10.240
or no substance.

03:10.240 --> 03:18.880
So it is very real, but it's fleeting, it's non-substantial, so to speak.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.320
But as such, it is real.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.960
So that's why you recognize that, and then you apply the same to the, to your form,

03:24.960 --> 03:31.680
to the form that pertains to the sense of self-wide, because sense of self cannot be established

03:31.680 --> 03:38.840
upon that, which is fleeting, and non-substantial, and invoicing, and hollow, and transient.

03:38.840 --> 03:43.320
So applying that to that upon which your sense of self depends undermines the sense of

03:43.320 --> 03:45.680
self.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.720
But leaves the bubbles of the form intact, they were always that.

03:50.720 --> 03:56.920
What has changed is your attitude in regard to them, appropriation they used to exist upon

03:56.920 --> 04:05.760
the assumption that there is substance in it, there is the actual ground for the self.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.760
That has changed, that's gone, and then there's appropriation constant.

04:08.760 --> 04:14.120
And so the same thing applies, and for the rest of the similes, I suppose, the perceptions

04:14.120 --> 04:15.120
like an illusion.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.200
Yeah, for all the other things, yeah, inventions like a plantain.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.720
Yeah, see that whole thing, I thought, it's an illusion.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.920
Yeah, it is, you can regard it, it's an illusion, but again, it doesn't mean that it's

04:24.920 --> 04:27.880
not real as such.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.040
No, we're in the city, it doesn't say it does not exist, it's an illusion, and it does

04:31.040 --> 04:32.040
not exist.

04:32.040 --> 04:38.840
Yet, when you say illusion, and maybe that's because of all of the other schools of Buddhism

04:38.840 --> 04:48.120
or other religious practices, people nowadays, you say illusion, and it's not real, but illusion

04:48.120 --> 04:49.120
is real.

04:49.120 --> 04:53.520
If you weren't really, you wouldn't be in that first place.

04:53.520 --> 04:59.680
It's real as such, it's basically illusion, it's different to what you think it is.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.040
So you're deluded by it.

05:02.040 --> 05:07.840
And when that changes, which you were deluded by in the beginning, it still remains.

05:07.840 --> 05:14.120
Now, what has changed is your delusion in regard to it, that's gone, but the thing remains.

05:14.120 --> 05:24.200
It's like, the essay, Tharmath is such an illusion, and going to that way.

05:24.200 --> 05:30.240
The last one, which I don't know if I have always thought too far into it, but even this

05:30.240 --> 05:37.080
one, you know, there are works that go very deep into detail, whether they're right or wrong.

05:37.080 --> 05:44.000
Like, in this magic of the mind, I think, one of his books where he compares consciousness

05:44.000 --> 05:48.960
to a magician's show, it's saying, suppose a magician or a magician's apprentice would

05:48.960 --> 05:54.000
display a magical illusion at the crossroads, and as bits I would expect it ponder so

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
and so on and so forth, and same thing for consciousness now.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.600
Now, do you think this similist would be digging just as saying that, yeah, it's, you know,

06:03.600 --> 06:10.960
not substantiate this consciousness, like you're saying, form, or is there more to be

06:10.960 --> 06:16.760
send from that similist, like, oh, it's like a disceptive, or it's misleading, or something?

06:16.760 --> 06:24.560
Well, yeah, you can, yeah, you can say that basically, it's, you have misled yourself with

06:24.560 --> 06:28.320
assumptions in regard to consciousness.

06:28.320 --> 06:35.320
So the magician's performance, if that's the similist, it's really such, it's a magician's

06:35.320 --> 06:41.840
performance, this is what it's done, or your belief upon it, that's on you.

06:41.840 --> 06:47.240
And the most basic deception, the most basic misconception, it's regarding a permanent

06:47.240 --> 06:53.560
that which is impermanent, regarding pleasurable that which is suffering, and then taking that

06:53.560 --> 07:05.840
thing to be yourself, which cannot be, and that's like the fundamental illusion.

07:05.840 --> 07:10.760
So there's, there's no problem in people regarding, oh, this is all illusion, sure, as long

07:10.760 --> 07:17.160
as you don't blame things for that illusion, but blame your own attitude towards it.

07:17.160 --> 07:21.840
But usually, whenever I've heard, oh, illusion, illusion, it was said in a dismissive sense,

07:21.840 --> 07:26.160
whereby, oh, this is all illusion, this is all not real, there is no problem, there is

07:26.160 --> 07:30.160
no nibbana, there is nothing which is already nibbana, which is everything and nothing.

07:30.160 --> 07:35.520
It's just to become, having all sorts of views, because you've just blanked the mind of everything.

07:35.520 --> 07:42.120
But sure, illusion is real as such, so stop being deluded by that illusion and see through

07:42.120 --> 07:43.120
what it is.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.840
And what it is, it's impermanent and suffering, thus it cannot be taken to be yourself, cannot

07:47.840 --> 07:51.800
be taken to belong to you, and that's it, that's all it is.

07:51.800 --> 07:58.020
Bubbles will, and the phone will keep arising for as long as there is a river foaming and

07:58.020 --> 07:59.020
so on.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.760
But when that river drains up, I, when the aggregate breaks apart, that's it, it's per nibbana

08:02.760 --> 08:10.760
and they will not arise again, not even those illusory bubbles and similarly.

08:10.760 --> 08:21.600
Another question that I was, you mentioned, an internal external a lot, I was hoping that

08:21.600 --> 08:29.200
we could clarify exactly those terms, like I know it's kind of a broad question, but

08:29.200 --> 08:33.240
if you general, you know, the Buddha on the side said internal external, both internal

08:33.240 --> 08:39.680
external, not even self-ifatana, but I guess the question, I'm trying to figure out

08:39.680 --> 08:49.080
is like, internal it to what, what is, what defines internal or its external, and is that

08:49.080 --> 08:54.360
if it's, you know, the first ends of the mind is, so internal is mind, external, not, but

08:54.360 --> 08:58.240
then the question is, is it valid to look at things like that?

08:58.240 --> 09:07.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, usually, yeah, there is a degree of mind associated with internal

09:07.800 --> 09:09.280
dimension.

09:09.280 --> 09:14.040
But again, broadly speaking, because it is a broad question, an internal external is sometimes

09:14.040 --> 09:20.400
using not always the same sense, as, as, and I think a Buddha said, basically, internal

09:20.400 --> 09:25.720
would be everything that pertains to you, and an external it would be everything that

09:25.720 --> 09:29.400
doesn't pertain to you.

09:29.400 --> 09:37.200
So that's like the broadest, broadest distinction, but obviously fundamentally, like for

09:37.200 --> 09:42.480
an out of hand, for example, there is this conscious body left, and all the name and form

09:42.480 --> 09:46.000
external.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.360
So you can see that that would choose to be his, like this conscious body, it doesn't

09:51.360 --> 09:55.720
say, oh, the conscious body is left internally for an out of hand, and name and form external,

09:55.720 --> 10:00.280
it says, what is left is this conscious body, and name and form externally.

10:00.280 --> 10:05.600
So in that sense, when internal means mind, that is gone.

10:05.600 --> 10:11.280
So now that which used to be taken as mind is still there, but it's not internal in that

10:11.280 --> 10:17.880
personal sense, because more often than not, that which pertains to oneself is what

10:17.880 --> 10:24.520
is once, what, what, what he has appropriated, does internal and mind do become almost interchangeable

10:24.520 --> 10:29.400
when it comes to the attitude of people, but they don't need to do it this way.

10:29.400 --> 10:36.000
So when the business is something like kaya, kaya, nipus, tv, i would be like mindful of

10:36.000 --> 10:40.040
the body in terms of, or in the body, everyone translates it internally, externally, whatever

10:40.040 --> 10:41.040
you.

10:41.040 --> 10:48.680
You're saying that it's a question of like seeing one's present attitude of taking the

10:48.680 --> 10:53.920
body as mind, me, myself, but being mindful of that otherwise.

10:53.920 --> 10:59.520
But you can, that, that in sati-potanasu basically means you can, if you take it, if you're mindful

10:59.520 --> 11:04.720
of the body internally, you're mindful from the point of view of this conscious body

11:04.720 --> 11:05.720
here.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.800
You can be mindful of the same body externally, if you approach it from the point of view

11:09.800 --> 11:17.000
of nama-rupa, which is external, even if it's looking at your own body.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.240
So you always have two points of view at the same time, that is the, that is the like

11:21.240 --> 11:24.720
of that, that the fundamentals of every human experience, what, what the experience of

11:24.720 --> 11:26.840
the five aggregates.

11:26.840 --> 11:32.560
And because you have two points of view, there can't be one sent to them, one owner of

11:32.560 --> 11:33.560
them.

11:33.560 --> 11:37.360
Because they are simultaneously arising independent of each other.

11:37.360 --> 11:42.960
This conscious body, nama-form externally.

11:42.960 --> 11:47.880
So if you're seeing the body in the experience of the nama-form externally, that body is

11:47.880 --> 11:48.880
externally.

11:48.880 --> 11:55.160
If, if you're attending to the body on the aspect of this conscious body right here, because

11:55.160 --> 11:59.160
of which I have this experience as a whole, that is the internal body.

11:59.160 --> 12:04.160
So here you're saying distinction is like, internal will be like my sense of what my body

12:04.160 --> 12:09.480
is, like the idea of my body, like for example, I'm mindful of my body seated, but not because

12:09.480 --> 12:12.880
I'm seeing it, because I know that would be, that would be the external.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.880
That's external too.

12:13.880 --> 12:14.880
That would be external.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.880
So the more internal.

12:16.880 --> 12:22.480
Exactly, internal dimension is the dimension whereby if you, obviously, attend it externally,

12:22.480 --> 12:24.960
it's not the internal dimension.

12:24.960 --> 12:30.240
The internal dimension is a conscious body right here, because of which you can doubt what

12:30.240 --> 12:34.920
the internal dimension right here is, it's because the internal dimension is already there.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.240
So, it's not excessive.

12:37.240 --> 12:44.680
Well, it's accessible only through discernment, so to speak, which is why if you discern it,

12:44.680 --> 12:46.640
you can't appropriate it anymore.

12:46.640 --> 12:51.360
You can only appropriate it when you don't know what it is, then it's mine.

12:51.360 --> 12:55.520
Then this very notion of internal is the notion of mine.

12:55.520 --> 12:59.720
When it's discern, when there is no ignorance in regard to it, there is no mine in regard

12:59.720 --> 13:00.720
to it.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.720
That's for an art hand.

13:01.720 --> 13:08.000
It's just this conscious body, and name and form, it's turn of it.

13:08.000 --> 13:16.200
I don't get it.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.200
No, I don't, I don't.

13:17.200 --> 13:23.200
This conscious body is the, it doesn't appear.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.200
Yes, and yes, it sticks to the negative.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.200
You can say that.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.520
I mean, the appears as a negative, but yeah, if you make the positive, then it becomes

13:31.520 --> 13:34.200
also external, which is not this conscious body.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.200
That's then it's external.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.200
Yeah.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.200
Yeah.

13:38.200 --> 13:49.200
So the external name and form is because of that which external name and form is here.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.200
Because of that.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.200
Say it again.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.200
External name and form.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.200
Yes.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.200
Because of that, because of which external name and form is here.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.200
Yeah, sure.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.200
You can say that.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.200
And that's what I mean when I say that in a way, everything is here.

14:03.200 --> 14:09.200
You can say that, and that's what I mean when I say that in a way, everything is external

14:09.200 --> 14:10.200
to you.

14:10.200 --> 14:14.000
In other words, nothing can be mine.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.840
So if you want to, if you want to, if you start, if a person suspects in this patient,

14:19.840 --> 14:24.720
then the result will be like what is taking to be internal as mine, and then the opposing

14:24.720 --> 14:26.040
role external.

14:26.040 --> 14:30.480
Well, those components, so to speak, remain, but what changes is the attitude in regard

14:30.480 --> 14:31.480
to them.

14:31.480 --> 14:36.760
So really, it becomes more accurate to say there is external, external, and there is the

14:36.760 --> 14:42.400
less external, which used to be internal.

14:42.400 --> 14:48.480
That the internal sense that one's body appears, if it appears, it appears on the level

14:48.480 --> 14:49.480
of Namah Rupa.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.480
So because of that.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.480
And it's such an external.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.480
Yeah.

14:52.480 --> 14:57.920
Obviously, for a protugina, when all that is taken as mine, it takes a Namah Rupa to be

14:57.920 --> 15:02.520
his, and whatever pertains to his body, so it's all a mess, obviously.

15:02.520 --> 15:07.200
But yeah, if it is designated into a phenomenon, positive phenomenon, then it's Namah Rupa,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.000
then it is external as such.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Right.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.440
Because I've understood your statement to somebody in the past where it's like the body that

15:14.440 --> 15:20.160
you can't direct the access, but that by which there is feeling, conscious, or whatever.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.160
Yeah.

15:21.160 --> 15:25.140
You cannot access that directly through feeling, consciousness, perception, because it

15:25.140 --> 15:28.880
receives them structurally.

15:28.880 --> 15:35.920
But you can discern that this body, that you do see externally as a part of Namah Rupa

15:35.920 --> 15:42.760
when it arises as such, is that because of which presence right here and now, this whole

15:42.760 --> 15:45.640
experience is in the first place.

15:45.640 --> 15:52.000
And is that presence right here and now, it's what this conscious body is?

15:52.000 --> 16:00.880
So perhaps one could say then that an internal sense of one's body is kind of like consciousness,

16:00.880 --> 16:01.880
like negative.

16:01.880 --> 16:06.440
It is not, yeah, because this conscious body, it comes in a bundle, right?

16:06.440 --> 16:10.800
You can't separate it one from the other, you can't conceive even university consciousness

16:10.800 --> 16:15.840
apart from the form of the body, nor can you even ponder on the notion of body if there

16:15.840 --> 16:18.120
is no consciousness in regard to it.

16:18.120 --> 16:22.880
So what happens is, with the appropriation, then whatever resembles this conscious body

16:22.880 --> 16:27.200
is just, as it has been piled up on top of that negative phenomenon, and then it becomes

16:27.200 --> 16:28.200
quite positive.

16:28.200 --> 16:35.440
The positive internal of a putuginal, which for him is mine.

16:35.440 --> 16:42.080
So in that sense, internal, perhaps a designation, so a designation, but can't have one of

16:42.080 --> 16:45.160
the gardens, a designation, that's important, would you agree?

16:45.160 --> 16:46.160
Yes, of course.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.840
A designation would never have a problem.

16:49.840 --> 16:55.760
So people think designation is a problem, and they try not saying, I or I am or I will,

16:55.760 --> 16:57.240
because there is no self.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.240
Yeah.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.120
No, the boy, and then was happening to the putuginal, and he said, no, the pilot still uses those

17:02.120 --> 17:06.600
words, those terms, but he knows them as mere designations, and for him, that does not

17:06.600 --> 17:10.360
stand for the actual sense of self.

17:10.360 --> 17:14.200
This question came out yesterday, you were down there, right?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.200
That was yesterday?

17:15.200 --> 17:22.200
And then before, you mentioned thoughts, or your thoughts are external, and that's why

17:22.200 --> 17:26.720
people could potentially read your thoughts if they have that power.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.720
Yeah.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.400
And so that got me thinking like how did that do?

17:30.400 --> 17:31.400
Yeah.

17:31.400 --> 17:35.560
So that means basically that thoughts that are internal, for somebody who has developed

17:35.560 --> 17:40.760
their mind, become just less external than things that are externally external for

17:40.760 --> 17:41.760
everyone.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.480
So that's what I mean.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.760
Those thoughts don't change from the internal domain where they are, they don't go out

17:48.760 --> 17:51.160
into the external where everybody can see them.

17:51.160 --> 17:55.560
They stay where they are, but what changes is the mind in regard to these domains.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.360
And then you can see other people's thoughts.

17:57.360 --> 18:01.800
They are not aware of it, obviously, because for them, it's gripped by the whole pile-up

18:01.800 --> 18:06.360
of internal mind, they mention, which they just regard, it's hidden, but it's actually

18:06.360 --> 18:12.880
out there, and it can be seen from the way they would speak, act, behave, all of these

18:12.880 --> 18:19.120
thoughts as possibilities become as external to somebody whose mind has been developing

18:19.120 --> 18:20.120
regard to both the minds.

18:20.120 --> 18:24.120
They're just part of the mind, and I'm a real part of the conscious of it, yeah, yeah,

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
of course.

18:25.120 --> 18:30.520
But it seems that the idea of them being internal comes because they're in my brain.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.520
Exactly.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.520
They're placed in it.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.960
And that's exactly, you look at the phone, the bubble, and there's nothing you can

18:35.960 --> 18:36.960
place in it.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.560
It has a reason and such, and it will go.

18:40.560 --> 18:44.680
Same goes for every single organ, every single part of your body, that's exactly it.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.880
There has no substance.

18:46.880 --> 18:51.960
Nothing can be placed in it, there is substantial.

18:51.960 --> 18:57.880
So that's why people need to keep wondering on this, to stop associating any notions of

18:57.880 --> 19:03.720
my, as in me, in this brain, in this body, in this consciousness, is in here.

19:03.720 --> 19:09.040
No, these things are inaccessible for any such placements, they're mere bubbles, and

19:09.040 --> 19:14.280
there's nothing to them, but they're still phenomenal.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.240
As such, exactly, yeah.

19:16.240 --> 19:21.800
Which is why people get confused, that's why they can maintain this misconception, because

19:21.800 --> 19:40.040
these things keep arise, and the misconception keeps existing, because nobody undoes it.

19:40.040 --> 19:47.360
Now the Rupa, in name and form number, that's still external form, because name and form

19:47.360 --> 19:49.840
with time is not that internal sense.

19:49.840 --> 20:04.920
Yeah, it's not that particular Rupa, because of which, there are certain matters, there

20:04.920 --> 20:11.240
is certain matter around the domain of matter, because of which there is the arising of

20:11.240 --> 20:16.880
sites, sounds, smell, add your eyes, your tongue, your ears, when consciousness is there,

20:16.880 --> 20:21.680
that's supposed to be that matter, and that whole relationship, procedurally, you can't

20:21.680 --> 20:27.760
even access it in your thoughts or abstraction, because you need, only through like that negative

20:27.760 --> 20:35.560
direction of discernment, which is what discernment is, because you need a form, the eye working

20:35.560 --> 20:47.640
and a form, you can't just have one or the other, you mentioned also in previous thoughts,

20:47.640 --> 20:57.440
this idea of time-justice being external, with the object, with that form, with the

20:57.440 --> 21:06.320
material aspect of the object, not with the actual object, because the object is the result

21:06.320 --> 21:09.520
of consciousness and form, already being there just opposed.

21:09.520 --> 21:14.360
Right, my experience of an object is different from the material of an object.

21:14.360 --> 21:21.520
Well you can't say that, because that comparison will apply you somehow accessing the relationship

21:21.520 --> 21:25.560
between consciousness and the object, and then inferring the different, but saying that

21:25.560 --> 21:29.040
it's the same, it's irritable, it's the same, it's the same, it's the same, different,

21:29.040 --> 21:32.600
both same and different, not the same or different, makes no sense, because all of those,

21:32.600 --> 21:37.320
either of those would require you accessing that, which you can't.

21:37.320 --> 21:41.400
Thus people maintain notions that this is the same, or this is what the matter is, or

21:41.400 --> 21:45.080
this is different from matter, or this is in the matter, or matter is in it, all of

21:45.080 --> 21:50.640
those things are conceivings, why, because you can't have the second part of that relationship

21:50.640 --> 21:56.360
of which you would need to have access in order to make all of these conceivings.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.840
And that's where they're wrong.

21:57.840 --> 22:02.360
Even if, say, miraculously, they correspond to how things are, that doesn't matter, because

22:02.360 --> 22:07.040
you can't know, you can't access how things are, thus you're conceiving them to be in

22:07.040 --> 22:10.040
a certain way, will always be a misrepresentation.

22:10.040 --> 22:21.360
It's interesting to think about the idea of accessibility, in case it's not being accessible,

22:21.360 --> 22:22.360
not something you...

22:22.360 --> 22:27.560
Not accessible, but there, but there, you know, and you don't exit, you stop trying to

22:27.560 --> 22:36.080
concede the access, when a designation there does not move towards it, so to speak, in

22:36.080 --> 22:39.760
any direction, does not try to access it, even by implication.

22:39.760 --> 22:44.520
When the mind is fully developed in regard to it, then it stops being a conceiving of

22:44.520 --> 22:47.840
that, because of which, the mind is there in the first place.

22:47.840 --> 22:52.280
So it's like, taking up what's not accessible, trying to...

22:52.280 --> 22:58.920
Yes, that's what conceiving is, taking up, just by leaning too much, or leaning a bit

22:58.920 --> 23:04.440
away from it, or assuming that it's in, out, both in and out, neither in or out, assuming

23:04.440 --> 23:08.640
that it's onward, assuming that it's accessible.

23:08.640 --> 23:13.120
That's why the Mola Pariah is so, that is, and it goes around all of the different

23:13.120 --> 23:18.520
objects, you really come to us, why, because it's not what you are conceiving, it's the

23:18.520 --> 23:24.240
actual attitude of conceiving, that that's the problem, that's the root of the problem.

23:24.240 --> 23:32.960
So it's important then to realize that the object being there comes prior to whatever assumptions

23:32.960 --> 23:33.960
you could make of it.

23:33.960 --> 23:37.200
Well, structurally prior, not temporarily prior.

23:37.200 --> 23:43.640
So it's simultaneously present, but it structurally precedes it.

23:43.640 --> 23:49.280
The structure of movement, the notion of movement is preceded by it, so you can't then

23:49.280 --> 24:17.800
access it as a result of that, the structure of space is one, and time.

24:17.800 --> 24:29.840
That's why the Mola Pariah is so, that's why the Mola Pariah is so, that's why the
