1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,400
There's loads of questions anyway, but I'll start with this Anapanasan Suta, 118, when it says

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:25,680
the fulfillment of the four foundations of mindfulness, when you do breathing, it says

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,300
you're on that occasion, the big fibides contemplating the body as a body, I didn't fully

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,440
aware of my thought, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. I said that this is

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:54,080
a certain body among the bodies, namely in our breathing. So I say that is a certain

6
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:04,000
body among the bodies. Yeah there's quite a quite a bit of a debate over that translation.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,800
I don't know if I'm a big body and then I think the other one I thought he was referring

8
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,280
to it as a body in and out breath and another say well no it refers to the whole body, so

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:28,160
the whole body breathing, so it was never clear just looking at the body, but in terms of

10
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:36,480
the practice of the mindfulness of breathing, I think maybe I didn't, but I think I mentioned

11
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:48,800
that in the notation, maybe you don't get that, you didn't have that part. Well the mindfulness,

12
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,520
yeah the mindfulness of the in and out breath in and out breathing is inseparable from the body,

13
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,120
it is bodily, it's bound with the body, so one doesn't occur with the other, you cannot possibly

14
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,520
conceive in and out breath of breathing without conceiving the body, and same body means breathing.

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,520
When you're mindful of in and out breath then that which is the body there at that time

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,640
is one among the ways of experiencing the body. Body among all the possibilities you can

17
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,880
experience your body, familiar out familiar, far near, heavier lights, whatever, this is one of them.

18
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,560
Well the body of, the way the body is experienced while breathing, while being mindful of breathing,

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,840
not just like while breathing.

20
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:58,800
I don't have time to refine my vision of the body.

21
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,880
Well yeah that's because you're expecting to find something hidden there, so you need to like

22
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:14,080
sharpen your binoculars to really see the details. That is true only to a certain extent,

23
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,280
it doesn't really work like that. Like sharpening the image means like clearing the vision,

24
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,400
as you say it means just finding more details about it, but you can find as many details as you like,

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,800
if you have no sight of the nature of that thing, which is on a general level, no details will help you.

26
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:45,520
So again, what do you expect, what do you hope, what do you crave for, you find,

27
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,480
when you look at the body, when you want to look at it even closer, why, why, what's that?

28
00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:02,560
I don't know what I expect, if I say yeah, I want it okay, I'm going to look mindful of the body now. Why?

29
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
Why?

30
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,680
Well to become dispassionate towards it. Why?

31
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,880
Why? To be passionate towards it. No, why? Why? Why is that a goal?

32
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,080
Why is dispassion good?

33
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:41,120
Wow, is that obvious? No, say it, it's obvious, say it. Well it would be to be free from that passion

34
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,360
or what, depression, covetousness and grief of the world. So what are those covetousness, grief in

35
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,520
the world and everything having common? No suffering, suffering here. So the whole point is to be

36
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,800
free from suffering, but if you're attempts to look at the body closer and closer and closer,

37
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,120
are frustrating when making your suffer, then you are contradicting the whole purpose.

38
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,600
So yes, we agree, mindfulness of the body will bring freedom from suffering, but you have to find

39
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,280
out how, not just do it blindly. And yes, we agree, not being mindful and not keeping the

40
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,200
preset who certainly result in pain and suffering, and just obvious. But when it comes to,

41
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,320
because you are doing the suffering, the suffering is not hidden behind some,

42
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,880
some distant, I don't know, stones that you have to all turn up and look underneath and find

43
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,480
what's there. You are doing it. So once you place yourself in certain amount of

44
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,640
containment through precincts and kind of okay, our practice and making the effort,

45
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,600
well now within that you actually have to sometimes turn around and look at what you're doing

46
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,960
within that, not just keep going and looking out to find the cause of the suffering,

47
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,520
because craving is done, you're responsible for it, and craving is the absolutely only direct,

48
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,280
well it's the direct and absolutely only cause for duka. Craving means presence of duka,

49
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,280
absence of craving is absence of duka, simultaneously, no time lapse in between,

50
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,040
it's simultaneously rising, simultaneously ceasing. So whenever there is suffering in regard to

51
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:42,160
absolutely anything, even if it's your meditation, means craving is there. So initially,

52
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,720
certain amount of suffering is inevitable. When you put that container, the craving is still there,

53
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,200
so you will suffer. But if you just keep taking that for granted, you'll never recognize the

54
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,800
phone over truth. So after a while within that container, you have to start saying okay,

55
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,840
this is nothing, I'm not doing anything on the whole soon, so why am I still suffering within that?

56
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,560
When you recognize that the craving is that dark, the direct clean is generating suffering,

57
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,240
you stop doing it, and then you'll know how to meditate and everything else. And by the way,

58
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:28,000
Anapanasad is taught to at least so to punish. So as many as you shouldn't be trying it,

59
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,840
because through trying that, you can come to understand these things I'm talking about, but

60
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,320
you have to know that what is the, well you have to keep a goal in mind, because it's so easy

61
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,640
to become, when it comes to meditation, everything, and obviously, because all of the

62
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,640
contemporary interpretations and techniques and stages and attachments or whatever else they talk

63
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,920
about, you kind of are always led to expect something, even you can sit, you expect something,

64
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,200
I expect peace from meditation, I expect this, I expect that. And expecting something,

65
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,800
it's like waiting for something, doing it in order for something to arise, and that's exactly

66
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,080
the type of wrong meditation that would have condemned. In that sort of way, he said, you're like

67
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,640
among primeditists or meditists, under meditists, mismetitists, just as a aina,

68
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,760
like waiting in front of a rabbit hole or as a stalk, like waiting for the fish, just waiting,

69
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,280
waiting, like focusing just on one point, looking for other animals of prey, in the same sense,

70
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,440
among sits and like waiting for something to happen to his mind. And that's, that's basically

71
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:49,040
meditation today, that's what it's called as meditation, all of this arises, and even if it's not

72
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,960
explicitly defined, you will inevitably imply that that expectation, that expectation will be

73
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,800
implied in whatever meditation you do, or whatever meditation technique, whatever. One thing they all

74
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,560
have in common is none of them will teach you in the standing, because there isn't any,

75
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,400
the teacher technique, you'll teach a type of prime, prime, prime, no,

76
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
prime, type of praying upon something. Yeah, you pray upon something.

77
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,400
So that's what it comes down to, yeah, whether it's this we pass on that, you're just praying

78
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,960
upon time, then you have this old woman feelings or whatever, oh yeah, you've got it in the

79
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,760
rows or whatever, but that's all just like, you know, you tickle your foot, it will start to

80
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,840
itch. You do this if you result in that, it's absolutely means nothing in terms of understanding,

81
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,960
it's irrelevant. But once you have the understanding, even if you do meditation, you'll be doing

82
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,920
it rightly, whichever meditation you do, because you'll be doing it through the right view,

83
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,760
I, in from the perspective of craving, and not craving, and I'll generate more craving,

84
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,600
and I'll be dependent upon craving expectations. In other words, you'll be standing yourself in

85
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,760
further, in the path of non-suffering that you ordered and disturbed. Because you know that it's

86
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,920
suffering. Because you know how suffering rises, you know how suffering ceases, so whatever you do,

87
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:31,520
you'll be doing it for a cessation that's suffering. Because when I was saved by a focus on

88
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:45,600
that birth elements and seeing the earth element, just, it's just the earth element. There's nothing

89
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,160
more that can be expected from it. It's quite, you know, in my experience, like, I say, I

90
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:01,200
established mine in there. It's not, I feel like, this is just the earth element and establishing mine

91
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,160
in that place. There's nothing more that I can expect. One thing that you can't develop then,

92
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,560
but that thing does not, it's not, cannot be done through craving. So yeah, there won't be

93
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:22,240
an expectation. There won't be any craving when you establish your mine in there, or never. But what

94
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:31,440
you can do then is keep developing, practicing mindfulness in regard to the established mine upon

95
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,320
earth. You know what? I mean, like, hold it in your mind for as long as you can as they do in

96
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,080
those repassionate centers or whatever else. But be aware of its persisting or changing of the

97
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,320
reason thing, which is establishment upon earth. Oh, yeah, there's nothing to expect here. The

98
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,320
thing is still present. And it's still present. And it's still present. And it's still present.

99
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,800
Not equally present. Other things start arising, but don't lose the sight of that establishment

100
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,080
which starts to act as a reference point. It's there while other things are arising. So then

101
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,600
you're really experiencing things through that foundation, foundation of mindfulness, which is

102
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,200
why they're called foundations or references or whatever else you translate it. And then you will

103
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,760
see that whatever that thing upon which you establish will eventually come to fade. And then you

104
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:31,360
are aware that you know you see arising and ceasing. It's arising and its cessation. As I said

105
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,640
before, arising is like ascension. Sessation is like descent. So it's through arising,

106
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,280
persisting or changing is manifestant. Through ceasing, persisting or changing is manifestant.

107
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,040
That's why three characteristics. But they're not linear characteristics as they are translated

108
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,600
or usually written down. So it's arising while persisting while persisting and changing.

109
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,360
And it's ceasing while persisting and changing. Fading in, fading out. The identity of the same thing

110
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,000
remains. But in a way it's not the same thing because it's intensity varies, varies, changes.

111
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,400
And then another thing has a reason. But the thing is with the establishment upon such a general

112
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,400
phenomenon such as earth or any other casino, you can just maintain that mindfulness throughout

113
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,080
in regard to anything because anything that arises on the particular earth has the element of earth

114
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,720
in it. And the sublime, the most supreme of them all, consider consciousness. Imagine that. Anything

115
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,720
that arises implies presence. Anything, no matter how subtle, how quick, how slow, you establish

116
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,440
upon the phenomenon of presence of anything. You mindfulness cannot lapse because it's actually

117
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:54,080
maintained through the particular arising of various irrelevant things. Is that establishing

118
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,960
a mind on infinite consciousness without being the same thing? Because then it does seem

119
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:06,400
but easy, easier. Because if you establish a mind of presence. Oh yeah, well yeah, well, I don't

120
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,440
mean presence in a tree hugging, new age. I mean presence, phenomenological presence.

121
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,320
It's a present of a thing. Whatever it's in front of you, I think that it is present.

122
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,640
So within that, it's in front of you. You can be even more mindful and more established

123
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,040
upon something more general. So you can get yourself upon the earth. So the element of earth

124
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,920
is present through other things. It's quite supreme in regard to everything. But then there is more

125
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:37,200
supreme in regard to the element of earth. And fun, unoptimately, it's the consciousness.

126
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,320
It's the most supreme, the most refined thing. But you don't have to go that far. Because it's

127
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,080
that reference point that matters. Because that's what gets to me in a way. As well, I suppose

128
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:55,760
it's my craving, because I try to establish my own earth and then there's also water.

129
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,520
And there's also fire. How about some air? How about some diversity?

130
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,200
Well, that's the thing when that starts happening. It means you are not really established

131
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,600
upon the element of earth because you lost it so quickly. But if you were established,

132
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,760
if your mindfulness was setting it, then when those other cravings start coming up,

133
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,240
you see them through this reference point, which you won't lose.

134
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,880
And then if you start feeling, oh, what if I start losing this reference point,

135
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,280
you see that through the reference point of earth. Because it is within that already.

136
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,560
And that's how understanding comes. Through practicing that while, remember I was

137
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,800
emphasis in that before. That's a practice of mindfulness. While two things simultaneously present,

138
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,240
you become aware of that principle. So if you do that long enough, you realize that

139
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,640
the understanding will come. Even if you don't go around experiencing every individual thing that

140
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,960
can arise while you're established upon the element of earth, you do that to a certain extent.

141
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,440
But after a while, it becomes apparent. You understand, you see through it, and you realize that

142
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,520
whatever has a reason, whatever will arise, whatever is rising now, will remain

143
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,160
inferior to the element of earth upon which I'm established. So that's how that understanding

144
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,480
kind of compensates, deals with it, fills up whatever else experience you were lacking in terms of

145
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,000
in terms of insight. But sometimes you need to go through these motions more before the

146
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,520
understanding occurs. But full, full, eventually it should occur. And when it does, then you will

147
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,120
stop chasing particular things and stop being concerned about them. Because you understood,

148
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,400
whatever comes in, whatever goes out has to come to you at this point.

149
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,200
And that's what matters. It doesn't matter if the particular thing never matters.

150
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,080
It was that relationship that you were not aware of. It hasn't been understood,

151
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,640
which was inducing all sorts of emotions and cravings and feelings and confusions and five

152
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:04,400
engines. Yeah, I'll experience breathing, experiencing rapture. I say that this is a certain feeling

153
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:12,080
among feelings, namely giving close attention to giving it out of breathing, a certain feeling amongst

154
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,880
feelings. Well, given close attention, I'm like we have to really look into a pile in there.

155
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,640
See the translation, but anyway, I can still answer it. The whole point, the whole point, say,

156
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,400
say you understood the craving, you saw the phone over the truth. So you are at least a

157
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:40,560
soda partner. You practice mindfulness of breathing. So breathing is bodily.

158
00:17:40,560 --> 00:18:01,600
It's intentional act that belongs to the body. So with the lack, with the lack of mindfulness

159
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:12,000
and with the lack of knowledge, that bodily act is appropriated, either through I am reading

160
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,480
forcefully or voluntarily or through complete ignorance of that breathing whereby you think

161
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,000
it's completely automatic. So you obscure the fact that it is intentional.

162
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:35,200
But if you don't do either, you can actually come to see that breathing is an intentional act

163
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:44,240
being done right here that doesn't belong to you. And there isn't anything more you can ask for

164
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,600
in terms of meditation, object in the letter comments. You have an act being done right here,

165
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,000
right now, intentional act, not involuntary like a heartbeat or something like that.

166
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,200
Yet it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the body. You become established in that, then

167
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,440
that body there will be one among the bodies which you are experiencing. But it will be the body that

168
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,600
matters, it will be the body that is not yours. That feeling there, looking at that type of

169
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,480
intentional breathing that doesn't belong to you, that feeling you have there at that time in

170
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,800
regard to that will be one among feelings that you can experience, but it will be the one that

171
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,400
matters because it will be feeling that it is not yours. That intention there and goes

172
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,120
same for what we have against. So that's why it will have to be done properly with the right

173
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,320
view, it will have to culminate in the full development of the enlightenment factors, the four

174
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,040
powers and then the enlightenment factors. Because it will just reveal the whole thing as it is.

175
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,160
But it has to come through that, that's why you said I am breathing in like this,

176
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,280
like as if you're doing it, you start doing it just to become a parent it, yes you are doing it

177
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:17,200
and that whole thing is not yours, it's bodily. So everything remains the same so to speak,

178
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:25,200
just the emphasis of I am breathing, bodily intention shifts onto the body. So I am breathing

179
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:32,400
bodily intention, but now it's resting on the body. So even that I am breathing ceases to be yours,

180
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,680
ceases to be mine, ceases to be me. And then you become really established, then you come

181
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,360
breathing in like this, I am breathing in like that, I will be breathing in like this, I will be

182
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,960
breathing like that, I will be feeling this, I will be feeling that I will be doing this, I will be

183
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,000
doing whatever you like because none of it belongs to you. And by practicing it like that,

184
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:08,240
you're just kind of reinforcing that recognition, that it's not yours, because it's just

185
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:16,160
inferior to the whole body. Well yeah, none of it would be there if that body is not there,

186
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:23,680
if that body is not intentional to begin with, if there is no intentionality belonging to the body

187
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,120
in regard to the body, none of this will be visible, but it's just that you appropriate intentionality

188
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,520
because that's mental belongs to the mind and the Buddha said it's much harder, well it's easier

189
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,520
to see body as not yours and get this passion in regards to it and so on in regard to it,

190
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,840
but it's much harder to feel the same towards your mind because it's half-ler, faster, harder to

191
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:57,520
recognize and so on, but mind is inconceivable without the body, there is no consciousness

192
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,920
just opposed to over the body, if it's not paired with it, there wouldn't be number up or

193
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:11,680
the other number up, it just wouldn't exist. So that's why this whole, the elements in body contemplation,

194
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:19,120
just to reveal the subordinate position of the greatest of your thoughts and mind and

195
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:28,400
yeah, the mind comes first in terms of determining things, but the order of form being first structurally

196
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:35,920
cannot ever change, so as an act, for an action, the mind determines it, but structurally speaking,

197
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:43,920
it's all dependent upon this conscious body, matter that is paired with consciousness out there,

198
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,600
conscious matter,

199
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:59,200
is now when you think consciousness you kind of imply it inside of this end of this spectrum

200
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,360
and the matter is out there in the world, actually both consciousness and the matter around

201
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
there in the world, your consciousness is there with your think, that's why you can even,

202
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,120
well that's where you can perceive distances and space, but oh that's why you can think

203
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,880
in terms of space and in terms of distances, because consciousness is already there and it goes

204
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,640
into infinity, that's where you can perceive into infinity, if you're able to reach it.

205
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,200
The idea, just the thought of space will be inconceivable, if consciousness is generally inside of you

206
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,800
or in your head, as opposed to the matter out there, it will be just a perfect linear

207
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:48,400
flat, but it's not, is it one, would you say that it's one presence,

208
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,720
no, it's many different, as many forms as many consciousness, that's the thing,

209
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,080
if it's one then it's mine, if there's six, which one's yours then, and there are six,

210
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:07,680
each domain of the senses has its own consciousness, does each particular, within that you have each

211
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,560
particular consciousness within the same nature of consciousness, that's all those divisions like

212
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,880
618, 108 of feelings of this, that's how it goes, it's not linear, it's not like commenter is

213
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,000
trying to list them all up, yeah, so yes there is, as an aggregate, as a nature of consciousness,

214
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,360
there is consciousness, but in terms of experience there's six domains of your senses,

215
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,320
that's six consciousness, six different consciousness, just recognizing that can be enough for

216
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,240
this passion and abandon the right view, because if there's six simultaneously present the conscious

217
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,320
domains, well none of them, well certainly not all of them can be mine, and if there is no

218
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:57,440
feeling of singularity, like one, me, there is no feeling of self, and master it, because if there's

219
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,080
six, well which one is it then, oh is this one, yeah, but now is the other one, so

220
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,800
the one that you thought it was yours couldn't be yours, because now the other one is in its place,

221
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,120
so there's six, and then within each of those domains of consciousness you have infinite,

222
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:26,320
infinite structure, infinite, infinite direction, you can call it like that,

223
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,880
so when you look at the tree in the distance there, your consciousness is right there,

224
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,600
at that distance, I don't mean like your consciousness is there as if you're here now,

225
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,840
so if you walk there you'll see your consciousness, no, from your orientation right here,

226
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,640
yeah, that distance there, the consciousness is out there, and the extended distance goes,

227
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,560
the extent of the consciousness is just gone, because otherwise you wouldn't even perceive that,

228
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,400
you wouldn't even perceive the color or the difference of everything if it's not manifested there

229
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,160
as it is in the distance, even if that distance that's just perceived by itself, it's already conscious,

230
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,880
consciousness is there, distance is conscious, matter is conscious, you just find it all there,

231
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,920
yeah, and that's the only reason you can actually appropriate it, and that's the only reason

232
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,000
why the other hand should be possible, because if you were not finding it there and appropriating it,

233
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,560
you couldn't free yourself from it, in other words if you were really creating consciousness

234
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,040
and controlling it and directing it, that's it,

235
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,840
really ready, well there is no gap for any movement, it's all sealed, closed, done,

236
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:41,120
and you're stuck, a point being no, there is a mistake going on, which is you don't see that

237
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,160
you already find things already there, you don't see that, that's why you misconceive them,

238
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:57,440
as mine, as my creation, as I'm the master, as myself, and what do you find already there,

239
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:06,560
whatever has the nature of manifesting, even a fleet in thought,

240
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,400
the fact that it has appeared, the fact that you did not, the fact that you just

241
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:23,840
have it appeared to you, means it came on its own, the other way it's open on its own,

242
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,720
same feeling, intention, anything, the fact that it appears, means it did not come from you,

243
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,080
you just met it, meeting of the three is content,

244
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:46,240
so you just met it ignorantly and you assumed you were contacted, it is my aimless,

245
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,760
but if you meet it with that understanding, that is, well yeah, then you're not contacted,

246
00:27:51,760 --> 00:28:00,480
so whatever, whatever manifests, it's already there, given by itself on its own,

247
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,400
you just find it there, which is nothing else than saying, whatever has the nature of arising,

248
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:15,040
has the nature of ceasing, in other words, whatever is manifested, has the nature of manifestation,

249
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:22,160
is in its nature independent of me, and if something is independent of you means it comes and goes,

250
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,800
and you cannot do anything about it, and if something is independent of you, means it is not yours,

251
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,200
doesn't obey you, doesn't listen to you, but you don't, you see that part, default,

252
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,480
I'm seeing that it's, yeah all of these, yeah, limitation of talking about it, it's just one insight,

253
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,920
yeah I see, I do not say that there is, that there is the development of mindfulness,

254
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:14,160
I'm breathing for one who is forgetful, but when you contemplate, I shall breathe in contemplating

255
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:22,400
impermanence, contemplating within which fading away cessation, on that occasion it

256
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,600
bicker by contemplating mind objects as mind objects, having put away covetousness and grief for

257
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:38,400
the world, having seen with wisdom the abandonment of covetousness and grief, he closely looks on with

258
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:52,960
anonymity, that is the occasion of bicker by contemplating mind, yeah that having seen with wisdom

259
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,960
the abandonment, he knows he sees it, it knows, and then the result is in difference,

260
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:08,080
yeah, and he applies to it, establishing your mind on indifference, if you get okay,

261
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,920
yeah that's interesting, yeah, well see the thing is your mind needs to be quite strong already,

262
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,760
you know the established, yeah because those are more refined phenomena,

263
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,880
like stone or something like that, or body or material things, it's easy to relate to,

264
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,520
so that's how most people inevitably will have to start, but yeah if your mind gets established

265
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,200
upon the thought, well you can get established to such a phenomena, so general, so ambiguous,

266
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,120
when you look at it from a daily kind of worldly point of view, just say infinite consciousness,

267
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:57,760
but that is a real phenomena, it is real as such, so if you see at the extent that it's present,

268
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,160
which is very subtle, and you get established upon it, well you'll be quite skilled in mind

269
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:11,280
establishments, in genres and everything else, or even further neither perception or no perception,

270
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:17,840
yeah, and ultimately cessation of perception and feeling, you get established in that state,

271
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:27,760
but see now when you think about it, infinite consciousness, that thought is in a way that

272
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,520
which infinite consciousness is, because all you have is your own experience, obviously your mind

273
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,840
is not trained in regard to that phenomenon, but if you keep dwelling on it long enough,

274
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,960
accurately, mindfully, it will become more and more accurate in terms of when you think infinite

275
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,720
consciousness, it will more and more start to stand for that which infinite consciousness really is,

276
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:03,280
so as I said before, no matter how abstract thought is, it's abstract only in relation to its

277
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:14,960
content, in itself it is very real, because usually abstract means you dismiss it,

278
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,560
because it's not real, but the nature of abstraction is very real,

279
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,800
you have the word in the book, you think, yeah, so there is already some significant, the fact

280
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,520
that you can designate it, even as an ambiguous abstract term, means there is some significance good,

281
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,360
means, well, it is experienced in such way,

282
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:53,200
so you might think infinite consciousness in relation to this present body right here on this chair,

283
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,880
and in a way you can become established upon that, then after a while,

284
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,680
you will become apparent that what you established is your thought of what infinite consciousness is

285
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,120
in regard to this body there, and that's also fine, it's not a mistake, it's just that now,

286
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,040
you can see well actually, if infinite consciousness is what the sutra say infinite consciousness is,

287
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:23,200
then there is infinite consciousness in regard to my thought too, now just in regard to the body there,

288
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,400
so you have infinite consciousness in regard to your thought of what infinite consciousness is,

289
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,280
and that is really such, but see it's much subtler now already,

290
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,360
but nevertheless, if your mind gets skilled in phenomena, then dama,

291
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,120
you just start seeing these things from what they are, to the extended appear, you see them to

292
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,080
the extended appear, you want to be overcompensating through ignorance, or you won't be ignoring them through

293
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,920
ignorance, you will see them for what they are, to the extent that they have a reason,

294
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,680
so if the general thing you see is general things, but if you see the particular thing,

295
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,960
you won't be making general into particular particular into general how do you confuse it,

296
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,800
and overattending or underattending or misattending or whatever else,

297
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,960
the only somanasikara means that, means having attention that doesn't really

298
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:30,000
that sees the way it has a reason, at its root, at its origin,

299
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:45,440
and it's about a super putting with seeing things,

300
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,520
yeah that's another stem see, a super, like now you can say a super, it can be an abstract term,

301
00:34:51,520 --> 00:35:03,120
but again, the fact that you were able to designate it even in such vague terms, it is real as such,

302
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,760
so then you start dwelling on it, and if you dwell on it you might start seeing more of it,

303
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,960
and then you might understand the nature, the point being that's why again we spoke earlier,

304
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,440
learning comes first, you need to learn, you need to know what you're supposed to look for, what, how to

305
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,880
look for, because otherwise you can't, things won't show themselves, show you the truth by themselves,

306
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,280
and you didn't, wouldn't need the Buddha, any spiritual teaching would do, because that's all they say,

307
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,200
so you need to know what to look for, so once you find out what to look for, you start looking for,

308
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:48,880
so in terms of a super you need to know to look for the aspect of ugly or non-beautiful, in everything,

309
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:57,920
why, because it is there, beauty is sort of, it's relevant, sorry it's relative, in the same sense

310
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,880
that ugliness is relative, it's ugly only relation to something that is less ugly,

311
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:11,280
but see, now because we get so dependent and attached and infatuated by beauty,

312
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,920
you think in terms of beauty, so if it's something ugly, you know, you really, you might say ugly,

313
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,680
but for you it really means it's less beautiful, oh it's really not beautiful, but beautiful is

314
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,800
the reference you think through, and for as long as you think through the reference you're

315
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,520
maintaining your central dependence, but view of centrality really, craving for centrality,

316
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,200
emotional beauty, yeah, you see it brings to beauty, yeah, so even if you're not seeing any

317
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,360
beautiful objects, you still see them through the beauty if you're unestablished, so they'll

318
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:52,960
just see in this less beautiful, so what you need to do is reverse that because it's possible,

319
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,720
because again you can attend it either way, there is absolutely no reason to attend it is beautiful,

320
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,880
no more justified reason, the only reason is your ignorance, so you start overriding that,

321
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,760
you start overriding your ignorance, because there is the aspect of repulsive in everything,

322
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,840
and what is that aspect, it's the very fact that those things are completely indifferent towards

323
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:23,920
you, independent of you, and that's quite, well especially if you're infatuated, that is quite

324
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,040
not nice, cold, but then you change that, and you start looking at everything like that,

325
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,240
and then things that seemingly give care for you, you can just see them as, oh slightly less

326
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:43,120
independent, but still see them through that ugly aspect, so the infatuation, the criteria of

327
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:53,520
beauty, this is to be the motivator for your action, because everything can be attended beautifully,

328
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,320
or non-beautiful, out of habit, you attend everything beautiful, even ugly things,

329
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,400
so that's what it means, you become really skilled in seeing through that dependence,

330
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,520
which is what it's meant in those situations, because it says he sees a beautiful, ugly,

331
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,480
ugly is beautiful, beautiful is beautiful, ugly is ugly, he can do any either way, his mind is

332
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:23,360
developed, yes ugly, so if you're seeing things as ugly, like even beautiful would be just less

333
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,520
ugly, still ugly, shit, you're a really bad smelling shit, and slightly less smelling shit,

334
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,600
but it's still equally a shit, like you wouldn't go and grab a shit because it smells less,

335
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:44,560
it's still a shit, vice versa, if you keep seeing it as beautiful, you will go to a very ugly thing

336
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,240
out of despair, and just recognize it as a beautiful attractive aspect and go for it,

337
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,080
you know when there are no beautiful women around, well you take what you can get,

338
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,280
so the standards drop, if you're in prison, you go after men with resembles women,

339
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,480
or not even that, again all through seeing things, like not being able to break free from

340
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,720
dependence, craving for beauty, but when you reckon it's beautiful and start seeing it as ugly,

341
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,680
you will eventually, you won't happen overnight, because it's, you know,

342
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,520
deeply rooted habit, essentially, but it will fade out because you're not maintaining it,

343
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,200
it needs maintenance, so if instead of beautiful and less beautiful, you start seeing

344
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:43,600
it less ugly and ugly, you will get dispassionate, as well as the looking at pictures or something.

345
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,280
Well it gives you initials per, but if you don't recognize what the actual purpose and the point

346
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,080
of the whole thing is, you can be based in your walls with the super images, it's not going to

347
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,520
do anything, well after a while you're probably still getting attracted to, oh well yeah,

348
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,640
it might be mutilated corpse, but look at the breast on it, yeah, yeah, you need to see the ugly.

349
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,960
If you establish your mind upon the ugly, however, you can have the most gorgeous naked woman

350
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,680
right in front of you inviting you, and you will generally not want to, you will be repelled by it,

351
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,960
why? Because it is generally repelling,

352
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:34,800
it's actually ugly is more fundamental, more structurally, more primordial than beautiful,

353
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,800
beautiful requires attraction, and then you start seeing ugly is beautiful, you get infiltrated,

354
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:49,840
ugly doesn't require anything, doesn't require passion to work, which is again why sensuality is

355
00:40:49,840 --> 00:41:03,760
possible to bring fever. You, beauty requires attraction, requires

356
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:43,120
attraction, there's even a, I do not delight even, or even a little bit of being,

357
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:50,080
like I do not delight in the due to the feces, yeah, yeah, why? Because even like a fingernail

358
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,240
amount of shit, it's still shit, smells like shit, looks like shit, feels tasty, tastes like shit as well,

359
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:12,240
but everything, everything, everything that exists,

360
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,280
all these independence, everything that manifests, why?

361
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:29,920
For the reason that it has manifested itself, so basically the, how to put it,

362
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,640
the way out, like the key to freedom, is in the fact that you're being imprisoned,

363
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,920
it's right there, the fact that you're imprisoned means you can be free,

364
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:53,040
so the fact that things arise, and you take them as my, and they imprison you, they'll wake you,

365
00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:00,160
means that they're not yours to begin with, which means, yeah, you can escape,

366
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:09,200
exactly, from their imprisonment, so the proof in things and permanence is in its manifesting

367
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,800
permanence, because that permanence is manifested itself by itself on its own,

368
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,000
you're nothing to do with it, means, oh, this is impermanence,

369
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,480
for that very reason it will, for the reason that it has manifested itself,

370
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:33,120
for that very reason it will have to cease, nothing else, so its manifestation is its end,

371
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,480
and shows that end is implicit, there's nothing to do with it,

372
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,920
that someone could fall, has to go further as well, maybe to think, like I said,

373
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,680
I'm free from this, no, I'm free from prison,

374
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:04,480
to notice that freedom, so, yeah, well, people can reduce that, they can get a claim,

375
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,400
so they can read something, oh, we're already free or something, but then you have to be self-transparent,

376
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,520
so you can say, oh, yes, unfree, but then, okay, well, can the suffering still arise?

377
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,080
So you just, you just bring in another question in criteria, and put two and two together,

378
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,640
because according to this teaching, that show me the glimpse of this impermanence,

379
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,880
being free means free from suffering, so now I know honestly, if I ask myself,

380
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,320
can the suffering arise for me, in any form, any shape whatsoever, in the future or whatever,

381
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,000
can it, can it do so, if you see, yes, I'm not really free,

382
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,000
but not free to the, to the sufficient extent, to say, I'm free,

383
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,920
am I worried about something? Exactly, so, oh, so even if you say, yeah, but still you're free,

384
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,160
well, okay, what's the point of this freedom, if I'm not free from suffering, because that's a

385
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,760
whole point of freedom, being free from pain, being free from, prospect of pain, yeah,

386
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,560
well, here now, in regard to the future or whatever, so, as I said, remember when I told you that,

387
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,080
when I read that, now I can't remember saying, oh, well, you're already the all-sot upon us, when I was

388
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,360
learning that I did so, actually, wow, so I'm already sot upon it, but then at the same time, I thought,

389
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,040
well, okay, even if that is true, what difference does it make? If my amount of suffering has

390
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,880
not changed, or my amount of being liable to suffering has not changed, what's the point,

391
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:41,120
even if I call myself another, there's no point, unless obviously I practice it for the wrong reasons,

392
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,600
but if you practice it generally for the freedom from suffering, then becomes the only measure

393
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,760
only criteria you care about, and only criteria you should be care about, because that's what the

394
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,400
Buddha said himself, only two things, suffering and freedom from it, that's the sole purpose, sole

395
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:06,800
pastes, absolutely the only thing that the teachings consider about, nothing else, suffering and freedom

396
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:14,960
from it, so you can think, oh, see, I'm already free, okay, great, how did that affect my suffering,

397
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,200
my liability to suffering? Well, it feels like it might have felt, okay, what, keep doing it then,

398
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,600
it makes no difference whatsoever, keep doing it then,

399
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:37,760
yeah, there you go, yeah, you said the whole point,

400
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:06,800
first of all, the pleasure that comes from janas and being secluded from it, it's not something you

401
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:15,440
can crave for, you can't really conceive it as a feeling, because, no, because the feeling now

402
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,960
implies, well, because the only pleasure you're familiar with, is pleasure of centrality,

403
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:26,480
but if you withdraw yourself from it sufficiently, then you can discover a different type of pleasure,

404
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,280
that it's completely free from underlying tendencies, and that's pleasure of janas,

405
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,960
pleasure of seclusion, pleasure of freedom,

406
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:46,320
because through a soup, you can be noted, you see the obvious, reaches this passion,

407
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,880
reaches the security from passion, and then feels pleasant on account of that,

408
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,000
but that's basically a janas, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm telling you about in janas,

409
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,200
like janas, it's nothing, well, first of all, you see that in Anapanasalti, it's not mentioned

410
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,520
at all, leads to forefootation and mindfulness, leads to forepowers, leads to self-factors

411
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,600
and enlightenment, leads to our nature, no mention of janas, why? because janas are completely

412
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:16,000
different things, it's not like direction, particularly directly, it's a particular way of establishing

413
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,360
yourself as a result of this passion, so whether you reach that this passion through Anapanasalti,

414
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,240
you can establish yourself in janas, sure enough, just to say that, whether you reach that

415
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,200
this passion through looking at a suba, you can establish yourself in janas, whether you reach

416
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,480
that this passion through thinking about what jana is, you can establish yourself in jana,

417
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,240
but this whole nonsense, that all came with this premediting, overmediting, mismediting,

418
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,520
where you expect your crave for things like a hyena looking for a prey, waiting in front of a

419
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:55,680
rabbit hole, and then you have the transcendental feelings and noble play bodily experiences,

420
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,560
and then now I'm going to second jana, third jana, oh yeah, I've seen, I'm going back to first one,

421
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:08,560
say nothing to do with it, absolutely nothing to do with it, I mean it states quite secure from

422
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:18,640
central pleasures, he updresses, he abides, he abides, he enters and abides in that state,

423
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,200
the people are in the bind, no, then the Buddha said whether you'll be walking in that state or

424
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:33,840
talking in that state or sitting in that state or doing it, and he's mind remains established.

425
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,920
Yeah, he's saying the article in the mindfulness of the body suit, it says,

426
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:51,680
he went, when mindfulness is so full, whatever way the water jug, we have a tip, so

427
00:49:51,680 --> 00:50:00,240
it goes, yeah, you just have to direct his mind to jana or whatever, whatever, once, you just

428
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:10,080
have to fill it up, he will go somewhere, and that's how he also people develop supernatural powers

429
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:17,200
in the suit, they don't develop them by kind of doing some special practice, they develop mindfulness

430
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,840
and then it says, if there was an opening, he recognized his previous life, if there's an opening,

431
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:31,920
so if there is another way that this mindfulness can be, this jug full of water can be tipped,

432
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,440
because for some people there is, for some people there is an opening, and there aggregates a

433
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,080
lot of remembrance of more aggregates, some people don't, Sariputta, I was just reading the

434
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:48,160
earlier, nothing, he said he could not, nothing, he couldn't see, not even just for one person

435
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,160
in the future destination, he couldn't remember anything, none of his future lives, none of his previous

436
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:57,440
lives, future destination of people, no deeper job, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, he couldn't

437
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,600
see even a mere goblin, yet he was absolutely the foremost, the marshal of the Dharma, the

438
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:13,200
surface calling, after the Buddha, the most supreme, in development, he says nothing to do it,

439
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,280
it's just like circumstantial, some people can remember, some people can't,

440
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,320
like you have blue eyes, somebody has red eyes, as far as the code to you, if you mindfulness

441
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:33,280
is so full, it will manifest itself, if there is an opening, you don't do anything,

442
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,280
and you see when they kind of acquire the three or four knowledges, previous lives and everything,

443
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,400
they were not doing that, they were committed to the Buddha's instruction, freedom from suffering,

444
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,200
they penetrated the truth, they fully realized, and then the knowledges came,

445
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,360
and then they came, and then that came, as a result of them, fully developed the mindfulness

446
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,960
of the extendacity for the final knowledges,

447
00:51:52,960 --> 00:52:09,280
the signs of, of a sign, don't walk on the grass, is a picture of your absence from that loan,

448
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:17,520
that's nimita, for that sign, so you just, so yeah, for an untrained mind, those nimitas like wow,

449
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,440
revelation, but that doesn't just thoughts, in relation to the reason things that you face to your

450
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:28,160
senses, a super nimita would just be, a super nimita would be exactly that, dwelling upon the

451
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:34,160
thoughts of repulsive in regard to the particular thing, so it's a nimita in regard to it's a sign

452
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:40,800
and feature of a certain thing, you only, that sort of says, when he establish mindfulness, when

453
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,640
things come through his senses, he doesn't give attention to any signs of features, the word is nimita,

454
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:54,400
yeah, so initially when you come across the beautiful sign of features, sex,

455
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,160
yeah, it's restrained of the senses, so that's the first nimita that hits you,

456
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,800
but then you get established upon the repulsive, you're going to have different significance

457
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,280
of that experience, you have different nimitas, you have different signs and tokens,

458
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,280
We are experiencing the meters all the time.

459
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,280
Well, the limit is just like intentionality.

460
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
Thoughts, that's how you operate.

461
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,280
In many examples, the Buddha goes to see the body.

462
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,280
He looks at different parts of it.

463
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,280
But he goes to whatever is started in the body,

464
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,280
like head, his test, his brain.

465
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,280
All those things, all of this in this particular thing,

466
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,280
is just reinforcing this aspect,

467
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,280
the nature of solidity that is present there.

468
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,280
And then you get established in that.

469
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,280
And then, okay, well, then there are these things that are not solid.

470
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,280
So, less solid is water.

471
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,280
So upon that established aspect,

472
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,280
you establish another aspect.

473
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,280
Upon that aspect, you establish another aspect.

474
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Upon that aspect, you establish another aspect.

475
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,280
So, four elements, so you have everything.

476
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Nothing is not covered.

477
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
So it's good, actually.

478
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,280
Well, it's good.

479
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,280
Yeah, for that reason,

480
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
if you expect some magical limiters,

481
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,280
it's not going to happen.

482
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,280
If you are doing it for the utter dispassion

483
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,280
in regard to experience as a whole,

484
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,280
and then you get established upon that,

485
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,280
then yeah, and then limiters will happen.

486
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,280
But they won't be mystical kind of manifestations.

487
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,280
They will be like, ah,

488
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,280
now you start recognizing a significance.

489
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,280
So it seemed manifold, this establishment.

490
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,280
Like earth, then everything solid,

491
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
everything water, everything this.

492
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,280
It seemed like you're doing it.

493
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,280
But after a while, if you keep doing it,

494
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,280
if you keep practicing it,

495
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,280
that dispassion over things,

496
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,280
that becomes a thing.

497
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,280
No matter how manifold was in your doing an intention,

498
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,280
when it's being experienced,

499
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,280
it's experienced as a thing or a thing.

500
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,280
It has its own limiters.

501
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,280
The two recommenders.

502
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,280
So next time you get those limiters,

503
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,280
you get that experience.

504
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,280
You get experience, you get those limiters.

505
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,280
So you start recognizing signs and tokens

506
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,280
to bring back establishment instantly.

507
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,280
So through the establishment, for example,

508
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,280
wandering on the element of earth,

509
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,280
the element of earth,

510
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,280
the more you are established,

511
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,280
the more implications that phenomena will reveal.

512
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,280
So to speak.

513
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,280
In the same sense, the more you dwell on the beautiful,

514
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,280
the more aspect of beautiful you're going to get.

515
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,280
You want to be grateful.

516
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,280
In the same sense, you dwell on the indifferent,

517
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,280
like a quite sublime aspect of the earth casino,

518
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,280
what you're going to get.

519
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,280
You're going to get its own significance of solid,

520
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,280
of everything.

521
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,280
All of those are limiters in relation to their earth.

522
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,280
And all of those things become new ways,

523
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,280
new tokens, new signs,

524
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,280
to bring back establishment of earth.

525
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,280
In the same sense, now I have to say,

526
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,280
woman, and the aspect of beauty is back,

527
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,280
even if you don't see any particular woman.

528
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,280
Why?

529
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,280
Because you are so familiar in skill

530
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,280
in wandering on those aspects.

531
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,280
But later on, it will not be for you to think,

532
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,280
if you establish yourself on casino earth,

533
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,280
you just think solidity,

534
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,280
and you establish upon the element of earth.

535
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,280
Yes, I'm noticing that.

536
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,280
Even if foam, the foam,

537
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,280
it will be like that.

538
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:31,280
And it will be the entry point to that same plant.

539
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,280
That's the whole thing.

540
00:56:33,280 --> 00:57:00,280
That's the whole point.
