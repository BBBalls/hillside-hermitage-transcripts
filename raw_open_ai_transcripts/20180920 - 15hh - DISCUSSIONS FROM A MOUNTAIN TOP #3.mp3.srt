1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I was wondering if you could explain Anata, what is it?

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's non-self, not self.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And what's the point of it? Why do we need to know that experience?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's worth it again.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well I think you can start by explaining what it isn't.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And it is not a denial of self, as in there is not self.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Because usually people would basically hear that, hear the teaching Anata,

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and then end up kind of naturally jumping into an assumption of,

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
so there is no real self, because none of this is real.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But denying the problem doesn't actually solve it.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And especially doesn't work in this case because the sense of self,

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
it's not about some metaphysical mistake.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's about the intuitive sense of ownership of your experience, of your senses.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And because of that ownership, the sense of self is generated.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So the sense of self in people's lives is not a problem,

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
it's a symptom of an underlying problem or ownership.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And if you discern that right order and stop regarding things as mine,

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and by that I mean being emotionally connected to them, because that's the ownership.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's not like you don't care about things that you don't care.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So if something happens to those things, you won't be affected.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So you saying, oh that's not mine, makes no difference.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You want to apply the attitude of not mine onto their personal emotional level,

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
as in you want to apply it onto things that you will be affected by if you lose them.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If they change against your will.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So Anata is the most fundamental principle of Buddhist teaching,

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
refers exactly to that, because there's nothing that you can actually own

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
in a sense of that you would be its master, controller, in charge of.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And I'm going to talk about your life, the most fundamental aspects of your experience.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So your feelings, your perceptions, your intentions are fundamentally given to you basically.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You arise, and because you're not, you don't know any better,

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
you just assume that they're mine, because they're here.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
For me, who else is there is just me.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But that's the problem with ignorance, because there is no first origin of that mistake.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It is a mistake, but there is no first point where that mistake became

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
before which everything was nice and pure.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So that mistake is a starting point, which means you have to accept that there is a mistake.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You have to accept that there is a sense of self, that thinks it owns things.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But then you listen to the Buddhist teaching, you read the suttas,

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and you actually get the sense that it's out of the way around.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's because you own things, you keep redefirming that sense of self,

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
as that independent owner of these things.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But as I said, it's out of the way around.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's because you keep engaging in the act of ownership.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That sense of self is being maintained.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So you stop doing that, and then the anatomy of teaching becomes apparent.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not like there is no self, there is no mistake.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But you undo the mistake of ownership, so then you can truly say,

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
there is not self, as in not my own self.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So that phenomenon of self still remains.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now, it's not mine.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There is no involvement or denial of the sense of self.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's basically accepting it as a reason phenomenon,

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and then undoing the ownership of it.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So you can truly say, anata means that that, which is taken to be myself,

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
it's not mine.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And that experience is the experience of anata.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And another thing is basically, I think you spoke about it before, actually.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know whether it was recorded or not, but

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
all the people would just quote random science or things like that,

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
just to prove that everything is constantly changing,

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
thus nothing is mine.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But that's not anata that the Buddha talks about.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's that personal side of ownership, that emotional connection to it.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So you are not proving any anata if you say,

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
look, this stone over there is comprised of such and such minerals and elements

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and atoms and neutrons and whatever else.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thus it's not really, it's not really real, it's not really mine.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But you don't care about it to begin with, so you're not proving anything.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Because that sense of ownership, it's not an ideology or kind of an abstract idea,

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
it's emotional attitude.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now try explaining the same scientific way to your own daughter,

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
or your son, or your child, your baby,

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
or something you are inherently bound with, emotionally.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then see how indifferent you can remain.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
In fact of your explanation that it's nothing, it is the clump of elements and cells.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's pointless, it's completely, doesn't even apply on the same domain, such explanation,

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
which means people use it only for this ideological purpose to justify the views.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But practically, basically the Buddha's teaching frees you from that emotional dependence,

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
doesn't explain things to you.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So if you think that Anata is this random, everything is constantly changing and nothing is mine,

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
well it isn't, because that doesn't free you from that emotional dependence upon those things.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So you want to basically find things that you are emotionally dependent upon,

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and then start undoing the ownership of them because you see yourself liable to suffering

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
on account of losing them, even if you don't necessarily lose them.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And actually you don't want to wait for them to be gone to see that you're liable to suffering of them being gone.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You want to do it before.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So that's what I mean, Anata refers to that personal attitude of something that's dear to you,

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
something that you are connected with.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And I think, I think the etymology of that word, of the Sanskrit Nitya, as in Nitya.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Sorry?

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Anitya.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well Anitya and Nitya, as in Anitya and it's Sanskrit.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's been a long time ago since I was looking for that, but there are lots of synonyms with that word

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and it can be used basically for a personal internal dear to me, Nitya.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And then basically Anitya would be the opposite of that.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So yes, you can say it's impermanent, but actually it probably doesn't do it justice

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,380
because of, well today's modern contemporary view is what people think

98
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,380
of impermanence, impermanence is this kind of almost impersonal debate of physics,

99
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,380
of how everything is impermanent, everything is constantly changing.

100
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,380
But there's just denial of the existence of the things that you are emotionally bound with.

101
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,380
And that denial can provide people with a relief, with a degree of relief,

102
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,380
which is why they mistake it for some sort of truth, because you deny the problem,

103
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,380
it covers the problem up, but it doesn't solve it, doesn't approach it,

104
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,380
which means sooner or later, well you'll forget about denying it, or something else will point at it,

105
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,380
remind you of it, and you're back the square one, you made no difference.

106
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,380
So that's why you really want to first accept the problem and stop denying it,

107
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,380
and stop finding justification for it.

108
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:14,380
And that can be helped if you think that Nitya and Anitya actually refers to personal and dear,

109
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:22,380
and then not taken personally and not dear to me, as in you're indifferent, emotional equilibrium.

110
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,380
And there's that similarity that the Buddha gives to the monks.

111
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,380
He said, monks people get basically upset, affected by suffering,

112
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,380
when things that they are attached to are gone, are affected.

113
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,380
So they should basically abandon the attachment.

114
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,380
He doesn't say they should basically find the justification for the denial of the existence of those things.

115
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:52,380
And then the simile that he gives is basically when he says they were sitting in the in the in the forest,

116
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,380
and he said, so for example, see all these sticks and branches just lying around here,

117
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
that you are completely indifferent to.

118
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:05,380
Would you be upset if some people come here and start breaking these branches and taking them and burning them?

119
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,380
Of course we wouldn't, why? Because we are completely emotionally indifferent.

120
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
These branches are nothing to me.

121
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,380
He says, well, that's how you should then cultivate the same attitude towards your own body,

122
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,380
towards your own senses, towards your own life.

123
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,380
But he didn't say, that's how you should start dismissing your own body and saying,

124
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,380
well, it's not really real and whatever else.

125
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Because they would just be obscuring the problem.

126
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:36,380
So yes, you won the attitude of completely indifferent,

127
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:43,380
economists in regard to your own existence, your own senses, your own thoughts, basically your own feelings.

128
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,380
But that cannot be done if you keep denying those thoughts and feelings or explaining them

129
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,380
in some sort of ideological terms such as like a scientific take.

130
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,380
Because often people would say, oh yes, the modern science is proving that the Buddha was right.

131
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,380
If the modern science were proving that the Buddha was right,

132
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,380
it means that every modern scientist who takes it at view would be at least a sort of animal.

133
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,380
Or even more.

134
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,380
But the fact that they are not means they don't know what the term is,

135
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,380
so they cannot even accidentally prove it.

136
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,380
And furthermore, science is directly divorced from any phenomenological proof of the Buddha's teaching

137
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,380
because science inherently negates the existence of observer,

138
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,380
of the subject, of the personal point of view.

139
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,380
Science inherently operates under the assumption of a public world independent of all of us,

140
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,380
failing to see that that's the point of view that you are completely bound up with

141
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,380
and you cannot step outside of it.

142
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,380
Which means if you engage in science on account of trying to understand the Buddha's teaching,

143
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,380
or if you engage in a scientific view basically, you're engaging in the view of the denial of the problem

144
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,380
of the personality, personal attachment, craving in regard to your feelings and all of that.

145
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,380
Because then you're just explaining what's happening.

146
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,380
You're not really uprooting it through understanding.

147
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Which is already what Sotopana begins to do.

148
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:14,380
So similar actually to that.

149
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,380
I got a book I wanted to read that bit.

150
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,380
It's quite connected to that whole denial.

151
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,380
It's when people, like the other similes in the suttas where people would say,

152
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:35,380
well this body is made out of various organs and parts that, you know, when they break down,

153
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,380
there won't be any life left, there won't be any body remaining.

154
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,380
Thus there is nothing for me to take there to be mine.

155
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,380
But people, again, it's easy to misread that because the point is subtle.

156
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,380
So people would then think, ah, things that are made out of parts are not real.

157
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,380
So there's the famous, the questions of the King Melinda when he says, well,

158
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,380
it's like having a chariot that is made out of parts.

159
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,380
And if you take the chariot apart, you have all these random parts.

160
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Thus, chariot doesn't really exist.

161
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:17,380
But that argument fails to see that a chariot is already a particular functional assembly of parts.

162
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,380
And if you don't call it chariot, you can call it an assembly of parts.

163
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,380
And that's a completely valid reality and valid truth.

164
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,380
And it was never the problem.

165
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,380
But because the problem is subtle, the problem is not in the things that you own.

166
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,380
It's not in the conventions or your designations.

167
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,380
The problem is in your attitude towards it.

168
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,380
As in attitude of appropriation and assumption.

169
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,380
That's what we said, the five aggregates are not Upadana.

170
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,380
Five aggregates are not assumption and attachment, but there is no attachment without the five aggregates.

171
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,380
But these questions of King Melinda, he actually goes in explaining that see,

172
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,380
five aggregates can actually be broken into parts.

173
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
There is no real person there.

174
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,380
But that is putting the problem of ownership, putting the problem of attachment into the five aggregates

175
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,380
and then destroying the five aggregates, you destroy the problem.

176
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,380
But the Buddha himself said the problem is not in it.

177
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,380
It's in regard to it.

178
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:15,380
Desire you lost in regard to the five aggregates, the attachment to your experience is there.

179
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,380
So that's what I mean like using that kind of argument just obscures the problem.

180
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
Doesn't solve it.

181
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,380
Denial of the reality doesn't solve your attachment to it.

182
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,380
Because then you become attached to the reality of that denial.

183
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,380
And you just obscure it.

184
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,380
When you read in the suttas, when the Buddha would encourage people to investigate, well not investigate,

185
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:43,380
but really contemplate the various parts of your body as in a basis for experiencing a non-attraction and revulsion.

186
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,380
That's basically to undermine your gratuitous notion of Bodhi's beautiful.

187
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Or to undermine your gratuitous notion of you are in control, like you are the master of this body.

188
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:03,380
So in order to practice that contemplation rightly, you need to do it on the basis of that body that has arisen

189
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:09,380
on the basis of that ownership of your body, which means you need to start seeing these parts of the body

190
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,380
within that single unit of the functional arrangement that your body is.

191
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,380
Because by seeing that there are parts of this functional arrangement of the unit of the body that I own,

192
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,380
you can see that actually that ownership is gratuitous.

193
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,380
It's not that that body is not real.

194
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,380
The ownership is gratuitous because this thing that I own, that I think I'm the full master controller,

195
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:39,380
is fully determined by these random things that I can't even access. For example, your beating heart.

196
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Like I see even the expression, my beating heart, you kind of assume the ownership because it belongs to this body that you own.

197
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:53,380
Now you trying to say, oh well see this heart is on its own, operates on its own, if it stops, my life is gone, that's all true.

198
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:01,380
But if you use that argument to say that thus there is really no body there, it's just these parts, well they're just obscuring the issue.

199
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:08,380
Because there is the body there, because otherwise if there is nothing there, how can you even direct your denial at it?

200
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:17,380
It has to be there to some extent. And that extent is the functional arrangement of the body that is actually comprised out of individual independent parts,

201
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,380
not me and my sense of self and my sense of mastery and my control.

202
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,380
So yes, it's mentioned in the suit as often this kind of reflection of various bodily parts,

203
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:38,380
but it needs to be done correctly, needs to be done on the basis of the body, so that then you can remove that which is not necessary in regard to that experience,

204
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:47,380
and that is your own ownership of it. Your gratuitous assumption of mastery of your life, like fundamentally, even like biological, my own heart.

205
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,380
But if it were yours, you would be able to tell it when to beat and how to beat.

206
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:59,380
You wouldn't be completely left out, pushed outside of it. You can't even access the notion of voluntarily controlling your heart.

207
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,380
Yet if that random pumping muscle in your chest stops, your life's gone. That is.

208
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Yet at the same time you maintain the full notion of mastery over your life.

209
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:21,380
So looking at the heart is just, if done correctly, it will approve that gratuitous mastery. It will not deny the reality of your life.

210
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,380
And that's why Arahant, who is fully approved to that, and a light and person is fully approved,

211
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,380
he still operates normally, seemingly from external point of view.

212
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,380
He has intentions, he has choices, he has decisions. All that stays.

213
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:42,380
What he doesn't have is the ownership of the five-aggregate. He doesn't have the ownership of the experience as a whole.

214
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,380
He doesn't own his body, he doesn't own his intentions. It doesn't mean he's...

215
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,380
And the only way to arrive, basically, and that point of not ownership is to first accept it.

216
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:59,380
Hence the accepting of responsibility for your own actions, accepting the validity, basically, of actions, of the results of actions,

217
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,380
of the results of practice needs to be the first step. That's the mundane right view.

218
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,380
But if you keep denying it, as it's not real, you are denying the basis for your practice.

219
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,380
It's very easy to deny the problem. There's no self.

220
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:31,380
That for me is the most natural reaction, which is bound to the most fundamental attitude that the Buddha will describe it.

221
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,380
When there is a pleasure, affirm it further, that's how people react.

222
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,380
When people experience the unpleasant attitude denied, try to get rid of it, remove it.

223
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:48,380
And that's like craving in regard to pleasant, craving in regard to unpleasant.

224
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,380
So in this particular instance, you realize that there is a problem.

225
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:03,380
There is a problem of the gratuitous sense of self that thinks it's a master and owner, yet the experience keeps contradicting it.

226
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Because the suffering, the discrepancy of experiencing suffering, should be enough for an authentic, transparent person to see that actually you are not in control.

227
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,380
And your gratuitous notion of control, it's the reason for your suffering.

228
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,380
You are the one responsible for the discrepancy of your resistance to them results in suffering.

229
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,380
All results in being liable to suffer.

230
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,380
It results in possibility to suffer.

231
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,380
Possibility to be affected by suffering.

232
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,380
And that in itself, recognition of that is what suffering is.

233
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,380
What about seeing yourself directly?

234
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Sorry?

235
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
Seeing yourself directly.

236
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Seeing your sense of self directly when you come, because you'll be seeing it with your sense of self.

237
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,380
As in you'll be appropriating that in the gratuitous sense of mastery over the sense of self.

238
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,380
Which means the sense of self, that's what I said, it's a symptom.

239
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,380
It's not an issue that you can see and then directly address.

240
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,380
It's a symptom caused by, so you have to start looking at it as such.

241
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Because if you blame the symptom for the illness, you're not going to see the illness.

242
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
That undermines it.

243
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
That underlies it, sorry.

244
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:28,380
So you have to recognize that you can't access that sense of self directly because it's done with the notion of self.

245
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Which means your sense of self.

246
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,380
You might think, oh, this is myself.

247
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,380
And that means that you're that gratuitous sense of ownership in regard to that experience.

248
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,380
Is it the background of it?

249
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
It's always elsewhere from where you look.

250
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,380
So you have to stop trying to expect you're going to find it through like looking and spotting where it is.

251
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,380
Because you don't need to.

252
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,380
Once you recognize it's a symptom, okay.

253
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,380
So you stop trying to chase the symptom.

254
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,380
You use it as a criteria whether the illness is still present.

255
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,380
And that illness is the sense of ownership of things that you do have say.

256
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,380
That you can kind of experience and relate to directly.

257
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
Such as I choose centrality.

258
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
I choose ill will.

259
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,380
I choose this or with this because I'm purely acting out of desire for pleasure.

260
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Desire and lust in regard to the five aggregates.

261
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,380
That's what I would describe.

262
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,380
That's why the Upadana and the ultimate Upadana.

263
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,380
The ultimate attachment is the attachment of the self view.

264
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,380
That's just the key picking lady.

265
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380
Stop barking.

266
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,380
The ultimate Upadana is the Upadana of the self view.

267
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,380
And so you maintain basically that symptom.

268
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,380
Because you keep engaging in that which is keeping you sick.

269
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,380
You keep maintaining your desire and lust in regard to your experience.

270
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,380
And that's something that you knowingly do.

271
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,380
So that's the problem with people who kind of are familiar with the Buddhist practice.

272
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,380
They're aware of the sense of self.

273
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,380
They're aware that it's supposed to be seen as not myself as in anata.

274
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,380
But they don't see necessarily the connection.

275
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,380
So then they just keep trying to deny the sense of self.

276
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,380
Trying to like go not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine.

277
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,380
And address it on its own terms.

278
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,380
Bailing to see basically that it's their desire and lust.

279
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,380
They're fully aware in regard to other things throughout their life.

280
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,380
That's the connection that they're missing.

281
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,380
And that's why because of that the whole sense of the sensory strength

282
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,380
and sea lion virtue comes first.

283
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,380
Because you can't possibly not be perpetuating desire and lust in your thoughts.

284
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,380
When your physical actions and verbal actions are fully engaged in it.

285
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,380
You can think your thoughts are pure as much as you want, but they're not.

286
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,380
Because your behavior is still perpetuating that mistake in pattern.

287
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:54,380
So you have to start training it on that level so that then it can become clearly visible on the level of your thought.

288
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,380
So that's what I mean.

289
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,380
You have to see the connection between these things

290
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,380
as in your security sense of ownership is maintained

291
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,380
through your careless giving into the desire, giving into the ill will,

292
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,380
giving into the distraction, giving into the unfals, some states, in your daily experience.

293
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,380
And that's where the practice is.

294
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Being watchful of those things.

295
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,380
Not being watchful of everything and nothing or trying to catch your sense of self

296
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,380
or trying to catch a perfect moment that will reveal that nothing is real,

297
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
that there is no self really.

298
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,380
No, none of that was ever a problem.

299
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,380
The only problem is you engaging in unwholesome.

300
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,380
And that's why it's defined as unwholesome.

301
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Because it keeps, it's a direct determination of the problem of suffering,

302
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,380
of the problem of gratuitous ownership and mastery of your experience.

303
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,380
That's why it's unwholesome.

304
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,380
If it doesn't partake in that, it's not unwholesome.

305
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,380
Which means it's either neutral or it's either wholesome.

306
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Hey.

307
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,380
Shut it.

308
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,380
Shut it.

309
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,380
Go and play the job.

310
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:29,380
He's healthy.

311
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:36,380
So what happens when you no longer own that sense of self?

312
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,380
Well, that's true definition of freedom.

313
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,380
You have basically laid down the burden.

314
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,380
The burden of action, the burden of...

315
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,380
You have laid down the liability to suffer.

316
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,380
He just cannot affect you.

317
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
And that's the direct measure of that freedom.

318
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,380
Inability to suffer, I mean suffering.

319
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,380
That sounds like a kind of madness.

320
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,380
Like somebody who denies...

321
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,380
Well, no.

322
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,380
See, that's what I mean.

323
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,380
That's what I keep saying.

324
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,380
You have to start with non-denial because it will result exactly in that.

325
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,380
People doing all sorts of horrendous things and then saying,

326
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
well, there is really nobody there.

327
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Which was exactly one of the wrong views that the Buddha was criticizing.

328
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,380
Back in the day when, in India, they believed.

329
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,380
And actually, I read that there was in Bhagavad Gita was the whole point of saying,

330
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
nobody, you can go and kill.

331
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,380
You can chop people's heads off.

332
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,380
And nobody gets healed.

333
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,380
Killed is just a sword running through the elements and whatnot.

334
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,380
The Buddha criticizes that as extremely wrong view.

335
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,380
They can result in a lot of suffering for you if you act out of it.

336
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,380
See, that's when you basically jump to a conclusion,

337
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,380
not develop the understanding of the conclusion.

338
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,380
And if you actually look closer to this conclusion, you realize,

339
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,380
okay, in order to understand it, I must stop denying things.

340
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,380
I must accept that human life is a real thing.

341
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,380
A choice is a real thing.

342
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,380
The body, it's a reality as such.

343
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,380
Things appear differently, but they are real.

344
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,380
In whatever manner they appear.

345
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,380
So even a pure abstract thought, it is real as an abstract thought.

346
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,380
That's a definition of phenomenology.

347
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,380
As in basic understanding of phenomena, the standing of appearance.

348
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
But people get a hint of it, maybe.

349
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,380
Ah, there is really no self.

350
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,380
They find their view pleasing without any understanding of it.

351
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
And that's when they develop these conclusions.

352
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,380
Ah, so I can do whatever I want because there is no doer there.

353
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,380
And there is nobody who receives that doing either.

354
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,380
And nobody affected.

355
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,380
And that was exactly the view in the time of the Buddha.

356
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,380
And before, and obviously after, whereby you can say things such as,

357
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,380
no, no, no, it should you to go and kill these people.

358
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
You can go and kill them.

359
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
And nobody gets killed anyway.

360
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,380
We are all already divine and saved and whatnot.

361
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
So that's what I mean.

362
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:01,380
The denial must stop first in order for basis of understanding to arise.

363
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,380
Because how can you understand the ownership of something that you appropriate as yours

364
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,380
if you keep denying that you appropriated anything?

365
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,380
Oh, why are you going to give me back, I don't know.

366
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Those books, I'll end you.

367
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,380
What books?

368
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,380
There are no books.

369
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
Books don't exist.

370
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,380
What are you talking about?

371
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,380
No, you took it.

372
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,380
And in this case, it's even worse because you keep thinking it.

373
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,380
That which is not yours.

374
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,380
You keep regarding it as mine.

375
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,380
So who's the real owner?

376
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,380
Well, the real, the question of a real owner is based on the already that

377
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
misperceived owner that you are.

378
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,380
As in, okay, so if I'm not the owner, who's the real owner?

379
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,380
And that's exactly, again, another view back in India,

380
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,380
that's very prevalent today, the greatest sense of self.

381
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,380
You abandon your sense of self by surrendering it to the greatest sense of self.

382
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,380
But the slightest notion of the sense of self, you can only relate to it

383
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,380
because you're maintaining it on your own self level.

384
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,380
As in, if you abandon your sense of self, truly, if you see this thoroughly

385
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,380
unhonable, so to speak, thoroughly independent of you because it depends upon

386
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,380
things that you cannot even access, let alone control and tell him what to do.

387
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,380
Notion, any extension of that sense of self is seen under the same nature.

388
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,380
Not mine, not for me, not myself.

389
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,380
So if people can conceive and conceive and act out of the greater sense of self

390
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,380
as in God, for example, they do so based on the very personal sense of self.

391
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:37,380
And that's why Sartre meant in the, basically, the most common idea of God

392
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,380
is just the extension.

393
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:44,380
It basically is the ideal of your sense of self, being the ultimate master creator.

394
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,380
Then you project into this outer universe of the great, the great God,

395
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,380
being of God, or whatever, the mystic energy and so on.

396
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,380
All of that is relatable only through your sense of self.

397
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
And that's another thing.

398
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,380
You can either deny your sense of self, try to get rid of it, which fails,

399
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,380
or you can try to envelope it in a greater sense of self, which is just, again,

400
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,380
just extension proliferation of it, which is even worse because it's another way

401
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,380
for executing your own sense of self.

402
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:19,380
Same would be always, it was God's will and so on.

403
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:26,380
You decided, you decided that what you've done was actually rooted in the greater sense of self

404
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,380
because, yeah, truly, intentions arise on their own.

405
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,380
But you are the one who chooses to act upon them.

406
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,380
Intentions present themselves.

407
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,380
You see a cup, you can use it for drinking, you can use it for throwing,

408
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,380
chasing, chasing, chasing, chasing, I don't know, chasing a wild animal.

409
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,380
You can use it for all these sorts of things.

410
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,380
It's an object that has all this intentionality implied in it.

411
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:55,380
But you choose to use it in a certain manner, on account of whatever you're trying to achieve.

412
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,380
But then dismissing the, basically dismissing the reality of the cup

413
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:06,380
or the object you chose to use, you hope to cover up your responsibility for the choice of that thing.

414
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,380
And that's something you can't do.

415
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,380
Or ascribing the intentionality of an object to a greater God

416
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,380
and then saying, well, see, these things were presented to me in all these manner, that's why I used it.

417
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,380
It's not my fault.

418
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,380
Yeah, it's not your fault that things were presented in a manner of options.

419
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:31,380
But it is your fault to choose to act upon it irresponsibly and deny the responsibility or act out of greedy version delusion.

420
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,380
That's what I mean, denial must stop.

421
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,380
Because as long as you deny things, you interfere with that, which is actually not on you.

422
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,380
Arising of the thoughts, arising of the options, arising of the intentions.

423
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,380
But you then choosing to act in a certain manner, on account of this or on account of that, that's on you.

424
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:54,380
And that's why the Buddha would say all he teaches, basically, is suffering in freedom from it

425
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,380
in a sense of by avoiding unwholesome, cultivate the wholesome.

426
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:06,380
Because it's not unwholesome to have a thought of throwing the subject at somebody.

427
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:14,380
But if you then start relishing that thought and thinking upon it further intentionally, now that bit is unwholesome and that's on you.

428
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:21,380
Or even worse, if you choose then to verbally start acting upon it in an abusive manner and then physically start abusing somebody,

429
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:27,380
well, that's of course, that's just the further proliferation of that unwholesome attitude.

430
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,380
So that's what I mean, the responsibility must be taken first.

431
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,380
The denial of things must be basically abandoned.

432
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,380
And then you created the basis for the practice of Dhamma.

433
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,380
And that's why it's a middle way.

434
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,380
Because you don't go and deny everything or affirm everything.

435
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,380
You recognize where the line is, where your responsibility begins and where it ends.

436
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,380
And you start thinking like that, you can make sense out of what Arran is.

437
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:01,380
Because people would often like, what, Arran is this like thoughtless, basically robot who just acts automatically.

438
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:09,380
No, he's just a person who has basically removed any ownership, any appropriation, any interference of things that arise naturally,

439
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,380
which means he's incapable of acting unwholesome.

440
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,380
It doesn't mean that whatever he does or says will be pleasing to people.

441
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:24,380
It means that he cannot be rooted in greater version delusion, cannot be rooted in the wrong view.

442
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,380
Come here boy.

443
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Come here.

444
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,380
Come here boy.

445
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
Hey.

446
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,380
You have trouble?

447
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Focus. Sit.

448
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,380
Good boy. Come here.

449
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,380
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

450
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
You have trouble.

451
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,380
But you're a good girl.

452
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,380
I don't want him to go down there. That fence is fixed.

453
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
You might discover.

454
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:15,380
Boy, you wouldn't.

455
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:51,380
That's when practical terms and ultimately, all a person would need to do really is keep an eye on their own intentions,

456
00:32:51,380 --> 00:33:04,380
motivations, what makes them act, because that's what determines wholesome and wholesome and then how wholesome or how and wholesome can be.

457
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,380
And that's something you cannot not be aware of.

458
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,380
And mindfulness is something you can't have too much of as the Buddha described.

459
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,380
It's also like a rigid, mechanical observation of moment to moment to moment.

460
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,380
No, it's awareness of that which is already present.

461
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,380
Fundamentally, intentions.

462
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Because if you're mindful basically of your body being, you're mindful of your situation that's already intentional.

463
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,380
If you're mindful of your feelings, you're mindful of the situation that's already intentional.

464
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Which means you're then mindful, not necessarily to the full extent.

465
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,380
That's what Buddha said, mindfulness developed to the extent necessary for the final knowledge.

466
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:53,380
But the possibility of you being mindful of it is always there because these things are present.

467
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:01,380
So that means you can actually then discern the background of whatever your situation is, which is already that background is part of it.

468
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,380
You can then discern the subtler motivation behind your actions.

469
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,380
And if you discern it, you will see if it's wholesome or unwholesome.

470
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,380
Is this rooted in desire, sensuality, greed, aversion?

471
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,380
Is this rooted really in your will, desire to harm or something?

472
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:24,380
What is generally rooted in good, in non-greed, non-aversion?

473
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,380
And if once you discern it, you'll be able to then not act afterwards.

474
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:35,380
What do you need to do? You don't need to try to get rid of the possibilities of unwholesome.

475
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,380
They're just part of how things arise.

476
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,380
You can use it for good or for bad.

477
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,380
Responsibilities on your choice are hard to use it.

478
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,380
Not on the possibility of how it can be used.

479
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:56,380
But none of that can become apparent if you're just sort of completely, if you're completely obscured,

480
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,380
that responsibility of your own choice, that wholesome, that unwholesome.

481
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,380
And you've secured it through denying or through projecting it onto someone else.

482
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,380
Someone else's fault, it's the God's will and everything else.

483
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:15,380
Say, even if it's God's will to present you with a certain choice, he can't make you choose this A over B.

484
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:21,380
That's why the early existential philosophy said, it's not that the phenomenology and phenomenological method,

485
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,380
it's atheistic or anything like that.

486
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,380
It's basically just recognizing the fact that God has no power over your choice.

487
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,380
So you can allow the gods to exist as much as you want.

488
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
But none of the gods can tell you how to choose it.

489
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,380
You are the one who chooses what God told you to act upon it.

490
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,380
Which means, whether things come your way out of complete circumstance,

491
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:50,380
or randomness, accident, gods will, previews action, previews karma and the path and whatever else,

492
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,380
makes no difference because you presently are responsible for choosing how to act upon it.

493
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:59,380
Oh, this is because of, no, a lot of, sorry.

494
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,380
I've done this because of that.

495
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,380
No, because you've done that because you chose this to be the reason for it.

496
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,380
Because you can always say no to everything, or yes to everything.

497
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Which means, you can always do the opposite of whatever is presented to you.

498
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
Means the choice is always a new.

499
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:29,380
That's why the whole definition in the philosophy was basically, man is condemned to be free.

500
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,380
But you cannot not choose.

501
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Sometimes people think if I abstained from choice, I didn't choose.

502
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,380
But abstaining from choice, it's another choice.

503
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
You just chose that.

504
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,380
That's why the Buddha said, the being means exactly this basically.

505
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Beings are bound with their actions.

506
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
They cannot escape them.

507
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,380
As in abstaining from your action becomes an action for you.

508
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,380
So the only way to escape the action is to truly first accept it,

509
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,380
and then see the degree of your responsibility in it and stop maintaining a fact.

510
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:11,380
You're trying to overly deny action or overly explain it.

511
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,380
Sorry.

512
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,380
So in practical terms, people want to meditate and practice correctly.

513
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:29,380
In this manner, always keep a corner of your eye at the back of your mind,

514
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,380
basically where your intentions are.

515
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Now you do something, checking yourself, why are you doing it?

516
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,380
Why do you want to do it?

517
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,380
You always get an answer.

518
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:44,380
It might take a time to cut through all that, like layers of cover-ups, but it's there.

519
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
You know the truth.

520
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,380
You know the truth.

521
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,380
As we were discussing before, similarly I was telling you,

522
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,380
for the example, it was really simply good.

523
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:00,380
Say you're somebody who is on a...

524
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,380
That's a beautiful ego.

525
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,380
You're somebody who is on a not necessarily a strict meditation retreat,

526
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,380
but say you're practicing seclusion, practicing non-distraction and so on.

527
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:21,380
And then you have a thought that arises, I want to go to the library in the monastery.

528
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,380
And now to get some sort of books so I can read and study harder.

529
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,380
Now I see on the external, based on the external point of view,

530
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,380
that's a good thing to do.

531
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,380
Reading suit does, enriching the basis of your knowledge, contemplation and so on.

532
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,380
But that's not the point of view that matters.

533
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,380
It's the internal point of view that matters for whoever practices it.

534
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,380
So where you usually want to do notes, like try to justify your impending action

535
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,380
based on the external acceptance of it or denial of it,

536
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,380
you want to justify it or not based on the internal reasoning.

537
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,380
So if you start looking at it, why do I really want to go to the library

538
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
and take these books right now?

539
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,380
Wait for a while because probably you're not going to get the answer immediately.

540
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,380
But you can then see that, oh actually I want to go because I hope there will be some people there

541
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,380
and I'll end up being distracted.

542
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,380
I'll end up talking to somebody because I feel a bit, well,

543
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,380
pressure of doing nothing being alone.

544
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,380
So going into the group of people can alleviate that pressure.

545
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,380
But I can't admit that to myself directly.

546
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,380
So I go, I find an excuse of going to a library to take the suitors.

547
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,380
Where I know there is a 90% chance they will be like-minded people

548
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
and they're going to start talking to me.

549
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
But that's the whole point.

550
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,380
Then I won't feel responsible for choosing to distract myself

551
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,380
because of what they started talking to me.

552
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,380
It would have been rude to just remain silent.

553
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,380
But you fail to see that you already decided to talk to them

554
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,380
by making yourself liable to that possibility.

555
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,380
Of going in the environment where there is a good likelihood of people distracting you

556
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,380
from your own basically self-awareness and solitude and so on.

557
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,380
So now you can say, oh, so I'll never go to a library again.

558
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Well, that's also impossible.

559
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,380
That's also trying to overdoing it.

560
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,380
No, go to the library but for the right reasons.

561
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,380
There might be a genuine need to go to a library,

562
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,380
but it was the unwholesome part of your mind that made it into the unwholesome.

563
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,380
Rooted it in unwholesome desire.

564
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Because yes, certain things you can abandon straight away.

565
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,380
Engagement, sensuality, sexuality, lying, stealing, you abandon that.

566
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
There is no wholesome way of doing that.

567
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,380
But as the Buddha pointed out, there are things such as eating food.

568
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,380
You can't stop that because you die.

569
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:39,380
But if you eat it carelessly, if you're not aware of your reasons behind eating the food,

570
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,380
if you don't keep those reasons present and clear, if you don't develop clarity in regard to them,

571
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:50,380
inevitably you're going to eat out of greed and out of sensuality, out of enjoyment for taste,

572
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,380
not need for the nutriments.

573
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,380
And that's something you have to responsibly maintain each time you eat the food.

574
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,380
And that's the whole point of that contemplation.

575
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:05,380
I will eat for the sake of health and sustenance of the body, strength so I can continue practicing.

576
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,380
I will not eat for beautification, I will not eat for sensual enjoyment, I will not eat for taste.

577
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,380
But that's not something that's always written, like, decided for you.

578
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,380
That's something that you choose to decide every time you go to eat food.

579
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,380
So in this particular instance, all you need to do is be careless of you eating the food

580
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,380
and immediately become central.

581
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,380
If you're not careless, it doesn't go into sensuality.

582
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,380
But people, that's that harder to maintain.

583
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,380
So it's much easier to then just say, I'll not eat food or I'll only eat food that I hate and so on.

584
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,380
That doesn't matter, you're still going to eat for unwholesome reasons then.

585
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,380
Because the unwholesomeness of eating food for unwholesome reasons, it's not in the food.

586
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,380
It's in your carelessness.

587
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,380
So in the example of going to the library, no.

588
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:53,380
You can still go to the library if you really need to get the suttas or other books that might help you contemplate further.

589
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,380
But then you do it very, very carefully.

590
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,380
Go to the hours when you know the Bombay people.

591
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,380
If there are people of void looking at them.

592
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:07,380
If you have to look at them, avoid talking to them even in the sake of being rude.

593
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,380
And that's how you know you will not give rise to the unwholesome.

594
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,380
But if you just say, I'll never step outside of my house.

595
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,380
I'm going to be locked in this cell for three months.

596
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,380
I will not talk to anybody ever again.

597
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,380
You're just obscuring the problem.

598
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,380
You're not going to see where the line of your responsibility is.

599
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,380
Why? Because you're denying the whole thing.

600
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:33,380
That's why the Buddha did make action sort of fence to engage in a practice of silence, not talking to anybody.

601
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:39,380
Ever again, because they were like those ascetic surroundings that would just refuse to speak for the rest of their life.

602
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,380
They said, well, it's misguided.

603
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,380
But most people would just jump on the first excuse.

604
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,380
Or why they need to go to the library?

605
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,380
Oh, because together suttas and that's a good thing.

606
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,380
Okay, fine.

607
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,380
While the real reason remains underneath right there.

608
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,380
But they refuse to look at it.

609
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,380
Because then it will feel you will guilt, anxiety, sense of responsibility, which is already a burden.

610
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
And that's where the practice is.

611
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,380
I'm doing that burden.

612
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,380
But in order to do the burden of responsibility, first you need to accept it.

613
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:33,380
Not deny it.
