1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And so my first question was actually, you spoke about it in the last video by, as it happens,

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
was related to what you mean by delighting in sensuality.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But you did speak about it in the last video and it was quite clear when you said that it's kind of in that attitude of anticipation,

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
an initial attitude of anticipation or background attitude of anticipation towards a particular experience or something.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And then I think the question that I wanted to just to make sure that just to clarify it is,

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:28,000
what would be the difference between delighting in a sensual thought of sensual nature and engaging mentally in a sensuality?

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is there a difference between those two things?

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, yes, but they're not on the same level. If you were not delighting, you wouldn't be able to engage mentally.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So delight is the basis for mental engagement. So you can then not engage mentally, but still delight.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But if you don't delight, even thinking about the sensuality of sensuality, there's no delight.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, that's good, that's kind of what I thought. The delight is more like the necessary condition for you to be able to engage in a thought of sensual nature in a sense that's...

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
To welcome it, to enlighten it, except for the joy that promises and so on, basically to take it for granted.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And so even if you're just sitting and not even moving or doing anything, there is a difference between having an attitude of wanting to go towards something, welcoming it and delighting it.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And then you can then even actively, then there is this active thinking about something of whatever pleasant experience that you want to have or something that you can actively be thinking about it.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But before that, there has to be already, or prior, let's say, underlying it, there is that attitude.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Which remains there. It gives you the meaning, gives the context of what your mind is revolving around.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And that's why, that's why a lot of people would more often than often meditate with sensuality. I mean, suit us the same.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And the point is exactly that, so you might be saying no to the central objects, so you're not engaging with them.

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're refusing to think about them, you're concentrating away from them, you're getting rid of those thoughts.

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But is your mind still expecting pleasure, delight in joyful ideas of whatever meditation experience and so on, and say, yes, so that's, that is your intention, that is your context, that is your motivation.

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So when you sit to meditate, to sit to meditate in a way of discerning the enduring body there, the basis for the subject to do all these reflections,

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:04,000
or you sit to meditate to constantly devote to get, to produce the experience of pleasing kind. And then that's just exactly the same central principle.

23
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, yeah.

24
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's in that sense, like even people would take on the seal and the virtue, but in that kind of a conditional way.

25
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They would take it because yes, they were told they need to take it in order to get this special experience of meditation and enlightenment.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But if you're actually, if your meditation is on the level of reviewing your situation, the body, the context, the danger, the pattern, the disenchantment, that is better to give it up, then you realize, oh no,

27
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
a seal of virtue is what protects me from falling deeper into this. It's not conditional anymore.

28
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's indirectly for what it is, abstaining from certain axes, what created this context of recognizing the trap, the bait, and everything else.

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That brings me to another, yeah, that's exactly the other thing I wanted to ask about or check.

30
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is that this, it seems that the danger in relation to sensuality or sin, but again, I have another come back to that in a minute.

31
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Or even the whole domain of the senses and engagement into the senses involved with the senses, because there's, let's say, two broadly speaking aspects of danger that kind of appear more or less clearly to me at different times.

32
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:02,000
One of which is really in relation to the nature of this particular type of, let's say, you kind of, you can learn to recognize a particular type of, let's say, perception, or if you're in seclusion, there's nothing else, it's more like a thought, type of thought.

33
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not about, initially, it will be about certain types of objects, but it's more about the nature of the thought that it contains an invitation or a hook, or it requires you to, it wants you to do something to become involved in a particular type of sense of object, or a particular type of activity or experience in some way.

34
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Like, then in relation to that, there is the danger of, like, the mind becoming disturbed, and you having to kind of hand yourself, you becoming involved, hand yourself on this particular object, or, let's put it like that.

35
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That you become dependent on all of this, this experience, getting something, wanting something, what will happen if we don't get it, what will happen on account of this, becoming busy on account of this, and, yeah, so that's the kind of type of, of danger of, the danger of involvement or being required to do a particular thing.

36
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is there a more, even more immediate type of danger implicit?

37
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's, there is, it seems like a second aspect of danger, which is really more about the fact that the, about the nature of the body, such as the senses, as such.

38
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But that nature is there, regardless of whether you're engaged with centrality or not, so what's dangerous about it?

39
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
In one case, why isn't danger is in another case?

40
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes, because the reason why, yeah, because if, if you can kind of, let's say,

41
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you see, you start to recognize that, regardless of...

42
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, let's say, where does the pain come from, suffering? What's the origin of suffering?

43
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The craving.

44
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The craving, yeah. And what is the, where does the craving exist?

45
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Is it a physical thing?

46
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, it's an in your attitude towards things.

47
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So it's a mental thing.

48
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Is the mental craving, which any craving is mental, so is the craving a method of choice?

49
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Can you choose the craving, which is not to crave?

50
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So craving is something the mind does, which means suffering is something that mind causes.

51
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is the mind something you ask for, something you can control, something you can own, something that obeys you?

52
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No, kind of, you are aligned with it, so to speak.

53
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It obeys you most of the time, if the circumstances are alright.

54
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But if circumstances change, that's when you realize that mind doesn't actually want to listen to you.

55
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You can't stop it. And then you suffer and counter it.

56
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So then, you want to be free from suffering, means you need to be free from craving,

57
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
which means you need to teach your mind how to stop doing it.

58
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Or you need to basically understand your mind or semantic mind.

59
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Either way, mind does the craving.

60
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So how do you then stop that?

61
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And that's where the danger is.

62
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The danger of sensuality is the danger of still, the slight doesn't matter.

63
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The little bit of sensuality means there is still a little possibility of that mind craving against you.

64
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Against itself, resisting, but eager against anything that that, and you can't control that.

65
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So you cannot, you can have wishful thinking and hope that the mind won't,

66
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
because you know, you're so calm and you've been keeping precepts for so long.

67
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Fundamentally, for as long as there is a trace of sensuality,

68
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the other backside of that same trace, same phenomenon, same values of sensuality

69
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
is the value of the wild mind, which means the craving remains there.

70
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And if you want to see whether your mind still has that uncontrollable threat

71
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
that would turn against itself and cause you immense suffering,

72
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
if circumstances change, if you lose health, life and so on,

73
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you have just practiced sensory strain and solitude and you'll see when the mind doesn't get what he wants,

74
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
it's going to start getting wound up.

75
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And then you will recognize that that's the root of the suffering.

76
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's the craving.

77
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So I can't stop the craving.

78
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't will it away.

79
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can't just choose it.

80
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But what I can do is take the mind so it becomes unable to turn against itself.

81
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And that's where it recognizes true dangerous sensuality.

82
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So giving in to sensual desire, even on the mental level,

83
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
valuing it means allowing mind to remain wild to that extent.

84
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And sooner or later, that will bite you back.

85
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So it's not a delayed danger.

86
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's the other side of the same coin.

87
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And that's that when danger becomes apparent, means this,

88
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
as we said, this anticipation, this delight,

89
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
literally this thing while it is present,

90
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the background of it is mind eating itself, the possibility of it.

91
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Won't do it there, but the fact is you're allowing it.

92
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And if you go that way, to that extent,

93
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
you gave your own mind room to turn against itself.

94
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then it will.

95
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Sooner or later, it will.

96
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
As long as you don't abandon that attitude and that anticipation

97
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and you don't see thoroughly the peril of giving in to that direction.

98
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Once you do, and as the Buddha said,

99
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you drive up from sensuality internally,

100
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
then the mind, the animal will be completely tamed.

101
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It will forget how to turn against itself.

102
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And that's where you recognize that, okay, so now,

103
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
suffering cannot arise.

104
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Even if the circumstances are completely falling apart around me.

105
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Everything, disintegrating.

106
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What cannot happen is mind turned against itself,

107
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
because you tamed it.

108
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But you won't aim it for as long as there is,

109
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
as long as you allow it to eat the bait,

110
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
or welcome the bait with delight in the bait.

111
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Think about the bait.

112
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And the bait, really, is basically a prospect of pleasure.

113
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Sure.

114
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

115
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But the value of pleasure, delight and pleasure,

116
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
prospect of pleasure.

117
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So the bait is also, like, it's not prospect of pleasure.

118
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can show the bait, but it also

119
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
simply cannot seem the danger enough.

120
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's also what the bait is.

121
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's what it means.

122
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You are not recognizing the bait.

123
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Seeing the danger is how you basically stop by the end of pleasure,

124
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and recognize the bait.

125
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The bait is the bait.

126
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, the bait is the bait.

127
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So it's not, well, I'm trying to say,

128
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
it's not like that you don't need to actively seek out,

129
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and then, oh, I don't actively seek out,

130
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
thus I'm free from bait.

131
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No, do you now, by OK, you don't actively seek out,

132
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
but do you now see the danger if you were to seek out?

133
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And if you don't see the danger, to that extent,

134
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
yeah, you still don't see the bait.

135
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't see the bait.

136
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You don't see the danger.

137
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, exactly.

138
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And when the bait, or when this prospect is seen as the bait,

139
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
as something that will hook me, then delight.

140
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Well, no, when the prospect of that anticipation

141
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is seen, this thing is what makes mind bite itself.

142
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Exactly.

143
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's what I meant.

144
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah.

145
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's when there's nothing, no pleasure in the world.

146
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah.

147
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Because it's not that it's that like they...

148
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's nothing to do with the thing you want.

149
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's nothing.

150
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's that like...

151
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Giving it to that or maintaining that or not seeing the danger

152
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
that it perpetuates, enables the mind,

153
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and it perpetuates that enabling of mind to bite itself.

154
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

155
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
When things change, when you apparently what you don't want,

156
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
separate it from what you want, you know,

157
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
the five codes of central pleasure and so on,

158
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and you know that, you know that.

159
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You will not be able to stop it.

160
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You can just hope and ignore it, but factually,

161
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
if there is a room for a mind to bite itself,

162
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
it will.

163
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Because you're out of it.

164
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And that's the danger.

165
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So, yes, you can involve the future peril,

166
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and this satisfaction, sure, to reign it in,

167
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
but fundamentally, accepting this means mind biting itself.

168
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

169
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, that's exactly what I meant.

170
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's so nice to...

171
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Matches.

172
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah, like the danger is in that any kind of...

173
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's what you just said.

174
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm going to repeat it, but that is the danger.

175
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's nothing to do with what will happen

176
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
in the future, what could happen in the future,

177
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
or whatever, because, yeah, that's like,

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
oh, it could not happen, or it could be fine,

179
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
or whatever.

180
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But it's just that fact of being hooked,

181
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
like having this...

182
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, having a hook, having a push,

183
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
having any kind of craving is in itself

184
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
to be not desired, to be not welcomed.

185
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because it's the way...

186
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's like the gateway to hell, really.

187
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah.

188
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's...

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah.

190
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, this great mass of suffering,

191
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
as the person described.

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah.

193
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's the great way to...

194
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's it. That's because of that.

195
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The great mass of suffering,

196
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and the great mass of suffering,

197
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
is always on the count of the same.

198
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The same.

199
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The presence of craving.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, that is...

201
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Everything else is second to it.

202
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And as we describe, presence of craving,

203
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
full stop is something that the mind

204
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that has a been-tain will do.

205
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
When faced with a agreeable,

206
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
disagreeable or neutral,

207
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
which means the great mass of suffering

208
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
remains something that you are under.

209
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So you are liable to it,

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
you will be subjected to it.

211
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But, if the danger of centrality

212
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
has been understood, I...

213
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, okay.

214
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So, without...

215
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If I don't give in to this,

216
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
if I don't welcome this,

217
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
because now I see,

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
if I do, this is the result.

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The result is,

220
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
mind remaining able

221
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
to eat itself,

222
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
if it wants to.

223
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
In a split second,

224
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
not like, you know,

225
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
it will not be a long process.

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
All you need to do is face with something

227
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you don't want to face with,

228
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and all the dread and pain

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and everything will be instantaneously there.

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Because the mind will just try to

231
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
turn away from it.

232
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Who resisted it?

233
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because again, you let it,

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
you gave it room to do so.

235
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And that's why it's...

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's hard to see,

237
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
because, you know,

238
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
room to do so,

239
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
doesn't mean the mind is doing it all the time.

240
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So, you then forget that the mind can still do it.

241
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It can still turn against itself.

242
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It can still want to deny its own existence,

243
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
out of pain and aversion and hatred

244
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and ill will and so on.

245
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But because it's not doing that all the time,

246
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you sort of forget

247
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that there is room for it to still

248
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
turn around and sink its teeth.

249
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah.

250
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So, that's the danger.

251
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah.

252
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And that was something...

253
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That was another point, that's...

254
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's why...

255
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Like, it's not...

256
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Being like having a kind of a sense of safety or something

257
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
is not about just currently not feeling

258
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
any sort of pressure of the sensual kind

259
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
because you can have that,

260
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
even for quite a long time, for example.

261
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Sure.

262
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But as soon as something comes up,

263
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
something arises,

264
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
if at that moment,

265
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
then you will be going in that direction,

266
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
not able to see the problem

267
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and not recognizing it for what it is.

268
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Then there is no safety, really, at all.

269
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So, it's...

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So, where is the safety then?

271
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Then the safety is when you know where the danger is,

272
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
then you know that no matter when it will...

273
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So, you know now that the danger is in mind being able

274
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
to turn against itself.

275
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So, what is then the safety?

276
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, if you see the danger of that,

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
then the...

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If the mind is able to turn itself against itself,

279
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
what makes the mind being able to turn itself against itself?

280
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's something that you are responsible for,

281
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
but you can't choose to not do.

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So, if you recognize the danger of doing that,

283
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
which makes the mind able to turn against itself,

284
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
then you can not do that.

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah, and then eventually,

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
the mind will cease to be able to turn against itself.

287
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah.

288
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And then that's true safety.

289
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You can't suffer.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Craving cannot arise.

291
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, so you said that now, like recognizing

292
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
where the danger is,

293
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is the necessary condition for safety.

294
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And then is there...

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But is there, yeah, is there also a sense

296
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
that they kind of...

297
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I think it's something slightly different.

298
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's say from the perspective of

299
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
not having any safety,

300
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
there is...

301
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
If you're still in the domain of sensuality

302
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and kind of involved in it,

303
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I kind of don't see how it's possible

304
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
in a way to see the danger in it.

305
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It kind of requires at least say,

306
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
maybe not the complete sense of safety,

307
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
but at least a pretty complete seclusion

308
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
in order to then have the perspective of...

309
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's very sensory-spainting,

310
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
garden with the sense those

311
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
is a prerequisite that's normally optional.

312
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah.

313
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It needs to be your lifestyle,

314
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
your more complete feeling.

315
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah, of course.

316
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
In itself, you will still not see

317
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
where the danger is and so on.

318
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But for sure, if you're not withdrawn,

319
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
then you're removing the possibility of seeing it.

320
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And it's like we said before,

321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
like lighting the fire.

322
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We need them out of the water first.

323
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Like, if you try to light the fire

324
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
with sticks in the water,

325
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that's just not going to work.

326
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So you take them out, but they're still wet.

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So although, yes, they're out of water.

328
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They're still wet, so they still won't light the fire.

329
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But now at least there is a possibility

330
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
that they're drying.

331
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
If you don't put them back in the water.

332
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And while they're dry,

333
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
thoroughly, then you can light the fire.

334
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And that's it. The mind is first physically

335
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
be drawn from sensuality,

336
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
not giving it to this behavior,

337
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
because you recognize on it, no.

338
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Like our faith to the degree,

339
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but at the same time, you do recognize,

340
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I've been going down the direction of the senses,

341
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
my whole life.

342
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And look, I want to practice.

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I want to be free from suffering,

344
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
because this is what it resulted in.

345
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So then you found the Buddhist teaching,

346
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
you have a degree of faith, you start applying it.

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And you can even intellectually make sense

348
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
that actually it's better if I'm out of the water.

349
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Even if I've done a silly seed,

350
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and so on.

351
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Well, at least I have the possibility to do so,

352
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
if I stay out of the water.

353
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah.

354
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And like that.

355
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But in and of itself, that's not a goal.

356
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

357
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The goal is to light the fire,

358
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and you don't forget that.

359
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yeah.

360
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And again, just to clarify slightly further,

361
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
that being out of the water,

362
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
because this could be maybe understood in different ways,

363
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
as far as I can see,

364
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
it really has to become quite

365
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
complete seclusion, as in

366
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
it wouldn't really be,

367
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
because yeah, it can be kind of more or less

368
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
restrained and keeping the virtue.

369
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But if you are still like busy

370
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
doing various things,

371
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and kind of distracting yourself in any way,

372
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
really, then you kind of can't really even see

373
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the which type of

374
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
is the...

375
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, well that's like seeing the danger in the slightest fault.

376
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There's not mean seeing the danger in the slightest fault

377
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
of the latter,

378
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and the semantics of the rule,

379
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
means the danger of the slightest fault

380
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
of, okay, so yes, I'm not giving this...

381
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm not giving it to desire by body,

382
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
but to this course extent,

383
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that I'm still looking forward to

384
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
anything things that are allowable, as we said before.

385
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Also, I'm gonna stop eating, you must stop eating with that desire.

386
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You can't stop eating.

387
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That's the point.

388
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But if a person never recognized that that's where the true danger

389
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and the fault is,

390
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and still remain on the level of, you know,

391
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
or I studied all the dictionary,

392
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and I got the definition of the rule,

393
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and this is what objectively means,

394
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and our fault in regard to that interpretation

395
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
is what I didn't even fault.

396
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I just need to fix the circumstances

397
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and make everybody else obey it.

398
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's not seeing the fault.

399
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's not allowing, basically,

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
vinegar and sensitive strength

401
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
to make your practice on the level of the mind.

402
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That is just using it to protect yourself

403
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
through that magical belief that that's where the purity is.

404
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So, in order to abandon

405
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
so about the Paramasya,

406
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and it's not in the letter,

407
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
it's not in the definition,

408
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
it's in like, why am I doing this?

409
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So, you'll find something that's not against the rules,

410
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
but that still doesn't absolve you from needing to know

411
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and feel the weight of why you're doing it.

412
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, coffee is allowable to have in the afternoon,

413
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and I can have sugar.

414
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But why?

415
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Why am I doing this?

416
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Where is this rooted?

417
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, yeah, it's been, you know,

418
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
very often touched, you know, with a bowing,

419
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
triple bowing on a tray.

420
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So, it's just a pure suffering,

421
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I can imagine, in that external form sense.

422
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But, yeah, but that's,

423
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
that's irrelevant.

424
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The fault is not in how it was done and presented.

425
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The fault is why am I doing this?

426
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Do I need it? Why, why is this rooted?

427
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And then same would come to exactly like,

428
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
oh, yeah, so, you know,

429
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
we are allowed to work and do these things,

430
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and like, but it will work.

431
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, what I was like seeing is, you know,

432
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in the city where it is, where it is,

433
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
where it is.

434
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Well, it's the same stuff, you know,

435
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
one of the studies.

436
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
One, these duties that you perceive

437
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
are kind of self-evident and objectively valid.

438
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's not where the validity is determined.

439
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's determined by your intentions

440
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and the reasons why you do it.

441
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So, yes, obvious things are of greed,

442
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
version delusion, eight presets basically

443
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
are not to be broken.

444
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But now all the other in permutation

445
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
doesn't mean you can dismiss them.

446
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Quite the opposite.

447
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Means you need to take more of them just on the right level.

448
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Less specifically,

449
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
but more because you're taking responsibility

450
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
for where the actual fault is.

451
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The mind of desire,

452
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
mind of aversion, and mind of distraction.

453
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But if we judge what needs to be done

454
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
on the base of authority of the texts,

455
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
which is again a contradiction in terms,

456
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
like, you will always have your interpretation of it.

457
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
There is no such thing as objective meaning of the text.

458
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's what it means to you and to us.

459
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And vast majority of people

460
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
might agree upon the meaning,

461
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
but every single one of them

462
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
is individually subjective and responsible

463
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
for that meaning.

464
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So, the weight of the tradition,

465
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
the authority, and so on,

466
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that's not where these things are.

467
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But if you never abandon that,

468
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
out of fear of doubt and so on,

469
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
well, you never allow your mind

470
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
to recognize where the true fault is

471
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and thus have brewed it,

472
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
out of fear of doubt.

473
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So, that's when you're like,

474
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
you need to get out of the water

475
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
for the sake of drying the sticks,

476
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
not for the sake of drying out the water

477
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and then just, you know,

478
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
defining what the water was and how you dry

479
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and, you know, what you must, what you can,

480
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
what you cannot do.

481
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
From the point of view of desire,

482
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
you can't do anything.

483
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You're not out of water.

484
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
If the light in the fire is your goal.

485
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If not, you know,

486
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
if just living in a spiritual community

487
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
that agrees upon certain terms and interpretations,

488
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
is your goal then fine.

489
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But that's not what we're talking about.

490
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So, just to come back to this,

491
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
the degree of, let's say,

492
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
the degree of seclusion.

493
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And it's, I think, in the studies that

494
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
sometimes even says like,

495
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
he goes into physical seclusion

496
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and mental seclusion.

497
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Physical or physical withdrawal

498
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and mentally secluded.

499
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Or mentally withdrawn.

500
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Can you be mentally withdrawn if you're not physically withdrawn?

501
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
No, you cannot.

502
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So, there's the physical sense of withdrawal

503
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
but even there, it needs more

504
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
than, like, physically

505
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
being secluded as in a secluded environment

506
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
or just being restrained.

507
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
There is necessity for mental

508
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
to be mentally withdrawn

509
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
from even mentally engaging

510
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
in unwholesome things

511
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
for which you need to be able to already see

512
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
how you are mentally engaging with unwholesome things.

513
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
In order to then be able to see the danger

514
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
in doing so, in order to then

515
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
kind of have any kind of sense of safety.

516
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So, in other words,

517
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
you need to basically

518
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
want to light the fire.

519
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And in order to do so,

520
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
you need to abandon

521
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
things, external things,

522
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
avoidance of responsibilities,

523
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
external authorities, external agreements,

524
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
as the measure of your safety,

525
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
purity, practice

526
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and defining what you need to do.

527
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You need to abandon your perceived sense of duty.

528
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So, you need to abandon

529
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
so about Parmas basically.

530
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That's used. You know, these fetters

531
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and all these random things, they serve purpose.

532
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You're fettered willingly

533
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
by them because they protect you

534
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
from that which is very displeasing.

535
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The weight of responsibility,

536
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
the weight of interpretation,

537
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
the weight of choices and so on.

538
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So, you have a choice to make.

539
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You can remain sheltered,

540
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
covering things up.

541
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And if you want to uncover it,

542
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
then you have to unshelter it.

543
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's to me like,

544
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
the true safety comes from mind being unable

545
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
to turn against itself.

546
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But in order to arrive there,

547
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
you need to stop covering up the fact

548
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that the mind can't turn against itself.

549
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh, but I'm fine.

550
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You know, I keep the precepts and the pure

551
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and the devotional and stuff.

552
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That is all just conditional.

553
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Sure, that's nice in a worldly sense.

554
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But then you need to start asking yourself,

555
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
why am I doing this?

556
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
If I took, oh no, I agree with this,

557
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
with this tradition of interpretation

558
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
or whatever else the way we should do.

559
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Fine, but you still need to know why

560
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and take responsibility for it.

561
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's never on them. It's never on others.

562
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's never on the, as I said,

563
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
on the external world.

564
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Even if you say, yeah, I'll agree

565
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to what you already agreed.

566
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That still doesn't absorb me from needing to know

567
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
why I'm doing that and think for myself

568
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and take responsibility for it.

569
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But often that's exactly why it's done.

570
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I will go with majority,

571
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
with the tradition, with the established voice

572
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
so I don't have to think for myself.

573
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But you are thinking for yourself,

574
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
now you're just lying to yourself about it.

575
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Because how would you choose to go

576
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
with the tradition with established voice

577
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
unless you thought about it?

578
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And gave into it. And now you're just saying,

579
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
no, no, I just go, but I do what others say.

580
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So you do need to take responsibility for it

581
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and then it ceases to be on that level.

582
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And then you realize it's all,

583
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
it is all interpretation.

584
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It precepts that interpretation.

585
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Like, yeah, you know,

586
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
you can bend in this way, bend in that way, sure.

587
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But fundamentally, you realize, okay,

588
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
you could extrapolate the principle of

589
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
creed, the version delusion, central desire,

590
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
ill will,

591
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
carelessness, distraction.

592
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
That is what needs to be restrained.

593
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
How we define it? And can I touch this?

594
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And if it's touch, can I do this?

595
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Well, you know, if I said it,

596
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
okay, you can go into these details if it's helpful.

597
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But not for the sake of deriving safety

598
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
from the definition that you read in a book

599
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
or had seen your mind told you.

600
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But simply from knowing more

601
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
how to recognize the root of the problem

602
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
in your mind.

603
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So the degree delusion doesn't hide from you

604
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
or did you don't feel absorbed from it?

605
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So when I recognize that there is nothing

606
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I, nothing at all,

607
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I have to do.

608
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
For nothing at all that I can do

609
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
that can absorb me from taking the

610
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
responsibility for whatever I choose to do.

611
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yeah, also,

612
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
so the more, on a more immediate level,

613
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
it will be, if you abandon still about

614
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
parmasters, it will be like,

615
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
oh, I don't need to do anything

616
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
in order to be safe.

617
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And that's some safe.

618
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So the relief of abandoning the factors,

619
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
it's factual.

620
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's not intellectual.

621
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And it's on the exact same level.

622
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
See, it is a burden.

623
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Having to define, having to follow,

624
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
having to update, having to comply,

625
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
having to do, having to perform.

626
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
All of that is a factual burden.

627
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You don't see the burden in aspect

628
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
because you emphasize the sheltering aspect.

629
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Once you stop sheltering,

630
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
in that aspect, you can actually eventually,

631
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
if you go into the right direction,

632
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
abandon the burden,

633
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
if I don't engage that way,

634
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I remain safe.

635
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I remain unexposed.

636
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So in a way, it's on the count of

637
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the loss of respect.

638
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't understand.

639
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Like you said, that you

640
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
pay more attention in a way to the

641
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
sheltering aspect, but not to

642
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
how it affects you.

643
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I wouldn't say it's on a kind of loss of

644
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
respect because you never had the respect.

645
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You start by not having the respect.

646
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So it's on a kind of

647
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
the lack of respect.

648
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Loss would imply you sort of had it

649
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and then you lost it.

650
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But, you know, you start already

651
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
fatted.

652
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah.

653
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's

654
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
why

655
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
it's like in a way that

656
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
like, said about a parama so, for example,

657
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
kind of covers up.

658
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's what it does.

659
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's what its purpose is really

660
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
is to make something appear

661
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
comfortable or feel comfortable.

662
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That isn't comfortable.

663
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And it shouldn't be comfortable.

664
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And as in this...

665
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
What do you mean?

666
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Because

667
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the avoiding responsibility

668
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
for things through having things

669
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
duties and others

670
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
depending on other things

671
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
that you...

672
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It kind of

673
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
makes this...

674
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah, makes it comfortable.

675
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I see what you mean.

676
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It makes it doable,

677
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
but actually nothing is changed

678
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
on a fundamental level.

679
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You're not closer to light in the fire.

680
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And so, you shouldn't be comfortable.

681
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You should recognize that

682
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
there is still

683
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
plenty of room

684
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
for mind to turn against itself

685
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
in many different ways.

686
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But yeah, you will feel

687
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
absolved from needing to deal with it

688
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
because, you know,

689
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
abide under the

690
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
collective responsibility

691
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
of majority that we all contributed

692
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and all but take. And I'm safe.

693
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Safe to the group.

694
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Safe to the tribe.

695
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah.

696
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's kind of gone off

697
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
in a different...

698
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's a very different direction.

699
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I wanted to come back to the...

700
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
If it's okay,

701
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
we're kind of going in different directions.

702
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I wanted to come back to the hindrances.

703
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Um...

704
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Because...

705
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Another question I had,

706
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I was...

707
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Because I often...

708
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I realized, basically, that often I would...

709
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Sometimes it's not that clear to me,

710
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
even what

711
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
exactly is meant

712
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
by, uh,

713
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
thought or a...

714
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Like a...

715
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah.

716
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Because sometimes...

717
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I often...

718
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm kind of...

719
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I think of it in terms of

720
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
not necessarily defined by particular...

721
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, particular objects

722
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
or having...

723
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Even something necessarily being agreeable in a way.

724
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
What I realized that

725
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
sometimes things that I was thinking of as, like,

726
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
yeah, sensuality

727
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and...

728
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Because it really pertains to, like,

729
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
engaging in some kind of experience

730
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
or feeling like the need to do something, really.

731
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Um...

732
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But it's not really...

733
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It would kind of come down to, like,

734
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
oh, that's more like doubt, or that's more, like,

735
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
kind of, one other one of the hindrances.

736
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
They do share the same kind of the same, yeah.

737
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
That's the thread of hindrances.

738
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That's the bond together.

739
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So, it can be on the level of specific

740
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
touch, on, like, the overall, uh,

741
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
agreeability of the, of, you know,

742
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
the experience.

743
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But, uh, it does always imply that

744
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
that sense of pleasure,

745
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
which is considered safe, friendly,

746
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
agreeable to me.

747
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That's when that's what the Brumel Vitox

748
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
was, perfect syllabus.

749
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It starts by, yeah, not having sexual intercourse.

750
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Uh, whether you're talking to monks

751
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
or not having sexual intercourse with women,

752
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
they're not touching them,

753
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
they're not going to be touched,

754
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
they're not, uh, talking to them,

755
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
they're not listening to them talk,

756
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
they're not looking at them,

757
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
they're not thinking about them,

758
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
they're not wishing about having a divorce.

759
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Hmm.

760
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So, it was the extension of the same principle.

761
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So, okay, I might have abandoned

762
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
any kind of physical corner,

763
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
all these pleasures that would be binding me here.

764
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Oh, but I still hope that this,

765
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I will find somewhere else here.

766
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So, new here, where it will be

767
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and safe for me, where pleasures will be accessible.

768
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Hmm.

769
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So, in other words, uh,

770
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
are you still valuing

771
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
a situation external

772
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
to your state of mind here and now?

773
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Hmm.

774
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That will provide the ability and pleasure.

775
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
There is a thread of centrality, yeah.

776
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And that's when, like, if, same,

777
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
like with its meditation or any other,

778
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
if you're expecting this thing to come on the level of just this external experience

779
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that just happened internally now

780
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and everything else,

781
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
you know, it's a very simple principle, yeah.

782
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

783
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And what kind of...

784
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So, you might, you know, sorry,

785
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
like, you know, you can't,

786
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
you cannot necessarily tell your mind

787
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
to immediately stop thinking about those things.

788
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But you can certainly not lose perspective or learn

789
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
after not lose perspective,

790
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
or are kind of having those thoughts present.

791
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Hmm.

792
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah, and the thing that's...

793
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And what would be the perspective, by the way?

794
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Let's say, how would you not lose a perspective

795
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
of the spectrum of sexual intercourse

796
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
with a, you know,

797
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
where we're not attracted to?

798
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Up to the level of wishing heavenly rebirths

799
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and safety of heavens.

800
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What is the...

801
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
How would you maintain perspective

802
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
at any part of that spectrum?

803
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Any thought, whatever it is,

804
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
what would maintain the perspective of the entire thing?

805
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Of the entire domain?

806
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
What would maintain the perspective of the...

807
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
What would make you not lose perspective?

808
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Whether it's a course,

809
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
carnal, central,

810
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
or heavenly...

811
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, it would be recognizing that danger

812
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
of that whole...

813
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's the same danger.

814
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah, it's the same danger of whether it's...

815
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yes, heavens, you know, it's better.

816
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Actually, sure.

817
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
If you have desire to heavens, then having desire to come

818
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and pleasure here and now, which your far was,

819
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
with far worse consequences,

820
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
unintended consequences.

821
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But fundamentally, if you want to be free from it all,

822
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
you don't want to leave the slightest room for your mind

823
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
to turn against itself,

824
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
even in hundreds of millions of years of time in the future,

825
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
it's the same danger.

826
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And then there will be no room for mind.

827
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And then the craving will truly be abandoned.

828
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah.

829
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
If the danger is seen there,

831
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
then it really doesn't matter at all,

832
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
whether there is no kind of even...

833
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Asking, oh, but it's a little or it's bigger,

834
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
it's smaller or not even...

835
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Whatever way it would never domain,

836
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
in whatever shape, whatever it's not about,

837
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
it's like...

838
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And the thing is, as well...

839
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And that's what Google described in the suit

840
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
as, you know, talk about aggregates and how it's

841
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
it's dangerous and I'm similar.

842
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And we said, it doesn't matter.

843
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But it's past, future, present, big, small, personal,

844
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
impersonal, foreign, familiar,

845
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
nice, light, heavy.

846
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And after the property of it,

847
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the danger is seen the same.

848
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Not mind, not to be welcomed,

849
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
not to be delighted in.

850
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And see that long enough,

851
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and the mind will come down.

852
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
In other words, the mind will become unable

853
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
to turn against itself.

854
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
God cannot be done anymore.

855
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And that's like the description of the true freedom,

856
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the true safety.

857
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It cannot be reverted back,

858
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
like a stone split into leaves,

859
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
sort of dried up.

860
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It cannot now go back.

861
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So it has completely dried.

862
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Fire as bullets, sticks will burn.

863
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
God, there are no more sticks to be wet.

864
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But then from the perspective of valuing pleasure,

865
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
that's exactly what a safety is seen.

866
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That's exactly what is seen as safe, basically.

867
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
What is...

868
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What is dangerous, so to say.

869
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Like the bait.

870
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Sure, sure.

871
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

872
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The prospect of, oh, let me get this.

873
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Yeah, let me have it.

874
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That's my safety.

875
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That's my safety.

876
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I enjoy the comfort of familiarity,

877
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the feeling, so the taste, the bait has.

878
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And as we said last time,

879
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
it does not start when I act.

880
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yeah, exactly.

881
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It starts when I already...

882
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
With the lightness, you're already...

883
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You're already not seeing it as dangerous.

884
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That's where it starts.

885
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And that's exactly what the...

886
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah, why?

887
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That's even the danger is in the delights,

888
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
in towards it.

889
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That's the gratification, that's the danger of us.

890
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's all on that, in that same kernel.

891
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's the same thing on it.

892
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Just different aspects of it.

893
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah.

894
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
That's how you keep it away is the same thing in a way.

895
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah.

896
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So yeah, if you were to not act out of the delights long enough

897
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and get to discern the background, not ignored,

898
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
you would see that the background over there is the bait.

899
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The delight is the bait.

900
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Exactly.

901
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The bait is the danger, the delight is the danger.

902
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It is the danger.

903
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Exactly.

904
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

905
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's really...

906
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And all the future consequences, it's all because of this.

907
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
This is the framework, this is the necessary basis.

908
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
This will be there if those consequences are ever too clear.

909
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And yeah, from the perspective of seeing that,

910
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
then the slightest prospect of going towards that,

911
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
going in that direction, is very unpleasant, actually.

912
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Or it would be very unpleasant.

913
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's almost like you're out of prison.

914
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And now you see the prison guard is going,

915
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
oh, come back in here.

916
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I have some very nice...

917
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I don't know, cake.

918
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But the fear would be on the level of,

919
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
oh, this crazy mind might forget and go back.

920
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

921
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Like, you know you wouldn't.

922
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But if the mind is still not saying,

923
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
if it still has room to move, you lose, that's the danger.

924
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah.

925
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And there was the similarly of the charcoal pit.

926
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah, man initially goes willingly there and burns and stuff

927
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
with the embers because he perceives it pleasant today.

928
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
He gets cured, he doesn't even need to.

929
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And if somebody were to pick him up and carry him there,

930
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
wouldn't he kick and scream,

931
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
wouldn't he be everywhere else except there?

932
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah.

933
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And it's like, yeah.

934
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And you really can't see like,

935
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
cause, you know, why would anybody want to,

936
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
like, actually go in that direction when,

937
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
but you do, that's what I kind of meant.

938
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
In a way for that, you do already need the perspective

939
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
of safe, like some kind of safety.

940
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You can't have that kind of perspective

941
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
from already being in it and seeing that as the safety.

942
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah, do you want to have, like, you know,

943
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
seeing that principle will be done on different levels,

944
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
like different layers.

945
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You'll be peeling it more and more.

946
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But yeah, it will be the same thing.

947
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But up until to the point, you realize that if I were to die

948
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the next second, will my mind have aversion towards that?

949
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Will it try to sort of, you know, resist it,

950
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
fight it, deal with it, avoid it, close its eyes,

951
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
look away.

952
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
If so, or if I'm not sure,

953
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
means there is still room for it to move,

954
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
to fight itself.

955
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So that cannot, should not be allowed,

956
00:44:37,000 --> 00:45:03,000
if I want to be truly free, secured from bondage.
