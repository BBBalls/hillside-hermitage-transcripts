 transcripts of hillside hermitage recordings

This repo is for the speech-to-text outputs from the Open AI Whisper app using the published .mp3 files of Hillside Hermitage. The majority of the generated transcripts are created using the base.en model. The raw output is of a good quality regarding word recognition, but still needs to be edited and formatted.

My hope is that it will make it easier for people to contribute to creating quality transcripts of the content provided by Hillside Hermitage. All of the audio recordings using the same file names can be found at [https://archive.org/details/hillside-hermitage-audio-archive](https://archive.org/details/hillside-hermitage-audio-archive).

If you decide to edit a raw transcript, edit and pull the working_list.csv by adding the file name of the transcript, the date, and your handle e.g. '"20210216 - 197hh - Can a layman be an arahant.txt", "2022-10-25", "BBBalls"'. To prevent duplicate efforts, check the working_list.csv.

When you finish editing a raw transcript, make a pull request to the draft_transcripts folder. It is preferred if the submitted draft transcript document is an UTF-8 plain text file using a lightwight markup language e.g. Markdown. OpenDocument files (.odt) are acceptable. Please do not submit transcripts as PDF or Office Open XMl (.docx) files.

Follow the file naming convention of the source file you are editing e.g. "20210216 - 197hh - Can a layman be an arahant.md".

Add a YAML metadata block at the beginning of the transcript document.

The transcripts of dialogues may need to be edited to increase readability; be generous and light-handed.

In the first instance of a speakers appearance write out their full designation. At other appearances, abbrivate their designation.

For example:

>Ajahn Nyanamoli:
>
>Thanino Thero:
>
>Speaker1:
>
>AN:

>S1:
>
>TT:

>AN:
