00:17.000 --> 00:24.920
TT: So this is from the Aṅguttara Nikāya and it's called 'Flies':

00:24.920 --> 00:30.840
The Blessed One says, "Bhikkhus, this morning I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and entered

00:30.840 --> 00:37.640
Vārāṇasī for alms. While walking for alms near the cattle-yoking fig tree, I saw a dissatisfied

00:37.640 --> 00:46.800
bhikkhu seeking gratification outwardly, confused, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, uncomposed,

00:46.800 --> 00:51.600
with a wandering mind and loose sense faculties.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.680
Having seen him, I said to that bhikkhu: ‘Bhikkhu, do not pollute yourself. It is inevitable,

00:57.680 --> 01:06.400
that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.’

01:06.400 --> 01:11.160
Then, being exhorted thus, that bhikkhu acquired a sense of urgency.”

01:11.160 --> 01:16.120
 When this was said, a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: “What, Bhante, is meant by ‘pollution’?

01:16.120 --> 01:19.880
What is the ‘stench’? And what are the ‘flies’?”

01:19.880 --> 01:25.320
He says, “Longing is what is meant by ‘pollution.’

01:25.320 --> 01:31.480
Ill will is the ‘stench.’ Bad unwholesome thoughts are the ‘flies.’ It is inevitable that flies will

01:31.480 --> 01:39.240
pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.”

01:39.240 --> 01:48.080
So you can have these unwholesome thoughts, these repetitive, evil thoughts --- of lust, of ill will.

01:48.080 --> 01:54.400
Why is that? Why are these flies there?

01:54.400 --> 01:55.680
AN: So how do you deal with the flies?

01:55.680 --> 02:00.480
You try to kill every fly individually, preventing the thoughts, dealing with them, antidoting them,

02:00.480 --> 02:05.800
managing them, removing them? Or, remove the reason why they are coming back?

02:05.800 --> 02:11.080
Ill will, longing, lust, distraction --- remove that, these thoughts will stop coming.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.080
We keep saying that.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.520
So that's how you abandon them.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.960
You have flies abandon you, by removing that which flies want.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.120
TT: The stench.

02:22.120 --> 02:26.160
AN: And you maintain the stench, you maintain the pollution, by acting out, by not being restrained,

02:26.160 --> 02:29.560
by not enduring things on the right level.

02:29.560 --> 02:33.800
That's exactly how you maintain craving, and longing, and aversion towards pain, and wanting pleasure,

02:33.800 --> 02:40.280
all the reasons that these flies keep coming back.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.960
So guard your sense doors, protect the context, don't act out, endure things on the right

02:44.960 --> 02:50.760
level, and flies will stop coming.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.480
TT: And they can come back?

02:52.480 --> 02:57.600
AN: If you lose your behavior, if you start acting, if you start basically accruing again,

02:57.600 --> 03:01.000
the stench, accumulating the stench, and the flies will come back.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.840
It's not something that can be done accidentally.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.360
Sure, it can be done carelessly, but because you kept choosing to act out, and go back

03:10.360 --> 03:15.280
to desires, and lose your sensory strength, and abandon the context, and give into distraction,

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
and so on.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.680
So then the flies will come back.

03:19.680 --> 03:23.840
But if you're of the view that the flies are the problem, and you must be dealing with

03:23.840 --> 03:30.480
the flies through concentrating, and this and that, and method to stop thinking,

03:30.480 --> 03:36.960
all these practices, and whatever people would misunderstand from the suttas, then you're

03:36.960 --> 03:40.580
still not emptying the rubbish, because of which the flies are coming.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.580
You're just chasing the flies more vehemently.

03:42.580 --> 03:48.360
TT: You're putting up these barriers, external barriers, and borders, and machines...

03:48.360 --> 03:52.440
AN: and nets, and traps, and repellents, but fundamentally...

03:52.440 --> 03:57.680
TT: While the very problem is the thing that's putting up the borders, and the tractors.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.560
AN: Yeah, that's where the bad smell is.

04:02.560 --> 04:07.920
So assuming you can spend a whole life of management, successful, to a degree, skilled,

04:07.920 --> 04:16.400
with protected circumstances, and so on, fundamentally, you're still in the same domain.

04:16.400 --> 04:20.680
So if you have thoughts of ill will, or thoughts of lust, and oh, I must get rid of this, this is the problem.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.320
No, that's the symptom of the problem.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.520
Those thoughts are there because your mind, as said many times, and in the suttas

04:26.520 --> 04:32.120
as well, frequently ponders and dwells on things that are attracting lust, lustful

04:32.120 --> 04:36.560
thoughts, and angry thoughts, and thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of distraction.


04:36.560 --> 04:38.840
So don't frequently ponder on those themes.

04:38.840 --> 04:39.840
What themes?

04:39.840 --> 04:44.600
Well, themes of pleasure is valuable, themes of aversion, of pain is justified, themes

04:44.600 --> 04:49.680
of these things belong to me, and I feel entitled to act out, and be free from suffering, and

04:49.680 --> 04:54.160
get this, and get my jhāna, and get whatever else, I don't want to deal with this.

04:54.160 --> 05:02.600
The themes of I, the themes of mine, all these themes that are contradictory to the universal natural experience.

05:02.600 --> 05:07.000
TT: Those wrong views of the dirt.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.680
AN: Yeah, they're perpetuating your attitudes of dirt, the attitudes

05:10.680 --> 05:20.200
of longing, the attitudes of aversion, wanting pleasure, aversion to pain, and as it comes

05:20.200 --> 05:23.560
out of those fundamental cravings.

05:23.560 --> 05:33.520
TT: You can't start the cleansing, if you have that wrong view that it is the world that is making me.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.280
AN: It's the flies that make me stink, yeah.

05:36.280 --> 05:41.040
No, that's not where the stench is, that's the symptom of the stench.

05:41.040 --> 05:46.440
If there are flies, it means there is something, and again, colloquially, flies keep coming

05:46.440 --> 05:52.520
back, I better check this room, I better check this building, something they keep coming back for.

05:52.520 --> 05:57.200
TT: But if you can't even admit that, then you don't have that mundane right view.

05:57.200 --> 06:01.280
AN: And you wouldn't admit that because it's just too much aversion towards flies.

06:01.280 --> 06:05.560
Lastful thoughts, I must get rid of it, and I must get rid of it, I must get rid of it.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.640
That's where the problem is.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.200
And then the idea of what meditation is, it sort of follows out of that, okay, let me

06:11.200 --> 06:17.000
just concentrate when I'm not aware of these things anymore, when I stop hearing the flies.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.080
That's how I'm free from it, you know That's just how you learn how to concentrate and

06:21.080 --> 06:22.640
look away from them.

06:22.640 --> 06:29.880
TT: So, you know, seeing where the stench is coming from, accepting that the flies are there because of the stench.

06:29.880 --> 06:34.840
AN: Yeah, so not wasting, not perpetuating your views of trying to deal with the flies, but

06:34.840 --> 06:42.040
actually focus of, okay, presence of flies means simultaneous presence of the that which

06:42.040 --> 06:43.360
flies are attracted to.

06:43.360 --> 06:49.800
So lustful thoughts cannot come, cannot exist, cannot assail me, I cannot be liable to them

06:49.800 --> 06:53.640
unless there is a simultaneously present state of lustful mind.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.280
Where is that lustful mind?

06:55.280 --> 06:59.000
It's not on the level of the flies and thoughts. It's on the level of signs and features, as

06:59.000 --> 07:00.520
we said before.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.600
So how do I discern that?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.960
What do I look for?

07:04.960 --> 07:06.520
What do I need to do in that sense?

07:06.520 --> 07:11.240
But yeah, if all you do is feel justified about dealing with the flies, through all sorts

07:11.240 --> 07:18.640
of, you know, management techniques and concentrations and so on, then yeah, there's none of this

07:18.640 --> 07:20.040
can apply to them.

07:20.040 --> 07:27.880
TT: But that seeing where the problem is, that's close to the right view, you know, that mundane,
so it's...

07:27.880 --> 07:28.880
AN: Yeah, sure.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.880
TT: You know, it's almost...

07:29.880 --> 07:33.240
AN: Well, it's kind of necessary for the right view, because if you don't even see where

07:33.240 --> 07:37.280
the problem is, you won't be able to learn how to endure things rightly.

07:37.280 --> 07:41.760
For you, endurance would just be, okay, I just have to put up with these flies and do nothing.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.760
No?

07:42.760 --> 07:47.680
You still got to do something, but it mustn't be aimed at the flies.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.560
But all I see is flies and doing something towards flies.

07:50.560 --> 07:55.160
Well, exactly, so you need to learn how else to do something without doing what you take

07:55.160 --> 07:59.640
for granted to be done, deal with the flies, deal with the things that bother me.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.640
TT: The middle way.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.640
AN: Yeah.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.480
TT: But if you're not, if you're going to be trying to deal with things all the time, manage things

08:05.480 --> 08:14.560
which are not the actual problem, as even if you're doing the Buddhist so-called, according

08:14.560 --> 08:16.560
your techniques and your management of the Buddhists...

08:16.560 --> 08:22.520
AN: Sure, verbatim, whatever, do what the Sutta says, you're not doing it on the right level.

08:22.520 --> 08:28.000
TT: And then in a very dangerous situation as well, because now you're establishing that

08:28.000 --> 08:31.680
for yourself as the way out of suffering, when in fact...

08:31.680 --> 08:32.680
AN: Yeah.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.680
TT: It's not.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.680
AN: And then you feel even more justified in managing and dealing with the flies and preventing

08:37.680 --> 08:42.840
flies from coming, not by removing the bait, but by setting up further traps and controlling

08:42.840 --> 08:49.960
the environment and avoiding things that disturb you, like you saw.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.200
TT: So how does one get the right view?

08:52.200 --> 08:57.560
AN: By not dealing with the flies.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.120
TT: Taking this by reflecting on what...

09:00.120 --> 09:01.640
AN: Where the problem is.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.640
TT: Where the problem is.

09:02.640 --> 09:07.120
AN: Although, you know, everything, all my senses are pointing me, it's because of this, this

09:07.120 --> 09:12.520
is why I'm lustful, this is why I'm angry, that's not what the Buddha said.

09:12.520 --> 09:17.040
The root of suffering is craving, not the world, not things in the world, not sense

09:17.040 --> 09:24.160
objects, not senses, not your thoughts, it's the craving in regard to what is felt.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.040
So that's always on me.

09:26.040 --> 09:30.560
And that's exactly why the right view starts with understanding what suffering is.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.360
Presence of craving means presence of suffering, not presence of flies or presence of this or that.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.920
So what is that craving that I need to understand?

09:37.920 --> 09:47.560
If you discern it, understand it, see its signs and features, that is the right view.

09:47.560 --> 09:51.560
You saw the cause of suffering, truly, correctly, accurately.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.720
Then you will know exactly what the escape from it is.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.840
You wouldn't need to figure it out as a next step or something.

09:58.840 --> 10:02.240
Seeing the presence of craving means, okay, so absence of craving means absence of suffering

10:02.240 --> 10:05.240
regardless of the flies and the circumstances.

10:05.240 --> 10:09.160
So what, how can I have that craving always absent?

10:09.160 --> 10:10.680
And that's the noble eightfold path.

10:10.680 --> 10:15.960
You might not see it in "eight" terms, as the Buddha described it, but you would see exactly

10:15.960 --> 10:21.920
what that path is in the broad strokes, sense restraint, guarding of the sense doors,

10:21.920 --> 10:26.200
not acting out, and doing things on the right level until this gratuitous aversion towards discomfort

10:26.200 --> 10:29.880
is abandoned, which is craving. Gratuitous aversion towards discomfort that you take

10:29.880 --> 10:32.920
for granted is your craving.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.000
Gratuitous delight towards comfort is your craving.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.640
That's how... there's no thing, a craving, that you can witness with your senses.

10:39.640 --> 10:45.760
It's always the background context that's maintained through careless attitude of pleasure.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.080
I'm leaning towards just, just by default, no reason.

10:50.080 --> 10:58.280
And the reason is you haven't considered well, thoroughly, frequently, often enough that

10:58.280 --> 11:00.280
leaning towards pleasure is actually dangerous.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.760
That's the danger.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.880
Not presence or absence of pleasure in the world and everything in my cup.

11:04.880 --> 11:11.040
No, it's leaning is the trap, accepting that attitude is how you get trapped, leaning away

11:11.040 --> 11:15.760
from pain, just gratuitously, no, not wanting it.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.360
It's like, why?

11:17.360 --> 11:22.400
Oh, because you never really considered it thoroughly on that level.

11:22.400 --> 11:27.440
TT: That leaning towards, that's the longing.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
AN: Leaning away, that's the aversion.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.440
TT: That's the stench.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
AN: Yeah, that's the stench.

11:30.440 --> 11:34.280
TT: And then the suffering, the flies, flies, the flies.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.640
AN: That's all the consequences of it.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.840
So if there is no leaning, there would be no flies.

11:40.840 --> 11:44.000
If there is no leaning towards pleasure, there would be no lust or thoughts.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.200
If there is no leaning away from pain, i.e. aversion, craving, there would be no angry

11:50.200 --> 11:53.280
thoughts, no thoughts of ill will, no thoughts of discomfort or discontent.

11:53.280 --> 12:05.120
That's what I mean, all the thoughts and hindrances and everything else are the symptoms of the problem,

12:05.120 --> 12:09.200
problem of your craving.

12:09.200 --> 12:17.800
TT: So this is the verse at the end of that sutta, it says: "The flies, thoughts based on lust

12:17.800 --> 12:24.400
will run in pursuit of one unrestrained, in the sense faculties, unguarded.

12:24.400 --> 12:31.800
A bhikkhu who is polluted, tainted by a stench, is far from nibbāna and reaps only distress.

12:31.800 --> 12:36.640
Whether in the village or the forest, the unwise foolish person, not having gained

12:36.640 --> 12:41.360
peace for himself, goes around followed by flies.

12:41.360 --> 12:47.560
But those accomplished in virtuous behaviour, who delight in wisdom and peace,

12:47.560 --> 12:54.680
those peaceful ones live happily, having destroyed the flies."

12:54.680 --> 12:57.000
TT: Having destroyed the flies, starved them away.

12:57.000 --> 13:21.120
AN: They'll die away.
